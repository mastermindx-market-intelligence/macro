<span class="co-h">Learning objective</span>
Understand what a 52-week high measures, why price often continues after a new high rather than reversing, and how to use distance-from-high as a trend gauge — without treating any of that as a promise.
</div>

<p>A 52-week high is simply the highest price traded in the trailing 365 calendar days. It is a rolling lookback, not a fixed annual reset. Nothing magical happens at the line: the stock does not know it is there. What matters is what the level encodes about the market's recent behavior.</p>

<h2>The calculation</h2>

<div class="formula">
52-week high = max(price) over the trailing 252 trading sessions (≈ 365 calendar days)
<br>
where "price" = closing or intraday high, per your screen's convention
<br>
Distance from high = (current price − 52-week high) / 52-week high × 100
</div>

<p>Some screens use <em>closing</em> highs; others use <em>intraday</em> highs. The difference matters. A stock can print an intraday 52-week high and close below its prior-session close — a different signal than closing at the highest level in a year. When comparing screener results, check which convention the tool uses.</p>

<h2>Why highs cluster: momentum persistence explained mechanically</h2>

<p>When a stock breaks through the top of its recent range, it has no overhead supply of shares bought at lower prices still waiting to sell. Every holder is currently sitting on a gain. This removal of overhead resistance is a structural condition, not a prediction: it describes who is currently underwater (no one) rather than who will buy next. Separately, institutional mandates that require purchasing high-momentum names mechanically direct capital toward names near their highs, which reinforces the price action. Neither observation is a guarantee — it is a description of the mechanics that make clustering a base-rate phenomenon rather than a coincidence.</p>

<h2>Closing vs. intraday highs</h2>

<p>A closing 52-week high requires conviction sustained through the session — sellers had a full day to push price back and did not. An intraday high can be a spike driven by a single large order followed by immediate reversal. For trend-following purposes, closing highs carry more weight. For volatility and liquidity analysis, intraday data is more informative. Use the one that matches your question.</p>

<h2>Distance-from-high as a trend gauge</h2>

<div class="formula">
Distance from high (%) = (current price − 52wk high) / 52wk high × 100
</div>

<div class="worked">
<span class="co-h">Worked example</span>
<p>Stock A: current price $94, 52-week high $100. Distance = (94 − 100) / 100 × 100 = <strong>−6%</strong>. The stock is 6% below its annual high — still within a normal pullback range for a trending name.</p>
<p>Stock B: current price $55, 52-week high $100. Distance = (55 − 100) / 100 × 100 = <strong>−45%</strong>. The stock is nearly half off its annual high — a different regime entirely, typical of names in repair mode rather than leadership.</p>
</div>

<p>Distance-from-high is useful for sorting: stocks within 5–10% of their annual high are often in the leadership tier; stocks 30–50% below are often in base-building or downtrend territory. The number is descriptive, not prescriptive.</p>

<h2>Common trap: "all-time high = expensive"</h2>

<p>The idea that a stock at a high must be expensive is a base-rate question, not a valuation statement. A price at an all-time high tells you nothing directly about what the business is worth relative to its price — it tells you about recent price history. Whether something is cheap or expensive requires an earnings estimate, a multiple, or a cash flow model. Conflating "price is high" with "valuation is high" is a category error that causes traders to systematically avoid strong businesses and favor weak ones purely on price history. Inexpensive stocks can be expensive on fundamentals; expensive-looking prices can be cheap. The level is not the answer.</p>

<h2>When this breaks</h2>

<p>The momentum-persistence logic assumes relatively normal market conditions. In broad market selloffs, stocks making new 52-week highs lose their overhead-supply advantage because the whole market is creating new supply of sellers. In thin or illiquid names, a single print can establish a false 52-week high that disappears on the next session. And in stocks where the 52-week high was set during a one-day earnings spike that was subsequently retraced, the level may not represent any meaningful supply zone — it is an artifact of a single event, not a prolonged price acceptance.</p>

<summary>Self-check: 3 questions</summary>
<ol>
<li><strong>A screener shows Stock X hit a 52-week high on Tuesday, but it closed below Monday's close. What likely happened, and which type of high did the screener use?</strong><br>The screener almost certainly tracks intraday highs. Stock X printed a new intraday extreme — possibly on a single large order — but could not sustain it through the close. A closing-high screener would not have flagged it.</li>
<li><strong>Stock Y is priced at $42. Its 52-week high is $60. What is its distance-from-high, and what does that suggest about its trend regime?</strong><br>Distance = (42 − 60) / 60 × 100 = −30%. A 30% discount to its annual high places it in repair or downtrend territory, not in the leadership tier where momentum-clustering effects tend to operate.</li>
<li><strong>Why does "price at an all-time high" not mean "overvalued"?</strong><br>A price level describes recent trading history, not the relationship between price and business value. Determining valuation requires earnings, cash flows, or a comparable multiple — not a comparison to historical prices. A business growing rapidly can be cheap at all-time-high prices; a declining business can be expensive at a 52-week low.</li>
