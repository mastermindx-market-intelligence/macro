## In plain English

> **What is being measured:** The outcome metric `hit` equals 1 when the signal achieved *any* positive favorable excursion versus the benchmark within 21 sessions of firing (i.e., `outcome_excess > 0`). The metric is floored at zero — it is an achieved-favorable-excursion indicator, not a signed return or a 'beat the market' measure. The base rate across all fires is approximately 88% (roughly 12% of fires never achieved any favorable excursion). The delta reported here measures how much MORE OFTEN hostile-window fires FAIL to achieve any favorable excursion compared to benign-window fires. A negative delta means hostile fires reach favorable excursion less often than benign fires.  
>
> **What is being asked:** When a macro condition is hostile at the time a signal fires — when rates are rising fast, the dollar is surging, credit spreads are blowing out, or financial conditions are tight — does the signal's favorable excursion rate change versus normal times? Each macro axis is tested separately (never combined). The verdict requires the hostile-vs-benign gap to be stable across two time periods AND the bootstrap confidence interval to exclude zero in both periods.  
>
> **Family composition caveat:** The spine fires are drawn from four signal families (sell, buy, cut, rebuy) in unequal proportions. The hostile arm may have a different mix of these families than the benign arm. The pooled stratified delta is NOT decomposed for family mix — part of the observed delta may reflect composition differences rather than macro transmission. Per-family within-deltas are reported descriptively; treat them as hypothesis-generating, not as verdicts.  
>
> Any axis that passes this gate re-opens the question of whether macro conditioning should be wired into the signal engine (subject to further approval and a separate masterplan). A fail means the gap is not reliably there. Either outcome is informative and is printed honestly.

## Pre-committed branches

- **P0-PASS(axis):** that axis re-opens the L6 charter question at the docket (two-lobe cap + separate masterplan+prereg still required; no live flag, chip, world_state key, or per-name output ships from this study).
- **P0-FAIL:** null printed; L6 stays gated; noisy-sector precedent stands as honest ceiling.
- **P0-DEFER:** floors or data unmet; achieved counts printed above with come-back condition.

*Opus stats review required before verdict is acted on. Fable adjudicates. This report is a contamination surface: any later prereg on this tape carries `derived_from_surface: macro_tx_phase0_v1`.*

## Fable adjudication (counter-sign, 2026-07-06)

**Verdict accepted: A1 rates_shock P0-PASS; A2/A3/A4 P0-FAIL.** The Opus stats review attempted to overturn A1 via corrected pre-1993 stratification (_GSPC 1927→), a multiplicity-preserving block bootstrap (CIs widened ~24%), an episode-level cluster bootstrap, and corrected BH pairing — the PASS survived all of them, and the modern-cohort (≥2015) delta is stronger than full-sample. Per prereg §5, **the L6 charter question is RE-OPENED at the docket** — NOT chartered: the two-lobe cap (L1+L3) still binds, and a charter requires its own masterplan + prereg.

Conditions attached (C1–C4):
- **C1:** any future L6 masterplan must treat this endpoint as what it is — a floored-at-zero favorable-excursion indicator (~88% base rate) — and pre-register any signed/return endpoint as a separate question.
- **C2:** the family-composition confound (pooled delta dominated by sell/cut fires; buy ≈ −0.55pp near-null) must be decomposed before any charter claims a transmission mechanism; a rates-conditioned read on BUY-side fires specifically is the load-bearing open question.
- **C3:** this report is a contamination surface — any later prereg on this tape carries `derived_from_surface: macro_tx_phase0_v1` with a compensating gate.
- **C4:** no display integration (flag, chip, world_state key, kernel cell) ships from this study; display happens only if L6 is ever chartered.
