# Cycle Intelligence Masterplan — by Fable

**As of 2026-07-02.** The solution half of the cycle-intelligence program. The problem half is
`research/CYCLE_INTELLIGENCE_PROBLEM_AUDIT_FOR_FABLE.md` (89 verified findings, macro#890). This document
is the arbitrated, red-teamed, dependency-ordered plan to turn the cycle platform into an institutional-grade,
evergreen, *measured* prediction system — and the delegation contract for the wave sub-sessions that will
build it.

> **Provenance.** Produced by a 14-agent design fleet against canonical `main`: 5 feasibility scouts
> (ground-truthed data bases, PIT-reconstructability, calibration state, FX availability, reusable infra),
> 5 pillar designers (D1 ontology, D2 measurement, D3 flagships, D4 substrate, D5 prediction), and a 4-agent
> adversarial red team (statistics, architecture/ops, product honesty, completeness) that attacked the
> combined designs. Every fatal/serious attack is arbitrated below with a ruling. Full pillar designs,
> red-team reports, and scout ground truth are committed under `research/cycle_masterplan/` — wave
> sub-sessions read those, not this summary.

## 0 · The doctrine — what "institutional grade" means here

Ten operating principles. Every wave either enforces one of these or it doesn't ship.

1. **The engine owns every plotted number.** Narrative may annotate; it may never set a position, phase,
   turn date, or cone. Enforced by build-time assertion, not convention.
2. **Every claim carries its evidence class.** `MEASURED` (graded, n + CI shown) / `EXPERIMENTAL` (accruing,
   registered in the Experiments tracker with a come-back date) / `FRAME` (structural clock, never graded,
   falsifier-monitored) / `OPINION` (dated, TTL'd, staleness-badged). The UI renders the class; nothing
   ships unclassified. **User-facing vocabulary is exactly two words — MEASURED and FRAME** (red-team
   ruling R3-F1: the intermediate tiers live in a hover "how computed" line, never as competing chips).
3. **A probability is a promise.** Anything expressed as odds or a cone gets reliability-tracked (Brier vs
   base rate, coverage vs nominal). If we won't grade it, we don't express it as a probability.
4. **Calibration binds or it lies.** A calibration artifact that doesn't feed the shipped score is a rigor
   costume. Scores, tier cuts, stance mappings and cone widths are *fit*, versioned, diffed-and-alerted on
   refresh.
5. **"Validated" is a file, not a word.** The label requires a stored verdict artifact (window, n_eff, CI,
   exact claim tested); a grep gate (EN + zh + generated JS) blocks unearned uses.
6. **One ontology, compiled.** Position/phase/turn defined once in Python, *generated* into JS. Two pages
   can disagree only because the world's data disagrees, never about definitions.
7. **Point-in-time or it didn't happen.** Every stamp reconstructable from tape ≤ t. Mutable state
   (membership, narratives, live scrapes) is frozen at stamp time (hash) or excluded from grading.
   **Backtest and live cohorts never blend in one badge** — `BACKTEST n=…` flips to `LIVE n=…` only when
   the prospective cohort matures (R3 ruling).
8. **Small n is a disclosure, not a shame.** Pool cross-sectionally (hazard pooling, shrinkage) to earn n
   where legitimate; where impossible (18-yr cycles), say FRAME and monitor falsifiers instead of
   pretending to grade.
9. **Risk levers are not return levers.** Gates validated only for drawdown reduction size positions; they
   never vote direction.
10. **Evergreen means zero hand-edits to stay true.** Wall-clock TODAY, auto-refreshed reads, TTL'd prose,
    tripwires that alert. A page that needs a human to remain honest will eventually be dishonest.

## 0.5 · The collapse map — 89 findings → 7 systems (+ the input pillar the net caught)

| # | System | Kills which findings | Pillar |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | **Ontology contract** — canonical position `100·Φ(z)`, master 5-phase wheel + crosswalk, ONE turn primitive with `confirmed_at`, `resolve_state()` state machine | all position/phase/turn incompatibilities; contradictory cards; 4-detector fragmentation | D1 |
| S2 | **Data-substrate contract** — dual-basis store (`close_price` split-adj/div-unadj + `close_tr`), FX decomposition, basis-matched benchmarks, frozen basket levels | every TR-mislabeled-as-price finding; FX conflation; grader benchmark bias; basket survivorship | D4 |
| S3 | **Measurement engine** — PIT backfill (the `asof=` hook already exists), `grading_stats` shared library, turn P/R + cone coverage + reliability, binding calibration | empty graders; no-CI/tiny-n/overlap findings; decorative + inverted calibration | D2 |
| S4 | **Prediction layer** — pooled discrete-time hazard (two direction models, ~2,400–2,600 confirmed turns verified on disk), shrunken conditional cells, regime-prior service | median-half-cycle projections; magic cones; hand-typed regime blocks; FWER-failing pathway pretense | D5 |
| S5 | **Flagship re-platform** — proxy registry (14 MEASURED / 2 proxy / 1 monthly / 4 FRAME / 4 DUAL), `record_series()` monthly+invert+abs-ZigZag kernel, engine-backed cycle.html, markets.html re-pointed at the country engine | every hand-curated flagship finding; frozen TODAY; drawdown-exponential position; fake convergence bands; duplicate coverage | D3 |
| S6 | **Honesty surface** — falsifier tripwire compiler (18/23 at least partially machine-evaluable), narrative TTL + tolerance assertions, MEASURED/FRAME badges, provenance-of-revision | decorative falsifiers; stale narrative overrides; "Live read" mislabeling | D3/D2 |
| S7 | **Interaction layer** — pre-registered lead-lag phase-0 with a hard STOP rule; sync gauge if it fails | isolated clocks; fake synchronized-inflection bands | D5 |
| S8 | **Input repair** (added by the completeness net) — China setup-composite era-stabilization, business_cycle OOS recalibration + ALFRED vintages, pathway HARD-gate refit, DC/IC bands fit from measured trough spacing | china-sector-cycles-1 (CRITICAL, previously unowned), macro-regime-2/-5/-6, cycles-core-2, country PIT residuals | **D6 (new)** |

Dependency spine: **S2 → S1 → S3 → (S8) → S4 → (S5, S6) → S7.**

Scout ground truth that reshaped the plan (full notes in `research/cycle_masterplan/S*.md`):
`sector_cycles.compute(asof=…)` **already slices PIT-correctly** — the backfill is a loop, not a new engine;
**Shenwan sectors are already price-basis** (China spine needs *no* destructive re-key — the audit
over-scoped); yfinance `auto_adjust=False` returns both `Close` (split-adj, div-unadj — exactly what ZigZag
needs) and `Adj Close` (byte-identical to today's stored close) so the substrate fix is **purely additive**;
1,883 confirmed turns already exist on the 35 US+country ETFs alone (hazard model is estimable); the repo
has zero sklearn/statsmodels — all stats hand-rolled numpy (already house style in the china grader).

## 1 · Arbitration record — red-team rulings

The red team raised 4 fatals, ~14 serious. Rulings (full attack text in `research/cycle_masterplan/R*.md`):

| # | Attack (severity) | Ruling |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | **Basis-ordering contradiction** — D4 forbade grading on TR; D2/D5 backfill TR-first (fatal) | **TR-first, dev-only.** The TR-v0 backfill runs immediately but is *research-facing only* (feeds the keystone gate W0.4); no user-facing badge is ever computed on TR. First badge cohort = price basis after W2.2. D4's gate re-scoped from global to **per-epoch** (no mixing within one grade run; archived epochs coexist). |
| A2 | **`n_eff = n/h` ignores cross-sectional correlation** of ~30 co-moving ETFs (fatal) | **Delete the n/h Wilson path.** All cell inference via whole-month block bootstrap; W4.1 estimates ρ̂ (within-month cross-sectional correlation) as a first-class artifact; every cell reports n_months, not n_rows. |
| A3 | **Tier taxonomy metastasized** to 5 tiers + 6 chips (fatal, product) | **Two words: MEASURED / FRAME.** proxy/monthly/dual/prior demoted to hover-line. DUAL = a MEASURED card with a thin secular-context strip. |
| A4 | **China setup composite unowned** — the audit's only China-critical finding had no design (fatal, completeness) | **New pillar D6** (input repair): composite era-stabilization, pathway HARD-gate walk-forward refit, business_cycle LORO+ALFRED recalibration, DC/IC band fitting, country PIT residuals. |
| A5 | **Four incompatible re-key schemes** across D1/D2/D3/D4 (serious) | **D1 owns turn identity.** One `turn_id = series:kind:YYYY-MM`, one half-cycle-scaled tolerance, one file scheme `narratives.<epoch>.json`. The three version keys collapse to **one `turn_epoch` = hash(basis, zz_params, detector_version)** — an epoch bump atomically re-keys narratives, re-runs backfill, re-fits hazard, re-stamps the experiments registry. |
| A6 | **Backfill badge is synthetic self-consistency; turn-P/R is circular** (same detector as ground truth) (serious) | Badges say `BACKTEST n=` until live cohort matures. Turn-P/R gets an **independent turn truth** (realized-extrema definition: argmin/argmax within ±window of ≥X% moves, spec'd in W2.4) so the detector isn't graded against itself. |
| A7 | **Hazard/conditional stack = biggest build, weakest decision-linkage** (serious) | Pre-registration (W0.4 deliverable) names the *decision* each D5 output must move (e.g. hazard cone replaces IQR band only if walk-forward entry-sizing on it improves drawdown-adjusted outcomes). Conditional cells ship as a research surface until they clear it. D5-W8 (novel features) **cut** to research backlog. |
| A8 | **Age-dial = n≈2 false precision** inside the tier built to forbid it (serious) | Dial deleted. FRAME cards show the curated turn timeline + "last major turn {date} ({N}y ago); prior up-legs ran {list}" + tripwire strip. Nothing on a FRAME resolves to a scalar position. |
| A9 | **markets.html burial** — both nav identities are live; folding to a tab buries 9 curated market narratives (serious) | Keep the page + nav identity; **re-point its data** at the country_cycles engine; kill the duplicate engine + posFromDrawdown + convergence bands. D1's adoption ledger targets the re-pointed page. |
| A10 | **Ops fantasy** — "cron is free" vs a serialized 120-min 2-core weekly lane; no wave owned `.github/workflows`; resilient `run_py` makes fail-closed gates fail-open (serious) | New ops wave W1.5: dedicated `cycle-calibration.yml` (own concurrency group), measured wall-times summed against the lane budget, every gate declares **abort-lane vs log-and-skip**, load-bearing gates (validated-grep, epoch homogeneity, stale-tape) run in `ci.yml` as hard steps. |
| A11 | **Runtime `fetch()` assumed; platform is 100% script-tag** (serious) | All new artifacts ship as `window.X = {…}` data-JS via `<script src>`, like every existing page. |
| A12 | **Flag-day axis flip can ship half-applied** across 3 builder scripts (serious) | Flip gated on one committed constant (`ONTOLOGY_AXIS`) read by ALL builders; `gen_ontology_js.py` runs as the FIRST weekly-lane step + a `--check` ci step. |
| A13 | **`cone_coverage` defined twice; `_project_next` edited by two pillars; `grading_stats` triple-owned** (serious) | Ownership table (§3): D2 owns `grading_stats` (one `cone_coverage`, nominal 80%); D1 owns `_project_next` overdue rewrite (fixing lo/hi edges too — the *whole cone* currently re-anchors daily); D5 consumes both. `cycles.analyze(price=)` kwarg owned by D4 with D1 review. |
| A14 | **Regime features under-powered + revision-leaky** (quad has no vintages) (serious) | Blocs dropped from the hazard panel entirely; month-block-bootstrap SEs; each regime feature must clear its own CI or is dropped; lagged-quad robustness refit is a gate; quad-conditioned skill labeled *revision-optimistic* until D6-W3 lands vintage handling. |
| A15 | **Skill-gate power + no program-level multiple-testing budget** (~20 pre-registered gates ⇒ ~2 pass by luck) (serious) | One **pre-registration ledger** (`research/cycle_masterplan/PREREGISTRATION.md`, created in W0.4) lists every gate with success criteria + expected pass rates; BH-FDR applied within gate families; family-stratified KM baseline (anti-gaming). |
| A16 | Monthly-only stamping silences the one *daily*-granularity product (ladder) (minor) | Phase wheel graded monthly; ladder/timing states graded at native daily cadence *with* the overlap deflator built for exactly this. |
| A17 | FIRED-latch strands a recovered thesis; proxy cards show the proxy's position as the cycle's (minor×2) | FIRED shows current-leg state beside the latch; proxy cards show validated turn *timing* only — position gauge suppressed. |
| A18 | i18n: 9 stance tones × zh color-flip undefined for direction-less stances; number-interpolated dual-spans; nav guard for measurement.html (minor) | Ontology declares `tone: bullish|bearish|neutral` per stance (neutral = no flip); FRAME strings avoid number-in-span interpolation; `check_nav_mega`/`check_nav_gap` run in W3.7's acceptance. |

---

## 2 · The pillars (condensed — full designs in `research/cycle_masterplan/D*.md`)

**D1 · Ontology** — `engine/cycle_ontology.py`; canonical position `100·Φ(z)` with z = EMA-detrended log
residual / EWMA vol (causal vol floor), per-frequency params D(252)/W(52)/M(36); refutes both the
range-stochastic (peaks span 17.6–99.7) and drawdown-as-position (conflates cycle with secular regime).
5×8 phase×ladder crosswalk → 9 stances with explicit `divergence` flag ("clocks disagree" is a state, not a
contradiction); Peak×BOTTOM WATCH ⇒ COUNTERTREND ONLY, never a naked buy. ZigZag = THE turn detector,
extended with `confirmed_at`/`confirm_lag_bars` (exists nowhere today — without it every turn grade and
hazard fit leaks); `find_troughs` demoted to declared timing sub-detector. Stable month-quantized
`turn_id` + tolerance migrator defuses the re-key bomb and finally unfreezes the 14% threshold. Generated
JS is data + lookups only — no logic twice.

**D2 · Measurement** — backfill is a loop over the existing `compute(asof=…)`; parallel
`backfill.parquet` + provenance column (live ledger stays append-only keep-FIRST); scope-honest (only the 3
membership-free families backfill; baskets/sector_central overlays excluded as non-PIT per scout S2).
`engine/grading_stats.py` extracted from the china grader (library-not-copy). Three promise-graders: turn
P/R (independent truth per A6), cone coverage (recalibrates half-width from realized error — killing
`lerp(1.5,13)`), reliability/Brier vs per-instrument base rate. Binding calibration on the drawdown-lens
walk-forward; `cycles.py:1038` reads the artifact, static dict becomes fallback. Discovered en route:
**cone edges were never logged anywhere** — prospective cone coverage was unmeasurable until W0.2 adds
`proj_lo/hi` columns.

**D3 · Flagships** — proxy registry census: **14 MEASURED** (mostly by *series substitution* — GC=F, HG=F,
SI=F, DCOILWTICO, BAMLH0A0HYM2, VIXCLS, DGS30, BTC-USD carry no dividend adjustment, sidestepping the TR
problem entirely — a stronger move than dual columns for flagships), 2 MEASURED-proxy behind an earned
turn-match fitness gate (MU→DRAM, CCJ→U₃O₈; Wilson-bounded per A6/R1), 1 MEASURED-monthly (ISM), 4
honestly-FRAME (paywalled or n≈2), 4 DUAL (gold/dollar/japan/bitcoin genuinely carry a gradeable
intermediate cycle *and* an ungradeable secular frame). `record_series(freq, invert, zz_abs)` kernel
wrapper — credit/vol/bonds cycle on inverted series; regression gate = byte-identical rebuild of the three
existing engine pages. Falsifier DSL compiles 10/23 fully + 8 partially; the 5 non-compilable get a
first-class manual state with TTL + overdue digest. Traps caught: `PL` parquet is Planet Labs, not
platinum; FRED's 3-year default window means new monthly series need a one-time deep-history seed.

**D4 · Substrate** — verified: `auto_adjust=False` yields both columns; `Adj Close`→`close` is
basis-preserving so the store change is **purely additive** (no existing number moves; real cost ~8MB, the
designer's 96MB estimate was 12× high per R2). Per-engine atomic flips (read-flip + narratives-v2 +
log-archive in one commit); existing single-date logs discarded and re-stamped (nothing matured = nothing
lost). China spine exempt (already price-basis). Countries: local-currency series (native index where
history permits, else synthetic ETF/FX), FX as a separate graded leg with per-turn `fx_share`; default card
shows the local cycle + a flag when FX drove >60% of a USD turn (full leg in a drawer, per R3). Frozen
daily basket levels + membership hash; truncation ⇒ grade invalidation, never silent re-score.
`scripts/audit_price_basis.py` joins the audit-gate family (AST scan authoritative; `.attrs` demoted to
dev aid per R2).

**D5 · Prediction** — two discrete-time logistic hazards (peak/trough — cycle asymmetry is first-order) on
an instrument-month person-period panel; ~2,400–2,600 confirmed turns verified; family dummies +
own-history-normalized age (k=6 blend) instead of hierarchical Bayes (zero new deps); hand-rolled numpy
logistic + PAV isotonic. **The skill bar is the age-only Kaplan-Meier hazard** (the median-half-cycle prior
formalized), not a coin flip: a (direction,horizon) cell ships model output only if OOS Brier beats KM with
a block-bootstrap CI excluding zero — else the KM prior ships, badged PRIOR. Conditional phase×quad cells
with James-Stein shrinkage (whole-month bootstrap inference per A2). `regime_prior.js` single conditioning
artifact + reconciliation banners; `market_state` is display-prior only (no PIT history — it cannot be a
feature until snapshots accrue, a new problem D5 found). Lead-lag: two-stage pre-registered phase-0
(FDR-screened cross-correlation on ≤2017 train → frozen top-20 pairs → OOS Brier-lift ≥2% pooled with CI
excluding 0) with a **hard STOP to a sync gauge** on failure.

**D6 · Input repair (new, from the completeness net)** — the China setup composite silently averages 2
legs pre-2017 vs 4 post-2019 (the audit's only China CRITICAL): fixed constituent set + availability
masking + composition-version stamp. Pathway HARD gate refit walk-forward (currently a full-sample
look-ahead percentile on 3–4 turns). business_cycle: leave-one-recession-out calibration + ALFRED vintages
+ symmetric publication lags + remove the silent threshold override + `cl_ratio` rebase fix. DC/IC bands
fit from the measured trough-spacing census (replacing cycle-theory numerology). Country live-builder PIT
residuals (RS window re-slice on asof; thin-market flag). China spine truncation guard.

### New problems found while designing (beyond the audit's 89)

The design + red-team pass surfaced **~30 additional problems**. The load-bearing ones:

- **`confirmed_at` exists nowhere** — no consumer records when a turn became knowable; any turn grading or
  hazard fit keyed on pivot dates leaks knowledge backwards (D1; feeds A6).
- **The engine's own projection re-anchors daily** — `_project_next`'s `max(0.05, med−since)` floor makes an
  overdue cycle perpetually "imminent" and unmissable-by-construction; the lo/hi cone edges walk forward too
  (D1/D5, verified by R2).
- **Cone edges never logged** — cone coverage was retroactively unmeasurable (D2).
- **`market_state` has no PIT history** — the site-wide SSOT verdict cannot be a model feature or be graded
  until daily snapshots accrue (D5).
- **Live drift proof** — sector_cycles claims its phase hues are "identical" to cycle_data.js; 3 of 5
  differ today. Hand-mirroring has already failed (D1).
- **Phase wheel has zero hysteresis** — a one-week MACD wobble flips Expansion↔Downturn, resetting
  `phase_age` and polluting the hazard's age covariate (D1; handled in W1.2).
- **Ticker collision trap** — `PL.parquet` is Planet Labs; a naive platinum add plots a satellite company
  as a metals cycle (D3).
- **FRED 3-year truncation** — newly added monthly series are useless for cycle work without a one-time
  deep-history seed (D3).
- **Turn-count heterogeneity** — confirmed turns range 7 (XLC) to 112 (EWZ); per-instrument stats on thin
  names are noise; every per-instrument surface needs a pooled fallback (D5).
- **Backfill re-runs orphan experiment come-back dates** unless the epoch bump auto-re-stamps the registry
  (R2 second-order; fixed in W4.8).
- Basket FRAME-not-graded is **permanent** for the pre-freeze span (no per-member add/remove dates) —
  declared, not hidden (D4/R1).

## 3 · Ownership table (the seam contract)

| Object | Owner | Consumers |
|---|---|---|
| `turn_id`, `turn_epoch`, `match_turns` re-keyer | **D1** (W2.1) | D2, D3, D4 import — no local schemes |
| `_project_next` overdue rewrite (incl. lo/hi edges) | **D1** (W1.6) | D5 consumes `overdue`/`overdue_frac` |
| `engine/grading_stats.py` (incl. the ONE `cone_coverage`, nominal 80%) | **D2** (W1.1) | all graders, D5 |
| `cycles.analyze(price=)` kwarg | **D4** (W2.2, D1 reviews) | all engines |
| Proxy registry (`bands:[]` schema — tier attaches to a band, not a cycle) | **D3** (W3.1) | D1 ontology, D5 panel |
| `regime_prior.js` | **D5** (W4.5) | all cycle pages |
| `.github/workflows/*` (lane budget, gate semantics) | **W1.5** | everyone |
| Pre-registration ledger + FDR budget | **W0.4** (created), **W4.2** (enforced) | every gate |

## 4 · The program — waves, tiers, acceptance

~34 waves in 6 phases. **The bolded 15 waves are the Minimum Viable Spine** — the subset that captures
~80% of the value (per R3's scope attack); everything else can trail. Each wave = one sub-session, one
branch off main, one PR, squash-merged same day. Wave prompts must link the relevant
`research/cycle_masterplan/D*.md` section — the sub-session implements a spec, it does not re-derive
design.

### Phase 0 — Stop the rot + the keystone question (week 1)

| Wave | Tier | Scope | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|
| **W0.1** | sonnet | Wall-clock TODAY on cycle.html/markets.html; explicit elapsed-turn state (dimmed cone + "window passed" chip); staleness banners; delete the `Math.max` push-forward. D3 §7. | Pages render correctly with system date mocked ±1yr; elapsed turns show the chip, never a fresh cone; i18n dual-span. |
| **W0.2** | sonnet | Forward-log writers for US sector_cycles + country_cycles (missing entirely today); add `proj_lo/hi/cone_pct` columns to ALL writers. D2-W2. | Next weekly run stamps all three families incl. cone edges; keep-FIRST invariant tested. |
| **W0.3** | sonnet | Benchmark basis-match in the China graders; flip `sector_cycles.js:1001` so the engine read wins (narrative demoted to labeled overlay). Audit Phase-0 + D4-W2. | Excess computed same-basis (test with synthetic dividend series); narrative renders as dated overlay. |
| **W0.4** | opus | **THE KEYSTONE GATE**: TR-v0 dev-only backfill over the membership-free universes + the minimal "does position/phase predict forward drawdown-adjusted returns" walk-forward study (R3-M4). Creates `PREREGISTRATION.md` with every downstream gate + FDR budget. | A verdict artifact: per-decile forward outcomes with block-bootstrap CIs. **This is the audit's biggest open question answered in one wave** — and it steers W4 scope. |

### Phase 1 — Foundations (parallel tracks)

| Wave | Tier | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| **W1.1** | sonnet | `engine/grading_stats.py` extraction + china-grader refactor to import it (one implementation; one `cone_coverage`). |
| **W1.2** | sonnet | `engine/cycle_ontology.py` + `gen_ontology_js.py` (+ `--check` ci step): position `100·Φ(z)`, crosswalk matrix, 9 stances with zh tone mapping, phase hysteresis, coherence tests. Stance matrix registered as a bindable artifact from day one (A17/R3). |
| **W1.3** | sonnet | Dual-basis store: collector flag, `close_price` column, `yahoo_closes(basis=)`, full-history backfill; **hard gate**: byte-safety (`close≡AdjClose`) verified on ≥1 non-US ETF + 1 index before any flip. |
| W1.4 | haiku | Collection gaps: FX pairs, local indices, FRED deep-history seeds (CSUSHPISA, HOUST, DCOILWTICO, DHHNGSP…), futures proxies (`PL=F`/`PA=F` pinned — never `PL`). |
| **W1.5** | sonnet | Ops: `cycle-calibration.yml` (own concurrency group), measured wall-times vs the 120-min lane, every gate declared abort-lane vs log-and-skip, hard gates into `ci.yml`. |
| **W1.6** | sonnet | Kernel integration: `resolve_state()` live in `_record_core` (data-only, UI unchanged); `_project_next` overdue rewrite (D1 owns; lo/hi edges included). |

### Phase 2 — Migration + measurement

| Wave | Tier | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| **W2.1** | opus | The `turn_epoch` primitive + the ONE re-key migrator (`match_turns`, `narratives.<epoch>.json`, orphan quarantine — curated turns never deleted). |
| **W2.2** | sonnet | Per-engine atomic basis flips (US sectors, countries; China spine exempt) + log archive + `audit_price_basis.py`. |
| **W2.3** | sonnet | Price-basis PIT backfill → `backfill.parquet` + provenance + `engine_fingerprint`; monthly cadence for the phase wheel, daily for the ladder (with overlap deflator, A16). |
| **W2.4** | opus | The three promise-graders: turn P/R with **independent realized-extrema truth** (A6), cone coverage → cone recalibration, reliability/Brier. `BACKTEST n=` vs `LIVE n=` badge discipline. |
| W2.5 | sonnet | Collinearity phase-0: correlation/VIF of state/trend/RS/hazard features on backfilled history — **gates W4.2 and W4.6** (R4's hard precondition). |
| **W2.6** | opus | D6: China setup-composite era-stabilization + pathway HARD-gate walk-forward refit. |
| W2.7 | opus | D6: business_cycle LORO recalibration + ALFRED vintages + publication-lag symmetry + threshold-override + `cl_ratio` fixes. |
| W2.8 | sonnet | D6: DC/IC bands fit from trough-spacing census; `cand_depth` preset parametrization; country RS PIT re-slice + thin-market flag; China spine truncation guard. |

### Phase 3 — Product surfaces

| Wave | Tier | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| **W3.1** | opus | Proxy registry (`bands:[]`) + `record_series()` kernel (monthly, invert, abs-ZigZag); byte-identical regression gate on the three existing engine pages. |
| **W3.2** | sonnet | Engine-backed cycle.html: MEASURED/FRAME two-word taxonomy, DUAL = measured card + secular strip, FRAME = curated timeline + leg-length list (no dial), hover "how computed". |
| **W3.3** | sonnet | Falsifier tripwire compiler + alert wiring + FIRED UX (latched + current-leg state) + manual-falsifier TTL for the 5 NONE cycles. |
| W3.4 | sonnet | Narrative overlay hardening: TTL, tolerance assertion, archetype mechanism-checks, provenance-of-revision changelog (R3-M1/M2). |
| W3.5 | sonnet | markets.html re-pointed at the country engine (page + nav identity kept; duplicate engine, posFromDrawdown, convergence bands deleted). |
| W3.6 | sonnet | Ontology page adoption + divergence UX + **cross-page consistency assertion** (same instrument agrees across pages within tolerance or shows a declared basis label — R3-M3). |
| **W3.7** | sonnet | `site/measurement.html` hub (script-tag data) + per-card badges; nav guards (`check_nav_mega`/`check_nav_gap`) in acceptance. |
| W3.8 | sonnet | Frozen basket levels + membership hash + truncation invalidation. |
| W3.9 | sonnet | FX decomposition UX: local-currency country cycles, `fx_share` flag >60%, full FX leg in drawer. |

### Phase 4 — Prediction + binding

| Wave | Tier | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| W4.1 | sonnet | Hazard panel + family-stratified KM baselines + ρ̂ estimation; blocs dropped. |
| W4.2 | opus | Hazard fit: month-block bootstrap SEs, isotonic calibration, per-cell skill gates vs KM with BH-FDR, decision-linkage gates from PREREGISTRATION.md; regime features clear own CI or drop; lagged-quad robustness. |
| W4.3 | sonnet | Wire hazard into records/cones (PRIOR fallback badged; overdue consumed from D1) + i18n. |
| W4.4 | sonnet | Conditional phase×quad cells (whole-month bootstrap only; James-Stein shrinkage) — ships as research surface until its decision gate passes (A7). |
| W4.5 | sonnet | `regime_prior.js` service + reconciliation banners (display-prior until D6-W3 vintages); begin persisting daily `market_state` snapshots so it can *become* a feature. |
| **W4.6** | opus | Binding calibration: LADDER_SCORE / tier cuts / stance matrix fit from the walk-forward (drawdown lens); artifact diff-and-alert; validated-grep gate (EN+zh+generated JS). |
| W4.7 | opus | Position-v2 acceptance study + `ONTOLOGY_AXIS` committed-constant flip across all builders. |

## 5 · Delegation playbook

- **One wave = one sub-session** (Opus for judgment-heavy waves, Sonnet for well-specified implementation,
  Haiku for collection), one branch off canonical `main` (never the stale local branch — verify with
  `git fetch origin main` first), one PR, squash-merged same day.
- **The wave prompt contains:** the wave row above, the linked design-doc section(s) under
  `research/cycle_masterplan/`, the ownership-table rows it touches, and its executable acceptance gate.
  Sub-sessions implement; they do not re-litigate arbitrated rulings.
- **Every gate is executable** (pytest target / audit script / artifact diff). A wave without a runnable
  gate doesn't ship. Gates declare abort-lane vs log-and-skip semantics (A10).
- **Measurement waves register in the admin Experiments tracker** with come-back dates; epoch bumps
  re-stamp them (W4.8).
- **UI waves obey the house gotchas:** dual-span l-en/l-zh (never `t()` in attributes), zh up/down color
  flip driven by declared stance `tone`, mobile-fit at 375px, `preview_screenshot` scroll-0 only,
  nav-guard scripts on any nav change.
- **Status log** lives at the bottom of this file — every merged wave appends one line (PR#, date, gate
  result), same convention as the engine/mastermind masterplans.

## 6 · Risks & standing tensions (told straight)

1. **The keystone gate may return "no edge."** If W0.4 finds position/phase deciles carry no forward
   drawdown-adjusted signal, phases 3–5 shrink drastically and the honest product is tripwires + regime
   context + measurement — the doctrine survives even if the prediction thesis doesn't. This is a feature
   of the plan, not a failure mode. **→ FIRED 2026-07-02: see §6.5.**
2. **Most hazard cells will likely ship PRIOR initially** (R1's power analysis: absolute Brier gaps ~0.011
   at ~90 effective blocks). The plan says so up front; the KM prior is itself a large upgrade over the
   re-anchoring median projection.
3. **China/baskets/monthly cycles trail in v1** — "all assets" is delivered for US/country daily tapes
   first; the ledger declares what's excluded and why rather than papering over it (R4's "shrinking scope"
   attack, accepted and disclosed).
4. **New surfaces can rot like the old ones** — every new surface ships with its own staleness tripwire
   (SO1); provenance-of-revision (computed_on + epoch) is mandatory on every badge (SO2).
5. **Reflexivity** — once calibration binds, refits change live behavior with no code diff; the
   diff-and-alert + permanently-embargoed holdout (R1) is the containment.

## 6.5 · Post-keystone re-steer (2026-07-02 — BINDING on all downstream waves)

W0.4 ran on 8,344 leak-free PIT stamps (11 US sectors + 24 countries, month-end 2005–2026, spanning
2008/2020/2022). Full verdict: `research/cycle_masterplan/W04_KEYSTONE_VERDICT.md`. Findings:

- **Position → forward RETURN: NO-EDGE.** Every decile's gap-vs-base CI straddles 0 at 21/63/126d.
- **The only reproducible signal is RISK-ONLY and phase-keyed — with an inverted sign:** Peak phases →
  *shallower* forward drawdowns (63d p10-DD gap CI [+1.2%, +5.0%]), Trough → *deeper* ([−10.0%, −1.9%]).
  This is a vol-clustering fact (troughs live in high-vol regimes), not a timing signal — and it decays
  post-2018. Per doctrine #9 it may inform *risk sizing only*, never direction.
- **The audit's LADDER-inversion headline did NOT survive PIT + month-block bootstrap** — inconclusive on
  all 9 era×horizon cells. The true finding stands as the audit's other observation: *no ladder state
  separates from its base rate.* Treat the china `ladder_calibration.json` ordering as a point-estimate
  artifact.

**Scope consequences (binding):**
1. **W4.1–W4.4 (hazard + conditional cells) are demoted to a decision-gated research track** (DL-1/DL-2
   in `PREREGISTRATION.md`) — not a v1 sizing/cone engine. They may still ship as MEASURED research
   surfaces if their pre-registered gates pass; nothing they produce touches a card until then.
2. **W4.6 binding calibration is re-scoped to the risk channel** — there is no return-channel ordering to
   bind. The `mean_fwd/|dd_p10|` metric is denominator-dominated (ranks states by ambient vol);
   vol-residualize or fit risk/return channels separately. Expect pre-registered gate BC-1 to FAIL — that
   is the correct outcome; wave prompts must not assume it passes.
3. **W1.2's phase-hysteresis fix must land before W2.4** grades any phase-conditioned promise, or the
   graders inherit the phase-wobble noise the keystone study had to average through.
4. **Phases 0–3 are unchanged and now carry the product:** ontology coherence, honest measurement,
   engine-backed flagships, tripwires, MEASURED/FRAME, regime context. The platform's value proposition
   is *disciplined honesty + risk context*, with prediction claims earned cell-by-cell through the ledger
   — exactly what §6.1 pre-committed to.

## 6.6 · The first scorecards (2026-07-02 — BINDING addenda to §6.5)

Phases 1–2 + W2.4/W2.5 completed the measurement core and produced the program's first real
self-measurement (12,519 PIT stamps, 2010–2026, price basis). The verdicts, all against frozen
pre-registered gates (`research/cycle_masterplan/W24_FIRST_SCORECARDS.md`, `W25_COLLINEARITY_VERDICT.md`):

- **Turn-timing prediction is falsified as shipped.** Turn precision 0.075/0.109/0.230 (US/country/China)
  vs the 0.5 bar — CC-3 FAIL on all engines. Cone coverage 0.19–0.36 vs nominal 0.80 — CC-1 MISCALIBRATED;
  shipped recalibration multipliers: US 8.19×, country 3.57×, China 3.12× (`cone_recalibration.json`).
  Directional labels carry negative Brier skill (CC-2 FAIL). Dominant cause isolated: 25–35% of projections
  chronically overdue — the median-half-cycle projection engine is the weak link (watch the forward-only
  cone slice once a gated projection model replaces it).
- **The confluence was one signal in three coats.** `state_score`×`pos_osc` ρ=−0.968 (VIF~30);
  `state_score` has ZERO marginal information. Binding de-duplicated feature set for W4.2/W4.6:
  pos_osc + trend_pass + mom_score + rs_63d + vol_pctile + amp_proxy + osc_slope (+ regime axis, orthogonality
  assumed not measured). Risk-channel survivors with CIs: rs_63d (strongest), vol_pctile (both horizons).
- **Input repairs converged with the keystone:** China pathway lifts all straddle zero once era-stabilized
  (consumption/auto flipped negative; n_eff≈1) while the pooled causal turn-signature gate is real
  (CI [0.23,0.46] excludes 0); recession catch is 2/3 OOS not 3/3 (1990 missed; threshold −1.25→−1.0);
  DC/IC theory bands lost to the data (equity (36,42)→fitted (23,44); crypto (56,70)→(22,45)) and the
  fitted bands now bind.

**The consolidated read:** descriptive structure (confirmed turns, phase wheel, risk/vol clustering,
turn signatures) has measurable substance; every *predictive/conditioning* claim tested so far — position
deciles, ladder ordering, pathway conditioning, turn projections, directional labels — fails its gate.
Phase 3 (honest surfaces) is therefore the product; Phase 4 items proceed ONLY through their
pre-registered gates, feature-set-bound by W2.5, with the W2.4 scorecards as the baseline any model must
beat. FRAME/OPINION rendering and tripwires (W3.3+) carry the platform's value until something earns
MEASURED-prediction status.

## Status log

- 2026-07-03 — **W4.6 SHIPPED** (risk-channel binding calibration, re-scoped per §6.5 item 2). THE
  headline: **there is NO risk-sizing signal.** After vol-residualization (`rdd = fwd_maxdd /
  trailing_63d_vol`, the §6.5 fix to the denominator-dominated metric), **0 of 48 (state × family ×
  horizon) cells survive BH-FDR q=0.10** — the raw `ladder_calibration.json` drawdown ordering was
  ambient-vol clustering. **BC-1 (return channel, verbatim): FAIL** — train→holdout rank-corr = −0.119
  (bar >0.5; inverts OOS), exactly the pre-registered expectation. Every cell ships `risk_size_mult=1.0`.
  Deliverables: `scripts/fit_ladder_risk_calibration.py` + `data/regime/ladder_risk_calibration.json`
  (vol-resid DD stats, month-block bootstrap CIs, n_months, PERMANENTLY-EMBARGOED holdout
  `[2024-01-01, end]` declared+immutable, `validated:false`, per (phase×ladder) stance-evidence table);
  additive `risk_size_mult` field on `engine/cycles.ladder_state` (W2.8 artifact+fallback+one-time-log
  pattern; directional `LADDER_SCORE` UNTOUCHED — axis-flip is W4.7); `sector_central` consumes it as a
  capped, traced SIZE lever (inert at 1.0); `stance_matrix.json` cells carry backfilled vol-resid
  evidence (R3, no behavior change). BC-2: `scripts/check_validated_claims.py` + 166-entry justified
  allowlist — greps EN+zh+generated JS, HARD abort-lane step in `cycle-calibration.yml`; whole tree
  clean, selftest fires on synthetic EN+zh; NO unearned uses found (corpus was already disciplined).
  R1 containment: `cycle-calibration.yml` refit → diff-and-alert on any weight moving >10%. 17 W4.6
  tests + 125 cycle/sector_central/country regression tests green. Closes cycles-core-1,
  sector-central-us-5, doctrine #4/#5. Verdict: `research/cycle_masterplan/W46_BINDING_CALIBRATION_VERDICT.md`;
  PREREGISTRATION.md §4 results appended (criteria unmoved; A15).
- 2026-07-02 — Masterplan authored (14-agent design fleet + 4-agent red team; arbitration §1). Supporting
  docs committed under `research/cycle_masterplan/`.
- 2026-07-02 — **W0.2+W0.3 SHIPPED** (#913): `engine/cycle_forward_log.py`; US sector + country forward
  logs stamp for the first time (56+31 rows day-one) incl. `proj_lo/hi` cone edges; China grader
  basis-declared excess (`benchmark_close_price()`; NB: for the 000001.SS *index* TR≡price — the basis bug
  is real for ETF benchmarks only); engine-owned "read" primary, narrative demoted to dated Analyst note.
  36/36 tests.
- 2026-07-02 — **W0.1 SHIPPED** (#914): wall-clock TODAY on both flagships; `Math.max` push-forward
  deleted; elapsed turns render "window passed" chip + dimmed cone; staleness banners (amber 14d/red 60d);
  "Live read" → "Curated read".
- 2026-07-02 — **W0.4 SHIPPED** (#929): keystone gate run — verdict + re-steer in §6.5;
  `PREREGISTRATION.md` frozen (28 downstream gates with E[pass|null] + BH-FDR families);
  `data/research/keystone_tr0/` (basis:tr, epoch:tr_v0, research-only per ruling A1).
- 2026-07-02 — **W0.4 (keystone gate) SHIPPED.** TR-v0 PIT backfill (8,344 month-end stamps, 11 US sectors +
  24 country ETFs, 2005–2026) + walk-forward position/phase predictive-power study; PIT invariance verified.
  **VERDICT: position deciles = NO-EDGE (return channel); phase = risk-only, regime-fragile drawdown signal
  whose sign INVERTS the intuitive mapping (Peak→shallower DD, Trough→deeper); the LADDER inversion is NOT
  confirmed (INCONCLUSIVE on all 9 era×horizon cells).** Program steer (§6.1 branch): REFINE toward
  risk-lens + measurement + regime context; carry the hazard/conditional stack as a decision-gated research
  surface (DL-1/DL-2), NOT a v1 position-return sizing engine. Deliverables:
  `scripts/keystone_position_gate_phase0.py`, `research/cycle_masterplan/W04_KEYSTONE_VERDICT.md`,
  `research/cycle_masterplan/PREREGISTRATION.md` (all downstream gates + BH-FDR budget, frozen),
  `data/research/keystone_tr0/` (backfill + study tables). Runtime ~15–17 min.
- 2026-07-02 — **W1.2 SHIPPED** (#940): `engine/cycle_ontology.py` compiled contract + generated JS:
  `canonical_position()` (100·Φ(z)), `classify_phase()` with hysteresis, `detect_turns()` ZigZag v2
  with `confirmed_at` + NP-6 fix, `resolve_state()` full 5×8 crosswalk, `transition_signal()`,
  `match_turns()`, `project_next()` (§4.5 overdue semantics), `export_payload()`. 36 tests.
- 2026-07-02 — **W1.6 SHIPPED** (#946): resolve_state live in `_record_core` + `_project_next` overdue
  rewrite. `engine/sector_cycles._record_core` now emits `pos_v2` (canonical_position), `phase_v2` +
  `phase_v2_age_bars` (hysteresis-aware classify_phase), `stance`/`divergence`/`tone` (resolve_state) —
  all additive alongside byte-identical legacy fields. `_project_next` delegated to `onto.project_next`:
  central anchored at last confirmed turn (not TODAY); overdue cycles emit `overdue=True + overdue_frac`
  instead of silently walking forward; lo/hi band edges also anchored at last_confirmed + IQR_half.
  `cycle_forward_log` extended with 5 new columns (pos_v2, phase_v2, stance, divergence, overdue).
  17 new tests (tone→color guard A18, legacy byte-identity, overdue emission, no-forward-walking proof,
  lo/hi anchoring, hysteresis persistence, forward log schema + keep-FIRST). 67/67 relevant tests pass.
- 2026-07-02 — **W2.2 SHIPPED**: atomic price-basis flips for US sector_cycles + country_cycles.
  `cycles.analyze(price=)` structure-vs-momentum seam (ruling A13, D1-reviewed): structure math
  (cycle_state trough/DCL/failed-cycle + washout) reads `price` when supplied, momentum (MACD/StochRSI/RS)
  stays on the passed TR close; `price=None` is byte-identical to today (regression-tested).
  `sector_cycles._record_core` gains a `price=` param + a `basis` stamp (price/tr/tr_fallback, never
  silent); the 11 sector ETFs + 24 country + 7 aggregate ETFs flip their turns/osc/projection to
  close_price, RS stays TR; thematic + amalgam baskets stay member-TR (basis 'tr', out of W2.2 scope, not
  re-keyed). Ran `scripts/rekey_narratives.py` for real → `narratives.price_c4414dcb.json` +
  `cycle_dna.price_c4414dcb.json` for both engines (China spine EXEMPT per D4-N1 — Shenwan already
  price-basis — carried VERBATIM into `price_f224a71d`). Re-key: **sector** exact=875 shifted=4
  orphaned=12 (1.35%) new=17, max shift 94d (xli 2018-09→2018-12); **country** exact=247 shifted=12
  orphaned=7 (2.63%) new=296, max shift 68d (ilf). Archived tr_v0 forward logs →
  `forward_log.tr_v0.parquet` (single-date, zero-matured = nothing lost); writer now stamps a `basis`
  column and starts fresh price-epoch logs. `_narrative_epoch` guard now quarantines a flipped engine
  whose epoch file is missing (no silent stale-leg mis-bind). New `scripts/audit_price_basis.py` (D4 §6/§8:
  dual_basis_present, basis_preserving, no_tr_in_structure AST scan, golden_fixture XLU-flip proof,
  basis_homogeneous, narratives_versioned) wired into `run_quality_audits` as the 5th audit. 13 new tests
  (analyze byte-identity + split, basis stamping + tr_fallback labeling, audit passes-on-flip +
  fails-on-regression); W2.1 rekey tests updated to the post-flip contract. 30+13 tests pass.
- 2026-07-02 — **W1.1 SHIPPED** (#939): `engine/grading_stats.py` extracted (Wilson, date-blocked bootstrap,
  effective-n, FDR-BH, ONE cone_coverage @0.80, bar-i+1 guards, keep-FIRST reader); china grader refactored
  to import it, numerically identical. 80 tests.
- 2026-07-02 — **W1.3 SHIPPED** (#945): dual-basis store — `close_price` on 237/238 yahoo parquets (+4.4MB);
  invariance gate exact-PASS on all 4 asset classes; `yahoo_closes(basis=)`. Spec fixes: two-tier gate
  tolerance for dividend re-scaling; atomic column-inject (upsert path would corrupt).
- 2026-07-02 — **W1.5 SHIPPED** (#944): `cycle-calibration.yml` lane (own concurrency group) + 3 abort-lane
  ci gates (ontology-js drift, forward-log, grading-stats) + `OPS_GATES.md` (11-gate register; weekly-lane
  headroom ~25–40 min; D5 lead-lag must NOT land in pipeline-batch).
- 2026-07-02 — **W1.4 SHIPPED** (#950 + review #956): flagship/futures/FX/local-index collector adds +
  FRED deep seeds (CSUSHPISA 1987→, HOUST 1959→, DCOILWTICO 1986→, DHHNGSP 1997→). Review corrections:
  sanitizer filenames (PL_F/_SOX/USD*_X), +7-line config edit replacing a YAML round-trip, datetime indices.
- 2026-07-02 — **W2.1 SHIPPED** (#957): turn-epoch re-key migrator (`rekey_narratives.py` + epoch-aware
  loaders + rekey guard); byte-identity proven; 89.2% rebind on a simulated threshold flip. Spec gaps found:
  JS lookup keys stay date-form (turn_id travels inside legs); cycle_dna is legless; per-engine basket
  prefixes. Also fixed the ontology-js ci gate (missing numpy).
- 2026-07-02 — **W2.7 SHIPPED** (#959): business-cycle LORO recalibration — **3/3 in-sample → 2/3 OOS**
  (1990 missed; Jeffreys CI [0.18,0.96]; threshold −1.25→−1.0); ALFRED-vintage validation where covered;
  symmetric per-leg publication lags; causal cl_ratio; calibration-vs-config resolution guard.
- 2026-07-02 — **W2.6 SHIPPED** (#961): China pathway era-stabilized (composite defined only from
  all-legs-live 2019; composition_version stamped) + block-bootstrap CIs + causal pooled HARD gate.
  **All four sectors' h6 lift CIs straddle zero (consumption/auto flipped negative; n_eff≈1)**; pooled
  turn-signature evidence real (CI [0.23,0.46]). Central trace demoted validated→display.
- 2026-07-02 — **W2.8 SHIPPED** (#981): DC/IC bands FIT from measured trough spacing (equity (36,42)→
  (23,44) on 5,918 troughs; crypto (56,70)→(22,45)) and BIND via `cycle_bands_fit.json` with fallback;
  per-preset cand_depth; country RS asof re-slice + thin_history flag; China spine truncation guard.
- 2026-07-02 — **W3.1 SHIPPED** (#984): proxy registry (`engine/cycle_proxies.py`, bands schema; census
  17 measured-daily / 2 proxy / 1 monthly / 4 frame-only / 6 frame bands) + `record_series()` kernel
  (freq/invert/zz_abs/zz_standardize; _record_core = daily special case, byte-identical on all 3 engine
  pages). MU→DRAM 8/10 and CCJ→U₃O₈ 4/4 fitness PASS (low-confidence, timing-only). Bug fixed en route:
  business zz_abs must run on the z-scored series (41 junk turns → 8 real Kitchin turns).
- 2026-07-02 — **W2.3 SHIPPED** (#985): production PIT backfill — **12,519 monthly stamps** (sector 1,881 /
  country 5,738 / China 4,900; 2010–2026; 24.6 min; 6/6 PIT spot-checks; live logs untouched;
  engine_fingerprint stamped). Daily-ladder cadence deferred (runtime), documented.
- 2026-07-02 — **W2.5 SHIPPED** (#991): collinearity phase-0 — `state_score`×`pos_osc` ρ=−0.968 (VIF~30),
  state_score zero marginal info; 5 PCs = 91.2%; binding de-duplicated feature set for W4.2/W4.6;
  risk-channel survivors rs_63d + vol_pctile (CIs exclude 0). CL results appended to PREREGISTRATION.md.
- 2026-07-02 — **W2.4 SHIPPED** (#992): the three promise-graders + FIRST REAL SCORECARDS (§6.6).
  Independent realized-extrema turn truth (A6); BACKTEST/LIVE never blended; phase-appropriate horizons
  (N3); cone recal multipliers shipped; 9 accruing measurements registered (N4); graders wired into the
  calibration lane. CC-1/CC-2/CC-3 verdicts recorded against the frozen ledger.
- 2026-07-02 — **W3.2 SHIPPED** (#995): cycle.html ENGINE-BACKED — build_cycle.py is a real builder
  (`site/cycledata/cycle_engine.js`); MEASURED bands plot engine turns/osc/projections (hand cosine
  retired); FRAME bands render curated timeline + leg-length list (no scalar position, ruling A8); DUAL
  cards stack a secular strip; two-word MEASURED/FRAME badges + hover "how computed" (ruling A3); analyst
  prose demoted to dated OPINION overlay with hand-vs-engine delta notes. The audit's original page is no
  longer a drawing of an opinion.
- 2026-07-02 — **W3.6 SHIPPED**: ontology page adoption + cross-page consistency gate + phase-coherence
  fix. **PART A root cause (mixed vocabulary):** W1.6 fed the LEGACY range-stochastic `pos_now` into
  `onto.classify_phase` while emitting the canonical z/CDF `pos_v2` — so `phase_v2`'s LEVEL was derived
  from a *different* position than the record displayed. Because the two semantics genuinely disagree
  (range-stochastic reads washed-out where z/CDF reads stretched — the audit's core finding), records like
  EWU (`pos_v2=92.9`, `phase_v2='Trough'`) and EWC (`99.7`/`Trough`) carried a high position wearing a
  trough label; markets.html (W3.5) rendered exactly that contradiction. **Fix (kernel):**
  `engine/sector_cycles._record_core` now feeds `pos_v2` into BOTH `classify_phase` and `resolve_state`
  (falling back to `pos_now` only when the canonical read is unavailable) so the whole v2 triple
  (pos_v2 / phase_v2 / stance) is internally coherent; the LEGACY `phase`/`pos`/`signal` fields stay
  driven by `pos_now` and are byte-identical (verified: 0 legacy fields changed vs HEAD). EWU/EWC now read
  `Downturn` (a high position rolling over) — coherent. 8 forbidden records (3 sector + 5 country) → 0;
  cycle.html flagship went from 6 mixed-vocabulary bands (uranium `76/Trough`, etc.) to 0.
  **Coherence regression test** added (`tests/test_cycle_ontology.py`): no live record may carry
  `pos_v2 ≥ 85` with a Trough/Recovery `phase_v2` (nor the mirror) without a divergence flag; a synthetic
  EWU-pathology record is asserted to trip it. **PART B:** the shared `templates/sector_cycles.js` renders
  the resolved STANCE (tone-driven color via existing root tokens — bullish→--up, bearish→--down both
  zh-flip; caution/anticipatory/neutral flip-neutral, ruling A18) and the amber "clocks disagree"
  divergence chip (D1 §2.3) on all three engine pages (sector / country / china); DOM-verified incl. the
  zh flip; 0 contradictory badge pairs. **Cross-page consistency gate (R3-M3):**
  `scripts/check_cycle_consistency.py` asserts the same (ticker, basis) tape shows the same pos_v2/phase_v2
  across cycle.html / country_cycles / markets.html / sector (±2 pts, phase exact) OR carries a declared
  basis label; wired into `ci.yml`. Current build PASSES — 7 same-tape groups agree exactly (the EWx
  markets↔country ties, spread 0.00), 1 declared cross-tape difference (EEM etf_tr vs price, both labeled);
  report at `research/cycle_masterplan/W36_CONSISTENCY_REPORT.md`. Checker fails on a synthetic same-tape
  mismatch and on an undeclared cross-tape difference (tested).
- 2026-07-02 — **W3.8 SHIPPED** (#1003): frozen basket levels + membership hashes — 318 baskets frozen
  day-one (US 45 / CN 22 / THS 237 / HK 14); graders read frozen-only (live recompute deleted, proven by
  monkeypatch); hash-change = grade INVALIDATION; >15% truncation refuses to freeze + alerts; pre-freeze
  survivorship hole declared.

  bitcoin >$126k (the analyst's own ATH falsifier against the "shallow bear" card), corn >$5.75 sustained,
  platinum >$1,900** — three stale theses caught on day one.
- 2026-07-02 — **W3.5 SHIPPED** (#1004): markets.html re-pointed at the country engine (page identity kept
  per A9); posFromDrawdown + fake convergence bands DELETED. Honesty delta: China curated 68/Expansion →
  engine 8.6/Trough (−59.4); UK +24.9; India −24.5.
- 2026-07-02 — **W3.7 SHIPPED** (#1006): site/measurement.html — scorecards with red FAILED badges
  unsoftened, 24-gate prereg ledger, cone-recal cards, collinearity verdict, BACKTEST/LIVE discipline
  visible, provenance footer; nav guards green.
- 2026-07-02 — **W3.6 SHIPPED** (#1007): the pos-99-with-Trough contradiction diagnosed as MIXED
  VOCABULARIES (W1.6 fed legacy pos into the v2 phase classifier — the audit's disease resurfacing inside
  the fix); kernel now derives the whole v2 triple from one position; 8 forbidden records → 0; stance +
  "clocks disagree" chips on all pages; NEW cycle-consistency CI gate (same tape agrees cross-page or
  carries a declared basis label).
- 2026-07-02 — **W3.4 SHIPPED** (#1010): narrative TTL/staleness badges on 193 entries; 21 archetypes get
  LIVE mechanism checks (via the W3.3 evaluator — no second evaluator); tolerance report caught 8 live
