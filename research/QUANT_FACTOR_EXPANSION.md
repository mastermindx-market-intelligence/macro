# Quant-factor expansion — what firms use beyond technical & momentum, and what we can build free

Research dossier + feasibility matrix + build roadmap. Question that started it:
*"Outside technical and momentum indicators, what else do quantitative and
investment firms use — and which of it can we obtain and add to the dashboard?"*

> **UPDATE — integrated into the regime + sector recs (validate-gated).** The new
> factors are no longer just display/alerts; the validated ones now feed the
> classification and the exposure dial. Every change was re-validated against the
> 2007→2026 backtest (no degradation) or earns its place with a measured edge:
>
> - **Regime quad (engine/axes.py):** added real-time growth nowcasts — **Weekly
>   Economic Index** + **GDPNow** direction (growth axis) and **sticky-CPI**
>   direction (inflation axis), each weight 0.5 confirmations. Effect: whipsaw
>   **10.6% → 6.0%**, 2008 (Q4 72%) and the recession-tag (58%) unchanged, the
>   2022 Q2→Q3→Q4 path preserved, and covid's false-reflation days correctly
>   reclassified as the growth collapse. Absent pre-2008/2011 so deep history is
>   untouched (the axis renormalizes).
> - **Exposure dial (engine/playbook.py) → drives sector buy/sell posture:** two
>   new rules, each citing a MEASURED forward-return edge from the classifier's
>   own history (engine/playbook.risk_evidence):
>     - **Recession-risk composite HIGH** (Sahm + EBP + term-premium-adjusted
>       curve ≥ 50/100): S&P −0.88%/mo, 53% positive, −14.8% worst 3-mo drawdown
>       vs +1.11%/68%/−3.7% when low → −1 (often fires EARLIER than the price quad).
>     - **NFCI tight AND tightening:** 62% positive vs 68% loosening → −1.
> - **NOT wired (honesty):** RORO, equity VRP and the stock-bond correlation
>   regime showed **no equity-direction edge** over the backtest (risk-off
>   actually rebounds; the stock-bond "breakdown" regime had +1.39%/mo) — they
>   stay as risk/portfolio CONTEXT on the dashboard, not dial inputs. Sector
>   *selection* tilts are deliberately left out too: our backtest found no stable
>   "this sector outperforms" signal, so we don't fabricate one.

Method: 6 parallel web-research agents (one per factor family) against primary
sources — Fama-French, Novy-Marx, Frazzini-Pedersen (BAB), AQR (QMJ, Style
Premia), MSCI/BlackRock/Dimensional factor literature, and the Fed research
ecosystem — cross-referenced against a full audit of this repo's collectors and
engine so nothing already covered gets re-proposed. Verdicts below are graded
for THIS stack (free, static, daily, parquet-as-DB).

The headline finding: the dashboard already lives in the non-technical world
(credit OAS, breakevens, net liquidity, COT, dealer GEX, factor ETFs, on-chain
valuation, a commodity residual-shock engine). The gaps that are **free and
feasible** cluster in four places:

1. **The Fed research feed** — financial-conditions indices, growth/inflation
   nowcasts, recession-probability models, term premium, the Excess Bond
   Premium. All free on FRED/Fed-Board, all slot straight into the regime engine.
2. **Option-implied risk** — equity volatility-risk-premium, VIX term structure,
   the CBOE SKEW tail index. We do this for BTC (DVOL/VRP/skew) but not equities.
3. **Cross-sectional equity factors** — value/quality/profitability/investment/
   low-vol/BAB over the S&P 1500, buildable from **SEC EDGAR XBRL frames** (free,
   keyless) + the prices we already store. The one genuine new *feature*.
4. **Portfolio-construction overlays** — volatility targeting, drawdown control,
   realized-correlation regime, a Risk-On/Risk-Off composite. Pure compute on
   data we already hold.

## 1. The landscape — six families firms use outside price/momentum

### Family A — Cross-sectional equity factors (the "factor zoo")
The fundamental/balance-sheet/positioning factors behind smart-beta and quant
equity. **Value** (B/P, E/P, FCF yield, EV/EBITDA, S/P), **Quality &
profitability** (gross profitability `GP/Assets` — Novy-Marx; ROE; accruals —
Sloan; Piotroski F-score; AQR Quality-Minus-Junk), **Investment / asset growth**
(Fama-French CMA), **Low-volatility / Betting-Against-Beta** (Frazzini-Pedersen,
Sharpe ~0.78 1926-2012 ≈ 2× value), **Size** (quality-controlled — raw SMB
"basically disappeared" post-Banz), **Shareholder/buyback yield** (total payout
beats dividends-alone), **earnings revisions** (paid only), **short interest /
days-to-cover**.

Used by: Fama-French/Dimensional, AQR, Robeco, MSCI, BlackRock/iShares.
Key caveat across all of them: post-publication decay (~58%, McLean-Pontiff),
crowding, value's 2010s drawdown (intangibles break B/P), and look-ahead risk in
fundamentals (must lag to filing date).

### Family B — Multi-asset style premia & portfolio construction
The AQR "Style Premia" world. **Carry** in every asset class — FX (rate
differentials; Sharpe ~0.6-0.85 but negatively-skewed crash risk), bond/rates
carry + **term premium** + roll-down, **commodity carry / roll yield**
(backwardation earned ~7.7% vs 2.1% contango — the dominant long-run commodity
return driver), equity carry (dividend/earnings yield vs cash). **Cross-asset
value** (country CAPE, FX via REER, commodity 5y mean-reversion). **Defensive/BAB
across assets.** Portfolio construction: **risk parity / All-Weather (ERC),
volatility targeting** (Moreira-Muir: lifts Sharpe across factors), inverse-vol /
risk budgeting, **trend-following as crisis-alpha overlay** (positive in 8 of the
10 worst 60/40 drawdowns), drawdown control.

### Family C — Macro regime & nowcasting
Global-macro / Bridgewater-"economic-machine" toolkit. **Yield-curve recession
probability** (NY Fed probit on 10y-3m), **ACM term premium** (low/negative TP
mechanically inverts the curve WITHOUT signalling recession — the 2022-24 false
inversion), **Excess Bond Premium** (Gilchrist-Zakrajšek — credit-risk-appetite
orthogonal to fundamentals; forecasts activity AND asset prices), **Atlanta Fed
GDPNow** + **NY Fed/Dallas Weekly Economic Index** (real-time growth), **Cleveland
inflation nowcast + Atlanta sticky/flexible CPI** (persistent vs transitory
inflation), **Sahm rule** (concurrent labor recession confirm), **Financial
Conditions Indices** (Chicago Fed NFCI/ANFCI — 105 inputs in one z-score; Fed
Board FCI-G in growth units; St Louis/KC stress), global liquidity, a Risk-On/
Risk-Off correlation composite (KC Fed publishes one).

### Family D — Sentiment & positioning
COT **Index/percentile** normalization + the **disaggregated / TFF** reports
(dealer/asset-mgr/leveraged-fund detail vs the "blunt" legacy buckets), surveys
(NAAIM/UMich free; AAII blocked; Investors Intelligence & BofA FMS paid), options
sentiment (put/call, **CBOE SKEW**, VIX term structure, 25-delta risk reversal),
**short interest / days-to-cover** (FINRA, free), fund flows (money-market &
ICI free; EPFR/Lipper paid), **CTA / trend-follower positioning estimates**
(model-implied from price), Google Trends attention, NLP/news (RavenPack paid).

### Family E — Volatility & tail-risk premia
**Volatility/variance risk premium** (implied−realized; Bollerslev-Tauchen-Zhou),
**VIX term structure / vol carry**, **CBOE SKEW**, dispersion / implied-correlation
(partly paid), **realized correlation regime** (the 2022 stock-bond flip broke
60/40 and risk-parity together), **MOVE** (rates vol leads equity vol), vol
targeting, tail hedging / crisis alpha (Universa vs Israelov "pathetic
protection" debate — only deep-OTM continuously-rolled puts are convex).

### Family F — Alternative data
Satellite, card spend, web/app traffic, shipping/AIS — almost all vendor-only.
The free-and-obtainable slice: **EIA** petroleum/gas inventories (the single
biggest missing oil supply-shock driver per `COMMODITY_DATA_AUDIT`), **Baker
Hughes** rig count, **USDA** WASDE/NASS, **SEC EDGAR** Form-4 insider buys + 13F
institutional holdings (free, lagged — and the honest 45-day path to the
iShares/Vanguard holdings the daily feeds block), money-market/N-MFP. The rest
(satellite/card/AIS/RavenPack) is parked.

## 3. Build roadmap (tiers)

**Tier 1 — Fed-research feeds → regime engine (S, 🟢).** Almost pure config: add
the FRED series above (auto-collected by `FredAdapter`), one collector each for
EBP and CBOE SKEW, then wire into `engine/inputs.py` and a new
`engine/conditions.py`. New value: a Financial-Conditions index, real-time
growth/inflation nowcasts feeding the axes, a recession-risk panel
(Sahm+probit+EBP+TP-adjusted curve), and three alerts (NFCI tightening, Sahm
trigger, EBP spike). Fixes the documented 2022-24 false-inversion problem.

**Tier 2 — option-implied risk + portfolio overlays (M, 🟢).** `engine/conditions.py`
also computes Equity VRP, VIX term-structure regime, SKEW percentile, realized
stock-bond correlation regime, and a RORO composite; the playbook exposure dial
becomes volatility-scaled; COT readings get Index/percentile normalization.

**Tier 3 — cross-sectional equity factor engine (L, 🟢).** New `collectors/edgar.py`
(XBRL frames) + `engine/equity_factors.py` computing value/profitability/
investment/accruals/payout/low-vol/BAB ranks over the S&P 1500, a new
Factor-Rankings page, and a factor-leadership tile that enriches the
macro-regime → factor-appetite narrative. Per-stock factor scores flow into the
existing stock search / watchlist.

**Parked (⚫ paid/no):** earnings-revision breadth (I/B/E/S), EPFR/Lipper,
BofA FMS, Investors Intelligence, RavenPack NLP, retail order flow, full
options-dispersion history, AAII (403-blocked). Don't fake these.

House-rule discipline applies throughout: mechanical, backtestable, split-half
validatable, free, and graceful-degrading (every new leg renormalizes away if
its source is stale — the run never crashes). Each new factor ships with its
caveat (decay/crowding/look-ahead) the way the existing signals do.

## §6 Higher-quality-signal research (measured edges + the kill list)

After integrating the factors into the regime/dial, a 6-agent measurement sweep
asked "how else can this data give higher-quality signals?" — every claim
**measured** over 2007→2026 (weekly-decorrelated forward returns, split-half
checked). Two new signals cleared the bar and shipped; several intuitive ideas
**measured as fake** and are documented here so nobody rebuilds them.

### Built (real measured edge)
- **Macro-stress drawdown-risk gauge** (`engine/conditions.py drawdown_risk`,
  on macro.html): a LEAN 4-factor composite — recession-risk + NFCI + Excess Bond
  Premium + HY OAS (the curve & VIX legs were **dropped** because they tested
  weak/coincident). **RE-ISSUED (audit #39, 2026-07-02)** on the leak-free PIT
  ('release') frame with the LIVE jobless-**claims** composition (not the retired
  Sahm leg) by `scripts/validate_drawdown_risk_pit.py` →
  `data/regime/drawdown_risk_pit.json`. MEASURED, monotone by band (max-drawdown
  definition, matching the label): **~19% (base) → 11% (low) → 28% (elevated) → 36%
  (high) → 49% (extreme)**, 95% Wilson CIs, 1993–2026. The old table
  (`~8%→26%→36%→38%`) was measured on **latest-revised** data + the **Sahm**-era
  composition **and** implicitly on a point-to-point return (not the max-drawdown the
  label claims); it reproduced none of those. The re-issued table is stronger and
  cleaner. Honest framing: still a DRAWDOWN-RISK gauge, **not** a return forecast
  (risk-off rebounds) and **not** a clean recession leader (led in 2008, lagged
  2020/2022; credit-blind to a 2022-style rates bear). High/extreme bands are
  episode-driven (2008/2020/2022), so treat as a RISK read, not a crash oracle.
  Alert at the ≥80 crossing. The live gauge fires on the 'latest' frame; its bands sit
  within CI of the PIT numbers (extreme 51% latest vs 49% PIT).
- **Capitulation bounce gauge** (`engine/conditions.py capitulation`): counts how
  many of three panic signals fire — VRP percentile >0.90 (realized ≫ implied),
  VIX >30, COT spec washout (<10th pctile). MEASURED contrarian bounce: ≥1 signal
  → +4.5%/63d, 75% positive; ≥2 stacked → **+9.3%/63d, 86% positive** with
  *shallower* drawdowns (vs +2.8% base). Alert at ≥2. Fear, not forecast.

### Measured but NOT built (proposed for later, real edge)
- **Two-axis scenario odds**: conditioning forward-return odds on quad × NFCI
  direction splits the Q1/Q2 hit-rate 13–20pp (loosening ~72% vs tightening ~55%,
  holds in both sample halves) — already captured in the dial's NFCI rule; a
  fuller scenario-odds panel is a medium-effort follow-up. **Do NOT** build the
  full 24-cell quad × recession-band × NFCI grid: only ~8 of 24 cells exceed N=50.
- **Value-vs-Growth tilt**: yield-rising → value (t=+3.0, holds in all four
  sub-periods 2000→2026); Q1→value / Q4→growth (~1.9% spread). A low-effort tile
  for factors.html.

### KILL LIST — measured anti-signals (do NOT build)
- **"Rotate to low-vol/quality when conditions tighten / recession-risk rises" is
  BACKWARDS.** USMV/SPLV *under*perform when NFCI tightens (rel −1.0%/−0.75%,
  t<−2.7) and high-beta SPHB *out*performs (+1.28%) — because risk-off rebounds.
  Defensive factors only help on a *drawdown* basis, not return. (Consistent with
  the dial's existing "risk-off rebounds, drawdowns deepen" note.)
- **Multi-signal stock conviction screen — do not build a ranked buy-list.** The
  cross-sectional factor composite's forward IC is **negative** (−0.05 to −0.11,
  t −5 to −15) on the current universe, and the short-interest "edge" is **size in
  disguise** (IC collapses to ~0 after size-neutralization, flips sign across
  halves). Also fatally look-ahead-biased: only one short-interest settlement date
  + a snapshot of fundamentals exist. factors.html stays **descriptive**, not a
  buy-list, until dated point-in-time snapshots accumulate.
- **EIA "tight crude stocks = bullish oil/energy" is BACKWARDS** — tight stocks
  precede *worse* forward oil returns (draws follow price runs). **Oil COT
  positioning** is flat (no edge). **VIX term-structure backwardation** and **CBOE
  SKEW extremes** ≈ base rate (SKEW>0.90 gives +2.4%/63d = base). **Commodity
  carry** as a signal is deferred — only ~1.5y of history exists.
- **Don't make the drawdown gauge a "leader"** or add net-liquidity to it
  (net-liquidity-falling drawdown prob 8% < 13% base = anti-signal).
