# D0R Workstream G — Golden universe, themes, programs, and adversarial cases

This set is the acceptance cohort for D1–D17. It cannot be silently swapped to make a wave pass. Coverage gaps below are live as of entitled capture 2026-08-17 (evidence cut 2026-08-13, graph defense19-v1).

Issuers counted (unique **live US + international research names**, SPR excluded from live set): LMT, RTX, NOC, GD, HII, BA, LHX, TDG, HWM, IRDM, LDOS, CACI, SAIC, BWXT, GE, HON, TXT, HEI, AVAV, KTOS, MRCY, VSAT, BAESY, RHM, SAAB, HO.PA, LDO, 012450.KS, PLTR, AXON, MP = **31 live + SPR historical**. Still ≥30.

## G1b. Stock Identity validation (universe_snapshot_v1, asof 2026-08-13)

Command: `pandas.read_parquet` on `git show HEAD:data/stock_identity/partition/universe_snapshot_v1.parquet` (2781 symbols). Columns used: `symbol`, `last_date`, `tape_ended`, `terminated_reason`, `compute_eligible`.

| Ticker | In SI universe | tape_ended | compute_eligible | last_date | Ruling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| LMT RTX NOC GD HII BA LHX TDG HWM IRDM LDOS BWXT GE HON TXT HEI AVAV KTOS MRCY VSAT PLTR AXON MP | yes | false | true | 2026-08-13 | **Live US golden** |
| GEV | yes (GE split sibling) | false | true | 2026-08-13 | Keep as identity/M&A evidence; not a G1 replacement for GE |
| **SPR** | **no row** | — | — | — | **Not a live issuer.** Boeing completed Spirit acquisition **2025-12-08** (Boeing 8-K `https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/12927/000162828025055825/ba-20251208.htm`; Spirit 8-K `https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364885/000110465925119096/tm2532915d1_8k.htm` — NYSE halt before open 2025-12-08). `config/us_search_aliases_zh.json` still maps SPR — alias only, not a tape. |
| **CACI, SAIC** | **no row** | — | — | — | Still golden *research* names (services archetype). Coverage gap: not in this US SI snapshot. D2 must resolve share-class / listing before any candidate. |
| BAESY, BAE, RHM, SAAB, HO, LDO, 012450, EADSY, RNMBY | **no row** | — | — | — | International / ADR not on this US SI plane. Keep as archetype 11 research names; do not mint `central:BAESY` here. Local listings (BA.L, RHM.DE, SAAB-B.ST, HO.PA, LDO.MI, 012450.KS) are **not** in the US snapshot. |

Authority flags on the snapshot (`authority_*`) are all false — SI is identity, not rank/gate.

Include at least: mega/large/mid/small; US+international; prime+supplier; pure+diversified; profit+growth; FP development (BA/NOC Sentinel); services+product; strong identity (IRDM) and weak (filmstrip extras); JV/M&A (L3Harris-Aerojet as related; GE split); dual-class/cross-list (BAESY ADR vs London).

## G2. Golden themes (10) — first three war rooms starred

1. **Golden Dome / layered homeland missile defense** *  
2. **Missiles, interceptors, munitions, replenishment** *  
3. **NATO / European rearmament and local content** *  
4. FMS / export demand  
5. Fleet upgrade and sustainment  
6. Proliferated space architecture  
7. Autonomy / drones / c-UAS  
8. Shipbuilding / submarine / AUKUS  
9. Nuclear modernization  
10. Industrial bottlenecks / critical materials  

First implementation war rooms: **1, 2, 8** if D1 rescue is US tape-first; **2, 3, 8** if NATO names are in the identity graph. Default: **2, 8, 6** (munitions, shipbuilding, space) because the live tape already has IRDM space-service and HII ship late-discovery. Revisit after D2 Atlas.

## G3. Golden programs / platforms (≥15)

## G4. Adversarial states (must appear in D1+ UX)

| State | Live exemplar |
|---|---|
| Award ceiling with low/no funding | IDIQ pattern (LHX-class); not IRDM P00032 |
| Routine option already expected | E56 family; title must not say “new franchise” |
| Unresolved recipient | mapping-backlog **21** on entitled API |
| Historical ownership change | GE split; L3Harris-Aerojet |
| JV uncertain economics | D2 Atlas; none on IRDM path |
| FMS notification not yet sale | G2 theme 4 / E08 E60 |
| Budget request not appropriated | Budget tab **PROJECTION_MISSING** |
| Positive demand, negative FP economics | KC-46, Sentinel, Constellation |
| Large backlog, capacity bottleneck | munitions/ship |
| Legal settlement immaterial | E54 |
| Legal/compliance structural | ITAR/export E55 |
| Program charge contained vs recurring | BA tanker series |
| Theme rally, no issuer alpha | Golden Dome discourse E38 |
| Selloff before event known | options/attention |
| **Late collector discovery** | **IRDM P00032 known_at Aug vs action May** |
| Corrected source | action-version successor |
| Classified/undisclosed economics | B-21 / E63 |
| Missing historical estimate/price vintage | all H-* until PIT store |
| Rights-blocked source | Janes/Govini; Radar **UI lock** despite 200 |
| Sign-in vs hydrate split | entitled cookie 200 + Radar overlay membership |

## G5. Freeze

Do not replace IRDM or HII late-discovery as the D1 clock/identity cases. Do not drop international names solely because the US tape is the current substrate. **Do not treat SPR as a live golden ticker.** Use it only as M&A/identity history (E67). `config/us_search_aliases_zh.json` SPR alias is not Stock Identity membership.
