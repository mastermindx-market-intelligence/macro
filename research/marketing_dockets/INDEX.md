# Marketing Rollout Dockets — Master Index

**Author:** Fable (main loop), 2026-07-19. **Purpose:** the Marketing lobe's content stack is built; the rest of the org is chartered scaffolding. Each docket below is a self-contained writeup that a **fresh session can execute cold** — hand one docket to one session. Read this index + the docket + `CLAUDE.md` before building anything.

**Distribution-first acquisition authority:** when the goal is the fastest credible path from zero audience to the first 1,000 qualified leads, read `research/MARKETING_FASTEST_PATH_TO_FIRST_1000_QUALIFIED_LEADS_FOR_FABLE.md` and its named target book, `research/marketing_dockets/MKT_FIRST_1000_DISTRIBUTION_TARGETS.md`. They override generic channel emphasis, not docket build status or standing platform rules; they do not impose an arbitrary one-week deadline.

## 1. State of the lobe (what is BUILT — do not rebuild)

| Capability | Receipts (merged PRs) | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Growth-OS substrate: 11 depts, G0–G7 authority ladder, CMO self-improve loop, governor, contracts | #2916 #2926 | `engine/marketing/` (departments, cmo, authority, state, publication, economics, ledgers, claims, provenance, charter, events, experiments, opportunity_bus, campaign_compiler), `config/marketing.yml`, `scripts/build_marketing.py`, daily.yml step ~L2721 |
| Admin cockpit: legible per-dept + per-engine pages, short dept names | #2926 #2950 | `admin/marketing.py`, `admin/server.py`, `admin/nw_lobe_descriptions.py` |
| Content Studio: mixed-tilt 6-account plan, live-signal gate, stub-strip | #2950 #2961 #2994 | `engine/marketing/content_studio.py` → `data/marketing/content_plan.json` |
| Copywriter: 6 personas, `validate_copy`, deterministic floor + **LLM ceiling** (llm_auth waterfall, double-guarded) | #2994 #3032 | `engine/marketing/copywriter.py`, `config/marketing.yml copywriter:`, `config.yml llm_models.marketing_copy` |
| Chart engine v2/v3: candles, ticker logomarks, MACD/VOL panels, SETUP highlight, CTA footer ("free 14-day trial · mastermind-x.com") | #2994 #3003 | `engine/marketing/chart_render.py`, `logo_cache.py` |
| Facts engines: chart facts, macro/sector/breadth facts, graded receipts, earnings cards | #2994 #3003 | `chart_facts.py`, `market_facts.py`, `receipt_source.py`, `earnings_card.py` |
| Momentum cross signals: weekly MACD+RSI, weekly/biweekly StochRSI | #2971 | `engine/momentum_events.py` |
| Confluence miner → win-rate hooks in posts | #2994 | `engine/tech_confluence.py`, `engine/tech_catalog.py`, `site/tech_lab.html#combos`, `engine/marketing/confluence_source.py` |
| Movers/Attention Desk: multi-cashtag theme lists, round-robin reach injection | #3020 | `engine/marketing/movers_source.py` |
| Beacon (seo_organics): ~1,500 SEO ticker dossiers | #2980 #3000 #3017 | `templates/` + engine-internal render |

Department roster (`engine/marketing/departments.py`): **Command** (office_cmo), **Engine Room** (growth_os, the only one `building`), **Radar** (intelligence), **Workshop** (products), **Studio**, **Broadcast** (distribution), **Funnel** (lifecycle), **Allies** (ecosystem), **Lab** (growth_science), **Sentinel** (trust_office), **Beacon** (seo_organics). Everything except Engine Room + the Studio-adjacent content stack + Beacon's dossiers is **chartered, not built**.

Strategy corpus (read the one your docket cites): `research/MARKETING_FASTEST_PATH_TO_FIRST_1000_QUALIFIED_LEADS_FOR_FABLE.md`, `research/NEURAL_WEB_AUTONOMOUS_MARKETING_LOBE_GRANDMASTER_PLAN_FOR_FABLE.md`, `MARKETING_LOBE_GUERRILLA_GROWTH_AND_OPERATIONS_BY_FABLE.md`, `MARKETING_TRENDSPIDER_PLAYBOOK_AND_CHART_ENGINE_BY_FABLE.md`, `MARKETING_REALTIME_FASTLANE_ARCHITECTURE_BY_FABLE.md`, `MARKETING_ZERO_FOLLOWER_TRACTION_PLAYBOOK_BY_FABLE.md`, `TRENDSPIDER_GROWTH_SEO_AND_GUERRILLA_MARKETING_INTELLIGENCE_FOR_FABLE.md`.

D11's recommended affiliate economics, dated Founding 20 offer, product-native attribution loop, and implementation packets are canonical in [`D11_AFFILIATE_CREATOR_PROGRAM_SHAPE_RULING.md`](D11_AFFILIATE_CREATOR_PROGRAM_SHAPE_RULING.md). It is a recommendation until the operator ratifies its seven decisions; it does not authorize outreach or payouts.

## 2. Docket table

**Sequencing:** D08 → D02(W0) → D01(W0) unlocks launch the moment the operator provides accounts + host. D04/D05/D09 fatten content quality in parallel. D03 turns on the learning loop once posts are live. D06/D07 make the CMO loop real. D10/D11 are later waves.

## 3. Standing laws for EVERY marketing session (non-negotiable)

1. **Read first:** `CLAUDE.md` (from origin/main, not a stale worktree copy), this index, your docket, `docs/ACTIVE_BUILD_MAP.md` (collisions), `research/DO_NOT_REBUILD.md`.
2. **Model routing (healed 2026-07-25 to the 07-21 Opus build lane):** Opus `builder` agents build code (Sonnet no longer writes shipping code — census/exploration only); Opus `reviewer` reviews; user-facing surfaces (admin pages count) go through the `designer` agent or main loop — **never sonnet designs or builds**. Tell every builder explicitly: **NO GIT COMMANDS** — builders have self-created and self-merged PRs twice in this program. Audit `git log` after every builder lane.
3. **Git:** fresh branch off `origin/main`; finish the full chain same-day: commit → push → PR → `gh pr merge <n> --squash --delete-branch --admin`. Never reuse a squash-merged branch. Never bare `git stash`.
4. **Verify the artifact, not the code:** after ANY `content_studio.py` / pipeline edit, run the builder and inspect `data/marketing/content_plan.json` — fail-soft catches have silently killed charts before. Local runs of site builders touch many files: restore everything except your target.
5. **Copy discipline:** every user-visible post text passes `validate_copy` (numbers whitelist, banned vocab, cashtags, invalidation disclosure). Never post an invalidated/stale/underwater signal — `is_postable_signal` + `verify_signal_live` are law (the QCOM incident). Confluence win-rate hooks and movers/theme-list copy are kept verbatim — don't route them through rewrite.
6. **Epistemics:** the lobe is **display-tier, off the scored path**. LLMs never originate signals/scores — copy voice only, over deterministic facts. "Validated" in user-facing text is CI-enforced.
7. **Render budget:** heavy compute (per-ticker sweeps, profile calcs, LLM calls) goes off the nightly render path or is cached/gated. The nightly is ~67 min, 4-core-bound, and is the sole advancer of forward ledgers; intraday lanes must not advance ledgers or commit data/.
8. **Secrets:** credentials never enter the repo. Env + runner secrets only (the CXI credential sweep pattern).
9. **When done:** update `~/.claude/.../memory/marketing-lobe-genesis.md` (append a round line) and mark the docket's status line in this index via a PR.

## 4. Delegation prompt template

> Read `research/marketing_dockets/INDEX.md` and `research/marketing_dockets/<DOCKET>.md` in this repo, plus `CLAUDE.md`. Execute the docket's next unbuilt wave end-to-end: build with **opus** `builder` agents (NO GIT for builders), review with opus `reviewer`, design surfaces with the designer agent, verify the acceptance criteria, then finish the full git chain (branch off fresh origin/main → PR → same-day squash-merge). Update the docket status line + memory when merged.
