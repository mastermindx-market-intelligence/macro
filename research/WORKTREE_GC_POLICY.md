# Worktree GC policy — fleet session-checkout sweeper

**Status: PROPOSED — awaiting operator ratification. Nothing has been deleted.**
Tool: `scripts/worktree_gc.py` (shipped disarmed: `config/worktree_gc.json` → `"armed": false`).

## §0 Ratification box (operator decisions)

| # | Decision | Default shipped | Operator act | Measured effect today |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Arm deletion of `SAFE_MERGED` + `SAFE_REMOTE` and set `min_age_days` — **recommend 2** (3 = conservative, 7 = insurance-only) | disarmed, 7 d | flip `"armed": true` + set `"min_age_days"` in `config/worktree_gc.json` (one-line PR) | at 2 d: **51.3 GiB** now + caps the leak tail forever; at 7 d: ~0 today (nothing unpinned survives 7 d — see §5) |
| R2 | Install the daily launchd sweeper on the Studio | not installed | `bash scripts/install_worktree_gc_launchd.sh` on the Studio | keeps the tail drained daily |
| R3 | Same for the M1 host when it returns (unreachable at audit time, runners offline) | not installed | same installer over ssh; feed `--pr-states-file` if gh is unauthenticated there | unknown until reachable |
| R4 | Reclaim `ORPHAN` husks (unregistered dirs under the roots) | off | `"include_orphans": true` | ~0 GiB (4 empty husks) |
| R5 | Reclaim clean+pushed worktrees of OPEN PRs (branch/PR survive; only the local checkout goes) | off | `"include_open_pr": true` | small; open lanes are mostly RECENT anyway |
| R6 | charting-app: same sweep for its 103 GiB `.claude/worktrees` | report-only | arm a `config/worktree_gc.json` there (tool takes `--repo-root`) | **9.6 GiB** at 7 d already (16 trees); more at 2 d |
| R7 | Session-closing hygiene: **24 open sessions / 78.1 GiB** have their PR already squash-merged at the worktree head but stay pinned by their processes. Closing finished sessions releases them to the sweeper (all 62 pinned trees are < 2 d strong-active, so this is workflow, not archaeology) | keep all pinned | close finished sessions in FleetView as a habit | ~78 GiB now; keeps the done-pool draining |
| R8 | Structural: each checkout is 3.27 GiB, of which `data/` 2.10 + `site/` 0.67 = **85 %**. The ~0–2 d active window (~330 GiB at the measured ~40 sessions/day cadence) is a capacity requirement GC cannot reduce — a sparse-checkout session profile could cut it ~5×. **SHIPPED 2026-08-13** (operator-ratified during the disk-pressure incident) | sparse by default | `config/sparse_worktree.json` → `"enabled": false` reverts to full checkouts | ~7–11× per tree; see §8 |

First armed run on the Studio: suggest `--apply --dry-run` once, eyeball the log, then `--apply`.
`max_delete_per_run: 200` caps a single pass; the daily schedule drains any remainder.

## 1. The problem (measured 2026-08-05, Studio)

Disk at **96 %** (1.7 Ti / 1.8 Ti, 89 Gi free). The fleet worktree roots hold:

| Root | Entries | Size |
|---|---:|---:|
| Macro `.claude/worktrees/` | 186 dirs (217 registrations repo-wide) | **597.5 GiB** |
| Macro `.codex-worktrees/` | 13 | 37.0 GiB |
| `~/.codex/worktrees/` (legacy home root) | 14 | 34.4 GiB |
| Macro `.claire/worktrees/` | 3 husks | ~0 |
| charting-app `.claude/worktrees/` | 130 | 103.3 GiB |
| **Fleet sprawl total** | | **≈ 772 GiB** |

**Corrected model (what the audit actually found):** this is *not* months of quiet
accumulation. The harness already recycles most closed sessions (at the measured
cadence of ~40 session worktrees/day, two months of pure leakage would be ~2,400
trees — only 186 exist). The pile decomposes into three different problems:

1. **The active window** — ~132 unpinned trees / ~417 GiB with strong activity
   < 3 d, plus 62 process-pinned trees / 203 GiB that are ALL < 2 d strong-active
   too (49 carry a live `claude` process). Fleet cadence × 3.27 GiB per checkout.
   GC cannot shrink the genuinely-working part; only R8 can.
2. **The done-but-still-here pool** — sessions whose PR is already squash-merged
   at exactly the worktree head: **64 idle trees / 201.4 GiB** (aging toward the
   min_age bar; 17 / 51.3 GiB past 2 d today) plus **24 still-open trees /
   78.1 GiB** whose processes pin them until the session is closed (→ R7).
   This ~280 GiB pool is what the sweeper + session hygiene continuously drain.
3. **The leak tail** — 4 DIRTY trees / 8.7 GiB idle 7–60 d holding uncommitted
   files (operator-review pile, listed in the report; never auto-deleted).

A typical checkout is 3.27 GiB: `data/` 2.10 + `site/` 0.67 (85 %) + code.
The M1 runner host (mac-builder-1/2/3) hit **ENOSPC 2026-08-04**, killing the
runner Worker mid-collect (run 30960328285) and severing the nightly collection
lane; it likely carries its own mix of the same three piles plus runner `_work`
churn. As of this audit the M1 is unreachable over ssh (Tailscale timeout) and
its three runners are offline; Studio spares mac-builder-4/5 are online carrying
the load.

## 2. Safety model (what "provably safe to remove" means)

Deleting a worktree directory can lose exactly two things: **uncommitted files** and
**commits reachable only from its local branch**. The branch ref itself lives in the
shared `.git` and is deleted only under its own proof. So a worktree is safe iff it is
**not in use** and **holds no unique content**:

**Liveness (all must clear):**
- No `git worktree lock` (sessions annotate locks with pid — honored unconditionally).
- No process with cwd inside (one global `lsof -d cwd` pass; never per-tree `+D` descents over 600 GiB).
- No STRONG activity within `min_age_days` (7 d). Strong = the last reflog **entry's embedded
  epoch** (real HEAD movement) and the harness session dir `~/.claude/projects/<path-slug>/`
  newest mtime. File mtimes are recorded but never gate — the audit caught two systematic
  stampers that would otherwise hold the gate shut forever: a repo-global `reflog expire`
  rewrote all 186 trees' `logs/HEAD` at 2026-08-04 15:38:24 (every dead tree read "0.2 d
  old"), and observer sweeps (`git status` from dashboards writes the index; Finder drops
  `.DS_Store`) kept 137/143 dead trees under 2 d by index/HEAD/dir mtimes while their
  reflog entries and transcripts sat weeks old. House law is same-day merge; 7 d without
  ref movement or transcript writes is dead by a wide margin — and the content proofs
  below, not the age gate, are the actual loss-prevention layer.

**Content (any one proof suffices):**
- `HEAD` is an **ancestor of `origin/main`** — nothing unique by construction; or
- a **MERGED PR exists whose `headRefOid` equals `HEAD` exactly** — squash-merge proof.
  Ancestry cannot see squashes and `delete_branch_on_merge=true` erases the remote branch,
  so PR state (via `gh pr list`, 3 quota-cheap calls) is the only sound proof here.
  Oid-exact matching means a head that moved past the merged commit stays kept; or
- `HEAD` is **contained in a still-existing origin branch** and **no PR is open** for it
  (`SAFE_REMOTE`: the checkout is a cache; content survives on the remote).

**Fail-closed everywhere:** any probe error/timeout, unreadable config, missing PR data,
stale remote refs after a failed `git fetch --prune`, or an unavailable lsof scan ⇒ KEEP
(and apply mode refuses outright without liveness data). Verdicts for kept trees:
`LOCKED / LIVE_PROC / RECENT / DIRTY / OPEN_PR / UNPUSHED / ERROR / ORPHAN`.

**Never candidates:** the primary checkout, the sweeper's own cwd, anything outside the
configured roots (`~/hub-ops-wt`, `/private/tmp` scratch registrations are out of scope;
dead registrations get `git worktree prune`d, which is metadata-only).

## 3. Mechanism

`git worktree remove --force` from the primary root (our proofs are stricter than git's;
`--force` only clears gitignored build junk objections), then one `git worktree prune`.
Local branch `git branch -D` **only** when the merge proof held and the branch tip still
equals the proven head. `ORPHAN` husks (dir without registration — git cannot status them)
use `rm -rf` and are **off by default** (R4). Every deletion appends a JSONL row
(path/branch/head/size/verdict/proof) to `~/Library/Logs/macro_worktree_gc/ledger.jsonl`.

## 4. Scheduling: launchd per host, not a repo workflow

The failure mode this tool exists for — disk full — **takes the host's own runners
offline** (that is how the M1 died), so a runner-scheduled workflow can never save the
host that needs it. GitHub cron also delivers ~15 % of slots in this repo. Hence
per-host launchd (`scripts/worktree_gc.launchd.plist` via the installer, daily 05:17
local, `Nice 15`, logs under `~/Library/Logs/macro_worktree_gc/`). Installing before R1
is safe: apply self-gates to report-only while disarmed. `scripts/metabolism_gc.py`
(wf_* autonomy-loop trees, journal-based proofs) stays as is — different scope; its
inverted ancestry check is flagged separately.

## 5. Measured classification & reclaim estimate (Studio, 2026-08-05)

Receipts: `research/worktree_gc/2026-08-05_studio_*.{md,json}` (full per-tree verdicts).

**Macro root** (186 trees + husks; shipped default min_age 7 d; verdicts stable across
three audit passes):

| verdict | count | GiB | note |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| RECENT | 143 | 450.6 | strong activity < 7 d (histogram below) |
| LIVE_PROC | 62 | 203.0 | all < 2 d strong-active; 49 with live `claude` proc |
| DIRTY | 4 | 8.7 | idle 7–60 d, uncommitted files — operator-review pile |
| LOCKED | 1 | 3.3 | `x-growth-overhaul`, session lock honored |
| ORPHAN / SELF / MISSING | 4 / 1 / 1 | ~0 | husks; metadata prune only |
| **SAFE now (7 d)** | **0** | **0.0** | nothing unpinned survives 7 d — see below |

Strong-age histogram of unpinned trees (count / GiB): <1 d 36/117 · 1–2 d 68/215 ·
2–3 d 28/85 · 3–5 d 7/22 · 5–7 d 4/12 · ≥7 d 4/8.7 (the DIRTY pile).

**Why 7 d reclaims zero here and why that is not failure:** the harness already
recycles most closed sessions; what remains is the live fleet plus the done-pool.
The done-pool is real and measured — **64 idle trees / 201.4 GiB are oid-exact
squash-merged** (of which 17 / **51.3 GiB** already ≥ 2 d idle) and **24 pinned
trees / 78.1 GiB** more are merged but still open. R1 at min_age 2 d harvests the
idle half continuously; R7 releases the pinned half.

**charting-app root** (130 trees, min_age 7 d): SAFE_MERGED 14 + SAFE_REMOTE 2 =
**9.6 GiB reclaimable immediately**; RECENT 93 / 76.6 GiB; DIRTY 19 / 9.7 GiB;
UNPUSHED 14 / 7.1 GiB; LIVE_PROC 4. A smaller, older fleet → a genuine dead tail;
validates every verdict class on a second repo.

**Detector integrity (why the first two audit passes were discarded):** pass 1
read all trees "0.2 d old" — a repo-global `reflog expire` had stamped every
`logs/HEAD` file at 2026-08-04 15:38:24; pass 2 still read 137/143 "fresh" off
index/HEAD/dir file mtimes written by observer sweeps (`git status` from
dashboards, Finder `.DS_Store`). Both stampers are now regression-pinned in
`tests/test_worktree_gc.py`; the shipped probe gates on reflog ENTRY epochs +
session transcript mtimes only.

## 6. M1 plan (R3)

When reachable: `scp scripts/worktree_gc.py m1:` and run `--report --repo-root <primary>`
with `--pr-states-file pr_states_macro.json` (map emitted on the Studio) if `gh` is not
authenticated there — offline hosts consume Studio-fetched PR proofs; a failed fetch
marks remote refs stale and `SAFE_REMOTE` fails closed, but merged-PR and
ancestor-of-last-known-main proofs (both under-approve, never over-approve) still land.
If its disk is still wedged at 100 %, the report run needs no free space to speak of;
present its numbers, then arm.

## 7. Explicitly out of scope (v1)

- `git gc` / repack of the shared 29 GiB `.git` (concurrent-session risk; separate ask).
- Runner `_work` directories (bounded per-workflow reuse; separate lever).
- Killing processes that pin `LIVE_PROC` trees — the sweeper only reports them (R7 is
  operator hygiene; a rule change would be its own ratified PR).
- Shrinking the active window — a capacity question, not GC. Shipped separately as the
  sparse session profile (§8), which is the only lever that reaches the active window.
- Steady state with R1 armed at 2 d ≈ active window (~330 GiB) + parked pile until R7
  acted on. The tail no longer grows; the window tracks fleet cadence.

## §8. Sparse session-worktree profile (R8 — shipped 2026-08-13)

Operator-ratified during the same disk-pressure incident that armed the sweeper.
GC reclaims FINISHED trees; this shrinks LIVE ones, which is why both were needed.

**Claude mechanism.** `.claude/hooks/worktree_create_sparse.py` runs on the
harness's `WorktreeCreate` event, wired in the checked-in
`.claude/settings.json`. It fetches
`origin/main`, adds the worktree `--no-checkout`, sets a cone-mode sparse profile
holding every tracked top-level directory except those in
`config/sparse_worktree.json`, then `read-tree -mu HEAD` to populate it. A name of
the form `pr-<N>` bases the tree on that PR's head instead. It replaces an
unversioned zsh prototype that lived in `~/.local/bin` and was wired through
`.claude/settings.local.json` — globally gitignored, so the behaviour existed on one
host but could never ship, be reviewed, or be tested.

**Codex mechanism (shipped 2026-08-15).** The default local environment at
`.codex/environments/environment.toml` runs `python3
scripts/worktree_sparse.py auto` when Codex creates a worktree. The checked-in
`.codex/hooks.json` `SessionStart` hook is the fallback when no environment was
selected. `auto` refuses the primary checkout, honors the same profile and off
switch, and preserves any existing sparse selection so a session's explicit
`add site` is not undone. Codex requires one-time trust for a new or changed
project-local hook definition. Current Codex lifecycle events are post-checkout,
not a pre-checkout replacement for Claude's `WorktreeCreate`: the steady-state
tree reaches the same 0.35–0.57 GiB, while initial creation may transiently write
the full checkout before the setup removes the excluded paths.

**Cursor IDE mechanism (shipped 2026-08-15).** Cursor has no pre-checkout
`WorktreeCreate`. `.cursor/hooks.json` runs `python3 scripts/worktree_sparse.py
auto` on `sessionStart` and `workspaceOpen`. `auto` converts only a linked
worktree under a session root (`.claude/worktrees/` and siblings). That extra
path check exists because the operator's designated local project root is
itself a linked worktree of the occupied primary — a SessionStart hook keyed
only on `git-dir != common-dir` would sparsify that 3.8 GiB tree on every
Cursor chat.

**Cursor CLI + Grok mechanism (shipped 2026-08-15; AionUi mint 2026-08-18).**
Cursor CLI / Agents Window runs `.cursor/worktrees.json` `setup-worktree-unix`
after it creates the worktree. Grok Build runs
`.grok/hooks/session_start_sparse.py` on `SessionStart` (unknown Claude events
such as `WorktreeCreate` are skipped). When the session already sits in a
linked session worktree the hook calls `python3 scripts/worktree_sparse.py
auto`, sharing the post-checkout thinning, session-root refusal, and "do not
re-apply over an existing sparse selection" rule. AionUi launches Grok in an
empty `~/.aionui/conversations/.../grok-temp-*` directory that is not a git
worktree, so the project hook never loads; the always-trusted
`~/.grok/hooks/` copy of the same script mints a sparse tree under
`.grok/worktrees/<name>/` with `git worktree add --no-checkout` (Claude's
pre-checkout shape) and writes `.session-worktree` in the temp dir. Grok
project hooks still need one-time `/hooks-trust`. `--worktree` / `-w` still
bases on current HEAD unless the session passes `--ref origin/main` (Grok) or
`--worktree-base origin/main` (Cursor).

**Warp/Oz mechanism (shipped 2026-08-22).** Warp has no SessionStart or
`WorktreeCreate` event. `.warp/hooks/session_start_sparse.py` is the mint;
`.agents/skills/macro-sparse-worktree` is how a Warp session discovers it and
must run it before editing. If the session already sits in a linked session
worktree the hook calls `python3 scripts/worktree_sparse.py auto`. Otherwise it
mints under `.warp/worktrees/<name>/` with `git worktree add --no-checkout`
(Claude's pre-checkout shape) and prints `WORKSPACE=<path>`. It never sparsifies
the occupied primary or the operator local root, and it never writes
`.session-worktree` into a git checkout.

**Host migration (one operator step, AFTER this merges).** The Studio's legacy wiring
was deliberately left alone by the shipping session: repointing it before the merge
would have aimed it at a script not yet on `main` and broken worktree creation for
the whole fleet. Once merged, remove the `WorktreeCreate` block from
`/Users/chriswong/Documents/Cluade/Macro Dashboard/.claude/settings.local.json` (and
delete `~/.local/bin/claude-macro-sparse-worktree-create.zsh`) so the checked-in
wiring is the only one. Until that is done both may fire; the Python hook is
idempotent — an existing destination that is already a registered worktree is
reported as success — but the older zsh prototype is not, and it exits non-zero on a
destination that already exists, so leaving both wired indefinitely risks a failed
spawn depending on which runs second.

**Measured 2026-08-13 (Studio).** Full session worktree **3.8 GiB**: `data/` 2.3 +
`site/` 0.73 + `mockups/` 0.23 + `verify_shots/` 0.05 = 3.31 GiB (**87 %**). Sparse
tree **0.35–0.57 GiB** — an ~7–11× cut, better than R8's ~5× estimate because
`mockups/`+`verify_shots/` join R8's two named dirs (same class: committed rendered
artifacts and screenshot evidence, not code). At ~40 new trees/day the standing
active window drops from ~330 GiB toward ~30–50 GiB as trees turn over.

**Escape hatches.** `python3 scripts/worktree_sparse.py full` opts one worktree into
a full checkout (worktree-scoped — `core.sparseCheckout` lives in `config.worktree`,
so siblings are untouched); `… add <dir>` materialises one tree; `… status` reports
state and any stray files a local tool wrote into an omitted tree. Repo-wide revert
is `"enabled": false` in `config/sparse_worktree.json`; it disables both Claude
creation and Codex automatic conversion.

**Honesty properties (the reason this is more than a setup script).** A sparse tree
must never make a guard or test pass for the wrong reason:

- `scripts/check_template_site_sync.py` enumerates its own pair list by walking
  `site/`. Absent `site/`, it printed `sync OK (0 pairs checked)` and exited 0 — a
  vacuous pass on the law protecting the render lanes (`render.yml` carries a long
  comment about the same failure mode reaching the lane: "would render, guard and
  COMMIT whatever subset of the tree it found — a truncated publish, not a red X").
  It now REFUSES and names the opt-in command.
- pytest prints the omitted trees plus that command in its header and in the summary
  of any failing run, skips only tests explicitly marked `needs_full_checkout`, and
  annotates other failures whose traceback names an omitted tree — a wrong answer
  stays red, it just stops being a mystery. Verified visible under `-q`,
  `-q --tb=short`, `-q --tb=line` and the house `-q --tb=no -rf` (where the header and
  the per-failure sections are both suppressed and the terminal-summary NOTE is the
  one that lands — which is why that hook exists alongside the header).
  **DO NOT run the full suite in a sparse worktree.** Measured 2026-08-13: it produces
  **1,281 failures + 419 errors across 247 distinct test files** (against 68,776
  passes) purely as artifacts of the missing trees. Marking those 247 files
  `needs_full_checkout` was considered and REJECTED — it would be an unmaintainable
  diff that permanently masks real regressions in a tenth of the suite. The marker
  stays available for surgical use; the honest instruction is to opt into a full
  checkout first, which is also what every CI lane running the suite already has.
  Nine of those files read an omitted tree at MODULE level and therefore die during
  COLLECTION, before any marker can apply — the terminal-summary NOTE still fires on a
  collection error, which is why the notice is wired to the summary and not only to
  per-test reporting. `tests/test_ship_loop_guard.py::test_the_pair_list_is_the_ci_gate_s_own_enumeration`
  is the one test marked here: it asserts its pair list is non-empty and builds it by
  walking `site/`, so unmarked it fails with a bare `assert set()`.
- **THE ANNOTATOR CANNOT SEE A *SWALLOWED* FileNotFoundError (found 2026-08-19).**
  The bullet above promises a wrong answer "stays red, it just stops being a
  mystery" — but attribution is by name match against the omitted trees in the
  TRACEBACK, so it only fires when the error propagates. Production code that
  catches the missing-reference error ON PURPOSE defeats it completely.
  `hk_board_rank.confirmation_move()` is the worked example: it derives the HK
  vetoed/ran lanes' confirmation close through
  `signal_quality.confirmation_date(..., market="HK")`, which anchors on the
  committed `data/hk/_HSI.parquet`, and it narrowly catches that FileNotFoundError
  because a missing reference is its documented **disclosed-null** case, not a crash
  the nightly should take. That contract is correct and unchanged. Its side effect in
  a sparse tree is that every vetoed row comes back `pct_since: null`, no traceback
  ever names `data/`, no NOTE is attributed — and the HK board pair prints
  **18 clean assertion failures that read exactly like engine-vs-fixture drift**
  (`tests/test_hk_board_ui.py` 5, `tests/test_hk_board_rank.py` 13). Measured on
  origin/main f69f224c9723: 18 failed sparse; `git sparse-checkout add data/hk` on
  the same bytes and nothing else, 0 failed. A session was commissioned to heal them
  as deterministic main reds while main's own ci.yml ran green — the cost this
  records. All eighteen now carry `needs_full_checkout("data")`: this is the
  surgical use the paragraph above reserves, not a retreat from it, and the
  distinguishing test is whether the annotator CAN fire. Where a traceback names the
  omitted tree, leave it red and opt into a full checkout; where production swallows
  the error, the failure is unattributable and marking is the only honest signal.

- Detection reads git's sparse state, never `Path.is_dir()`: `data/` survives
  `git reset --hard` as a **0-byte husk**, so presence checks report it materialised
  while it holds none of its 2.3 GiB. `scripts/worktree_sparse.missing_dirs()` is the
  single detector all callers share.
- A write into an omitted tracked path still reaches `git status` (verified in
  `tests/test_sparse_worktree_profile.py`), so `ship_loop_guard.py`'s dirty snapshot
  keeps working and nothing becomes silently committable.

**VACUOUS-PASS RETROFIT — the seven affirmative-OK guards now REFUSE (fixed 2026-08-13).**
21 `scripts/check_*.py` read `site/` or `data/`. Run in a sparse tree, **12 exit 0**,
and seven of those printed an affirmative OK over an empty set rather than failing.
All seven now refuse instead; the table records what each one used to print, which is
what a regression here would look like again:

| guard | what it printed with the tree absent (now refuses) |
|---|---|
| `check_site_js` | `OK — all standalone JS bundles under site/ parse cleanly` |
| `check_nav_gap` | `OK — every menu page under site/ keeps a ≥14px top gap` |
| `check_nav_mega` | `OK — every shared-nav page under site/ carries the Research mega-menu` |
| `check_badge_passport` | `OK: site dir <abs>/site absent (nothing rendered yet)` — and, over a husk `site/`, `OK: every desk brief carries a passport (0 checked, 0 grandfathered)`; it has TWO vacuous paths and both now refuse |
| `check_cycle_consistency` | `PASS — 0 same-tape group(s) agree` |
| `check_ms_board_coherence` | `ms-board coherence: OK (0 page(s) scanned)` |
| `check_ohlc_basis_coherence` | `no breadth panel carries the ... triple — nothing to check` |

The other nine fail loudly (FileNotFoundError and friends), which was already honest.
`check_template_site_sync` was fixed first, because it is the one the paired plain-copy
asset law depends on; it refuses unconditionally, which is safe only because its callers
were verified to be full checkouts. **A blanket entry-refusal is NOT safe as a sweep**:
several CI lanes check out partial trees on purpose, so a guard that refused whenever
`site/` is not fully present would red a lane working exactly as designed. So the seven
above take the other form — per-guard and **conditional on an EMPTY result set**:

> refuse only when *I checked ZERO items* **AND** *a tree I read is sparse-omitted*.

Both halves are load-bearing. Zero items in a FULL checkout is an honest zero and still
passes; a run that found real items in a partial tree still passes. `scripts/sparse_guard.py`
owns that conjunction (`refuse_if_vacuous`), deriving the trees it needs from the path the
guard was actually pointed at — so a guard aimed at a `tmp_path` stays inert — and
answering `None` on every detector failure, because the detector may never be the thing
that breaks a guard. `tests/test_sparse_guard_refusals.py` pins all seven against a
synthetic repo sparsed with real cone-mode `git sparse-checkout`, and covers both
negative cases so the conditional can never silently become a blanket one.

Callers were audited before the retrofit: **all seven guards are invoked only from full
checkouts** (`ci-pack` in `ci.yml`, `pages.yml`, `ci-main-heartbeat.yml`, and the render
family — `render.yml`, `engine-render.yml`, `earlyclose.yml`, `closing-bell.yml`,
`asia-close.yml`, `daily.yml`, `public-render.yml`). The 13 workflows that DO take a
partial tree — `live-quotes.yml`, `marketing-press-wire.yml`, `marketing-hot-tape.yml`,
`marketing-earnings-wire.yml`, `marketing-x-intel.yml`, `earnings-story-packets.yml`,
`earnings-story-press-stage.yml`, `earnings-evidence-graph.yml`, `company-intelligence.yml`,
`prophet-live.yml`, `key-pool-probe.yml`, `merge-on-green.yml`,
`daily-engine-setup-retry.yml` — invoke none of them.

Standing rule regardless: **a green from a `site/`/`data/` guard in a sparse worktree
means nothing** — run them after `python3 scripts/worktree_sparse.py full`, which is also
what CI does.
