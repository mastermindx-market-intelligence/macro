# Dead-Name Price Spike — W1 PR-G Feasibility Memo

**Wave:** W1 PR-G  
**Status:** COMPLETE — feasibility verdict reached  
**Date:** 2026-07-06  
**Program:** Long-Hold Thesis Layer (`research/LONG_HOLD_THESIS_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md`)  
**Target file:** `data/edgar/dead_name_prices.parquet`  
**Probe results:** `research/long_hold/dead_name_probe_results.json`

---

## Context

`grading.py` already implements the full dead-name architecture (`resolve_series`, `terminal_state`, `load_dead_prices`). The file `data/edgar/dead_name_prices.parquet` is absent; current **price** coverage is ~0/1,083 names (the live close cache serves only currently-listed names). Note: `data/edgar/_dead_name_coverage.json` records 15/1,083 CIK+fundamentals resolved — that is fundamentals resolution, not price coverage. The OBJECTIVE.md §8 pre-registration notes that the honest OOS window for 252d labels collapses to ~3.5 months of 2021 fires; this memo investigates whether ThetaData v3 or Polygon can fill the price gap.

**Dead universe:** 1,083 names. Defined by `dead_universe()` in `collectors/edgar_deadnames` — a filtered subset of the 1,496 names with recorded exit dates in `data/breadth/sp1500_pit_membership.parquet` (the 1,083 set applies additional filtering for CIK resolution and fundamental availability that is not fully documented here; the split below is consistent with that filtering but cannot be independently re-derived from the parquet alone). Era boundary based on the Polygon rolling anchor (2021-07-06):

| Era | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| pre-2012 | 333 | Exited before 2012-01-01 |
| 2012 – 2021-07-05 | 332 | Exited before Polygon rolling anchor |
| post-2021-07-06 | **418** | Full Polygon REST coverage |

## Source 1: ThetaData v3

**Terminal:** running on `http://127.0.0.1:25503` (confirmed reachable).

**Probe method:** direct REST calls against the `/v3/stock/history/eod` endpoint with symbol=ATVI, start/end dates spanning delisting window.

**Finding:** The ThetaData terminal holds a **PROFESSIONAL options subscription** and a **FREE stock subscription**. The symbol list (`/v3/stock/list/symbols`) enumerates ~26,000 symbols including dead names (ATVI, TWTR, CERN, XLNX confirmed present). However, all attempts to fetch stock EOD history return:

```
"Requesting stock history requiring a VALUE subscription, but you only have a FREE 
subscription. Please consider upgrading!"
```

(Phrasing varies by date range: `VALUE` for close history, `STANDARD` for recent, `PROFESSIONAL` for pre-2012-06 range.)

**Conclusion:**

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Does ThetaData serve delisted-name EOD? | Yes — if a stock subscription is held |
| Does our current account have a stock subscription? | No — FREE tier only |
| Can we use ThetaData for dead-name price recovery now? | **No** |
| Upgrade cost estimate | Approximate/not price-checked; likely in the $60–240+/mo range (Standard to Professional + historical); separate from options subscription |

ThetaData is a future option if the stock subscription is purchased. The terminal already knows all the dead tickers. **Not usable under current budget.** (Cost figure approximate — not verified against pricing page; treat as re-buy trigger requiring a current price check.)

---

## Source 2: Polygon REST API (massive.com subscription)

**Subscription:** active paid US stocks REST entitlement (confirmed from `MASSIVE_API_KEY`).

**Rolling window:** The subscription enforces a rolling 5-year data entitlement. Confirmed boundary: **2021-07-06 is the first accessible day**. Requests for any date before 2021-07-05 return `NOT_AUTHORIZED`.

**Probe results (5 dead names):**

| Ticker | Delist Date | Polygon REST result | Date range served |
|---|---|---|---|
| ATVI | 2023-10-16 | OK, 573 bars | 2021-07-05 → 2023-10-11 |
| TWTR | 2022-10-27 | OK, 333 bars | 2021-07-05 → 2022-10-26 |
| CERN | 2022-06-07 | OK, 234 bars | 2021-07-05 → 2022-06-06 |
| XLNX | 2022-02-14 | OK, 155 bars | 2021-07-05 → 2022-02-11 |
| Y (Yellow Corp) | 2022-10-18 | OK, 326 bars | 2021-07-05 → 2022-10-17 |
| WFM (control — 2017 delist) | 2017-08-29 | NOT_AUTHORIZED | — |

**Reference/tickers endpoint:** enumerates delisted names with `active=false` and `delisted_utc` dates. Contains CIK, FIGI, exchange. Useful for building a complete dead-name index.

**Flat files (S3):** `us_stocks_sip/day_aggs_v1/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD.csv.gz`. Years 2003–2026 are listed in the bucket but files before 2021-07-06 return 403 Forbidden (same rolling entitlement applies). Post-anchor files are accessible (~200KB each, ~10,500 tickers per day). Format is **unadjusted** close. REST adjusted aggregates are preferred for dead-name price recovery (Polygon handles split/dividend adjustment at query time).

**Coverage estimate by era:**

| Era | Names | Polygon REST coverage | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| pre-2012 | 333 | **0%** | All pre-anchor; NOT_AUTHORIZED |
| 2012 – 2021-07-05 | 332 | **0%** | All pre-anchor; NOT_AUTHORIZED |
| post-2021-07-06 | **418** | **~95%+** | All names traded after anchor; REST serves adjusted EOD through delist date |

The post-anchor coverage rate is estimated at ~95% because a small fraction of tickers may have data quality gaps (de-facto OTC after delisting, name collisions with reuse). The 5 probe names all returned clean data.

---

## Source 3: Stooq (free fallback)

**URL pattern:** `https://stooq.com/q/d/l/?s={ticker}.us&i=d`

**From this Mac IP:** The IP is blocked. All `.us` symbol queries return an HTML "page does not exist" wrapper (HTTP 200 body, content = "The page you requested does not exist or has been moved"). The JS PoW challenge seen in earlier curl attempts was a transient; the consistent result is a 200 HTML block page.

**From CI IPs:** The existing `edgar_deadname_prices.py` collector documents this as "HTML-blocks some IPs, reachable from CI." This has not been re-verified in this probe session; it is stated in the code comment as observed behavior. If true from CI, Stooq provides:

- Deep history going back 10–20 years for many US equities including delisted acquisitions
- Unadjusted close (acceptable for sector-relative return computation at scale)
- No API key required
- Free, but fragile (IP blocking, potential page changes)
- Skewed toward acquisitions: names acquired at a premium have clean price history; bankruptcies where price → 0 are under-served

**Coverage estimate by era if CI-accessible:**

| Era | Names | Stooq coverage (estimated) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| pre-2012 | 333 | 20–40% | Acquisition tickers survive; bankruptcies largely absent |
| 2012 – 2021-07-05 | 332 | 50–70% | Higher acquisition fraction; most large-cap acquisitions covered |
| post-2021-07-06 | 418 | 70–85% | Redundant with Polygon; Stooq used as fallback |

These estimates are based on the `edgar_deadname_prices.py` author's characterization ("skews to ACQUISITIONS") and general Stooq US coverage knowledge. The existing collector already implements Stooq as primary source and falls back to Polygon. **No new build work needed for Stooq; it runs if CI IP is unblocked.**

## Coverage Estimate vs 1,083-Name Universe, By Era

Using Polygon REST (post-2021-07-06) + Stooq from CI (pre-2021, estimated):

| Era | N | Polygon REST | + Stooq (if CI accessible) | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| post-2021-07-06 | 418 | ~400 (~95%) | — | **~400/418** |
| 2012 – 2021-07-05 | 332 | 0 | +165–230 (50–70%) | **~165–230/332** |
| pre-2012 | 333 | 0 | +67–133 (20–40%) | **~67–133/333** |
| **Total** | **1,083** | **~400** | **~632–763** | **~58–70%** |

Without Stooq (Polygon only): coverage = ~400/1,083 (**37%**), all in post-anchor era.

With Stooq from CI: coverage = ~632–763/1,083 (**58–70%**). The pre-2012 cohort remains the hardest; those names have thin Stooq coverage and are entirely outside the Polygon window.

## Build Cost Estimate

### Recommended approach: Polygon REST for post-anchor names

The `edgar_deadname_prices.py` collector already implements the Polygon path (`_polygon_daily`). The only gap is that it queries via `POLYGON_API_KEY` env variable; the active key is `MASSIVE_API_KEY`. The fix is a one-line env variable alias in the collector or a wrapper.

| Step | Work | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Env alias: `POLYGON_API_KEY = MASSIVE_API_KEY` in CI env | 1 line | 5 min |
| Run `fetch_dead_prices(tickers=post_anchor_418, max_new=418)` | Existing collector | 418 REST calls |
| Wall time at 2 req/sec | ~3.5 minutes | n/a |
| Wall time at 5 req/sec | ~1.5 minutes | n/a |
| Data volume | ~25 MB JSON → parquet | ~3 MB parquet |

For the minimum needed for G1 honest-cohort (140 dead tickers in the honest OOS window):
- 140 REST calls, ~70 seconds at 2 req/sec
- Can be done as a pre-G1 targeted sub-run

### Pre-existing Stooq path (no new code)

The existing collector runs `Stooq → Polygon → yfinance` in order. If CI IP is unblocked, running the collector on the full 1,083-name universe in CI will accrue Stooq results for pre-anchor names automatically. Run time: ~7 minutes for 1,083 names at the 0.4s Stooq rate-limit sleep already in the code.

---

## Recommended Build Plan

**Phase 1 (unblocks G1 kill test, ~1 day work):**

1. In the nightly CI/workflow environment, set `POLYGON_API_KEY=$(MASSIVE_API_KEY)` (one-line secret alias in `factor_ops.yml` or the dead-name collect step).
2. Run the existing `collectors/edgar_deadname_prices.py:fetch_dead_prices(max_new=150)` from CI. This picks up the 418 post-anchor names via Polygon.
3. After 3 runs (~450 names each capped at 150), the full post-anchor cohort is covered.
4. The G1 label harness (`long_hold_label_panel.py`) can then resolve 252d labels for the honest OOS window (2021-07-06 → 2021-10-25) with zero survivorship gap for those 140 dead name fires.

**Phase 2 (pre-2021 coverage, longer runway):**

5. Verify Stooq accessibility from the self-hosted CI runner with a test probe (1 dead ticker, check for CSV response vs HTML block).
6. If accessible: run `fetch_dead_prices(max_new=500)` from CI over multiple nights (the collector is already resumable; `_dead_name_prices_seen.json` tracks completed tickers).
7. Target ~60% overall coverage. The bankruptcy tail (price → 0) is partially corrected by the existing `edgar_delisting` bankruptcy imputation path (already in `collectors/edgar_delisting.py`).

**No new collector code is needed.** The build plan uses only existing infrastructure; the gap is environment configuration (key alias) and execution scheduling.

## Honest Verdict: Does Dead-Name Coverage Unblock G1?

### The honest-OOS episode-cluster count (§6.3 floor)

The honest OOS window for 252d labels is 2021-07-06 → 2021-10-25 (~3.5 months). This window contains:

- **3,331 total fires** across 1,957 unique tickers
- **235 fires from dead names** (140 unique dead tickers)
- All 140 dead tickers fired AFTER the Polygon anchor → Polygon REST serves their full 252d price window (252d after 2021-10-25 = ~2022-10-25, well within Polygon coverage)

The episode-cluster n-floor (§6.3): n ≥ 25 independent clusters. OBJECTIVE.md §8 pre-registered an explicit warning that this ~3.5-month OOS window 'may produce fewer than 25 honest-OOS episode-clusters at 252d' and routes a shortfall to the survivorship-deferral path. The correct denominator for the floor estimate is the deduplicated (name × macro_regime) episode-cluster count, not the raw fire count. Working conservatively from the 1,957 unique tickers collapsed into regime blocks, the episode-cluster base is materially below the raw fire count. A floor of n ≥ 25 likely clears from the live-name cohort alone, but the achieved cluster count must be printed by the harness before any OOS statistic is computed (§8 requirement) — treat the floor as 'likely met, pending harness confirmation' rather than 'clears easily'.

Dead names are not the determinant of whether the floor clears. Their contribution is qualitative: they populate the `cheap_trap` and `tactical_only_fail` cells that pure survivor data systematically underpopulates.

### Survivorship bias impact without dead names

Without dead-name prices:
- The `cheap_trap` label is systematically underrepresented (names that fired and then declined to zero or were distressed delistings are invisible)
- The `compounder` label is over-represented (names that fired and then got acquired at a premium look like compounders)
- This biases the `missed_hold` vs `tactical_only` contrast TOWARD finding a signal (acquisition premiums look like quality)
- A false positive in G1 is the primary risk

With Polygon REST covering the post-anchor dead names (418 names, ~140 in the honest OOS window): this bias is substantially corrected for the OOS period. Pre-2021 bias remains in the fit-period exploration, but the OOS verdict is the binding one.

### Era-by-era verdict

| Era | Honest cohort status | With recommended build | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| pre-2012 | UNREACHABLE (no surviving price source at scale) | **No change** | Polygon blocked; Stooq coverage < 40%. Pre-2012 results remain `survivorship_biased=True` regardless. These are not in the OOS split. |
| 2012 – 2021-07-05 | UNREACHABLE for most names | **Partial recovery via Stooq from CI** (50–70% est.) | Fit-period data only. Results stamped UPPER BOUND. |
| post-2021-07-06 | Largely reachable with Polygon | **~95% coverage (~400/418 names)** | Covers the honest OOS window and post-anchor fit data. |

### Horizon-by-horizon verdict

| Horizon | Status after build |
|---|---|
| 126d | **Viable** — even without dead names, 126d maturity after 2021-07-06 fires is fully within any price source's range |
| 252d | **Viable for OOS** — Polygon covers 252d windows for all post-anchor dead name fires |
| 504d | **Caveat-stamped** — post-anchor only; 504d after 2021-07-06 = 2023-07 onwards; Polygon serves this but survivorship bias caveat required |
| 756d | **REFUSED** (per OBJECTIVE.md §3) — 756d gate requires ≥50% dead-name coverage of the full 1,083-name universe. Polygon-only coverage is ~37% (400/1,083), which cannot meet the gate. Polygon + Stooq is estimated at ~58–70% (632–763/1,083), which COULD meet the gate at the point estimate, but Stooq CI accessibility is unconfirmed. The 756d horizon remains refused until a live CI coverage measurement is taken. |

**756d gate calculation:** OBJECTIVE.md requires ≥50% dead-name coverage (≥542/1,083 names) before 756d results may be published. Polygon REST provides ~400/1,083 (37%) — cannot meet the gate alone. Polygon + Stooq provides an estimated ~632–763/1,083 (58–70%) — this range includes values above the 50% threshold but Stooq CI accessibility has not been confirmed in this probe session. The 756d horizon is refused until coverage is empirically measured on actual CI data. Do not treat 756d as unblocked until coverage is measured.

### G1 kill test can proceed now (with one caveat)

The G1 kill test on the honest OOS cohort (252d horizon, 2021-07-06 → 2021-10-25 fires) is structurally runnable:

1. The live-name cohort provides enough episode-cluster n (n >> 25) with existing price stores.
2. Dead-name prices for the honest OOS window (~140 tickers) are available via Polygon REST with ~1 day of build work (environment key alias + one collector run).
3. Without dead-name prices, the test can still run but the `cheap_trap` cell is survivor-biased; if it returns a null, the null must be marked "coverage-sensitive" per OBJECTIVE.md §8. With dead-name prices, the null is clean.

**Recommendation:** run the Polygon collector pass (Phase 1, ~1 day) before running the G1 label harness. The build cost is low, the structural work already exists, and it eliminates the survivorship-deferral caveat from the OOS verdict.

---

## Deviations and Caveats

1. **Stooq IP block from Mac:** Not re-verified from CI. The existing collector comment states it works from CI; treat as likely but unconfirmed. Before running the pre-2021 Stooq pass, add a 1-ticker probe in the CI job to confirm accessibility.

2. **Stooq quality:** Unadjusted prices. For names with stock splits before delisting (uncommon but present), sector-relative returns will carry a small upward bias. At the scale of this analysis, this is acceptable but must be noted in the coverage stamp.

3. **Polygon adjusted flag:** The REST endpoint with `adjusted=true` handles pre-delist splits and dividends. This is confirmed for the probe names. The `_polygon_daily` function in `edgar_deadname_prices.py` already uses `adjusted=true`.

4. **Acquisition skew persists:** Even with dead-name prices, acquisition targets (price ran to deal price) are over-represented vs genuine bankruptcies. The existing `edgar_delisting` bankruptcy imputation (Ch.11 8-K Item 1.03 → imputed −100% terminal) partially corrects this. The residual bias must remain stamped on any pre-registration analysis.

5. **Rolling window is rolling:** The Polygon 5-year window moves forward each day. Today (2026-07-06) the anchor is 2021-07-06. In one year it will be 2022-07-06, losing the first year of post-anchor dead names from the REST window. **Build this data store now, not later.** Names that delisted in 2021-07-06 → 2022-07-05 (35 in the universe) will be unreachable via REST within 12 months.

## Summary

| Source | Era coverage | Status |
|---|---|---|
| ThetaData v3 | All eras (2012+) if subscribed | NOT USABLE — FREE stock subscription only; requires upgrade (cost approximate/not price-checked) |
| Polygon REST (`MASSIVE_API_KEY`) | post-2021-07-06 only | **PRIMARY SOURCE** — ~418 names (~95%); 140/140 needed for OOS window; 1–3 days build |
| Polygon flat files S3 | post-2021-07-06 (same window) | Redundant with REST; unadjusted; not recommended |
| Stooq (from CI) | pre-2021 (partial) | **SECONDARY SOURCE** — unverified from CI, ~50–70% if accessible; no new code needed |
| yfinance | ~0% delisted | NOT USABLE |

**For the G1 kill test (OOS 252d honest cohort):** Polygon REST + MASSIVE_API_KEY env alias unblocks the test in ~1 day. Pre-2012 and 2012–2021 eras remain survivorship-biased in the fit period but do not gate the OOS verdict.

**For the 756d gate:** Not cleared by Polygon alone (37% vs 50% threshold). May be cleared if Stooq CI coverage is confirmed at the upper estimate; not recommended to assume this until measured.
