## ppi_finaldemand

**Verdict: MODEL** (kill rule: PASS)

**THIN-HISTORY CAVEAT:** PPIFIS vintage history starts 2014-02. After the 60-observation burn-in, the first walk-forward prediction is approximately 2019-02, yielding approximately 90 total predictions and approximately 50-60 in the 2021+ era. Statistics are informative but thin-history confidence is reduced. Kill rule applied as written.

Full window: MAE model=0.3260 vs naive=0.4646 vs trailing3m=0.3625 vs AR3=0.3720 vs expanding_mean=0.4031 (n=87)
2021+ era: MAE model=0.3377 vs naive=0.4696 vs trailing3m=0.3695 vs AR3=0.3930 vs expanding_mean=0.4206 (n=65)

Vs strongest naive (REPORTED, MRI-R28b) — Full: model=0.3260 vs sn=0.3625 => margin=0.0365 (BEATS)
Vs strongest naive (REPORTED, MRI-R28b) — 2021+: model=0.3377 vs sn=0.3695 => margin=0.0318 (BEATS)

\* MAE ExpandMean = REPORTED (non-binding, MRI-R28b). Strongest naive = min(MAE naive, MAE t3m, MAE ExpandMean).

Full p10-p90 coverage: 76.2% (target: ~80%)

Full skew hit-rate: 75.0% (Wilson 95%: [0.648,0.830], n=84)

_Thin-history caveat: PPIFIS vintage history starts 2014-02; first walk-forward prediction approximately 2019-02; expect ~90 total and ~50-60 2021+ predictions._

## retail_sales

**Verdict: SCAFFOLD_ONLY_NO_DATA** (kill rule: NOT_APPLICABLE)

SCAFFOLD-ONLY. RSAFS data is absent from disk as of 2026-07-08. No backtest was run. The attempt clock (#1 of 2) has not started. Projection emits `no_data_rsafs_absent`. Machinery ships so that when data accrues the model can be specified and run.

## Notes

- All outputs are display_only=True, authority=False.
- Nulls are printed, not hidden (MRI-R19).
- sticky/median/flex CPI sourced from ALFRED first-prints (PIT fix 2026-07-08); GASREGW declared unrevised in provenance.
- PPI thin history: kill rule applied as written; no relaxation for thin history.
- Round 2 will wire surviving targets into engine/release_forecast.py dispatch.
- expanding_mean = REPORTED (non-binding, MRI-R28b). Walk-forward expanding mean of target's first-print MoM history, strictly no-lookahead. Slightly underestimates the true expanding mean (excludes burn-in records in training that precede the first prediction) but is strictly no-lookahead.

---

## §12 Restatement (2026-07-10, MRI-R28b)

expanding_mean benchmark added to all era tables above (REPORTED, non-binding per MRI-R28b).
Track N verdicts stand as frozen. All §12 new tracks use the STRONGEST naive (min of naive_prior, trailing3m, expanding_mean) as kill benchmark.
See 'Vs strongest naive' lines per target above for exact margins.

## MRI-R30 Recalibration (2026-07-10) — Vol-Scaled Residual Quantile Bands

**Spec:** research/release_forecast/PREREG_INTERVAL_RECAL_V1.md (frozen before run)
**Points unchanged** — only the bands move.

### pce_headline — BEFORE vs AFTER

| Era | n | p10-p90 BEFORE | p10-p90 AFTER | p25-p75 BEFORE | p25-p75 AFTER | Pinball BEFORE | Pinball AFTER |
|-----|---|----------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| Full | 250 | 78.8% | 79.2% | 44.2% | 48.7% | 0.662662 | 0.910773 |
| 2021+ | 65 | 83.1% | 75.4% | 53.8% | 46.2% | 0.463982 | 0.636170 |
| 2015+ | 137 | 80.3% | 81.0% | 47.4% | 46.0% | 0.577461 | 0.754243 |

**Verdict:** pce_headline was already within [70%,95%] before recalibration. 2021+ coverage decreases (83.1%→75.4%) but remains in gate. Pinball worsens (bands widen in a period that was already well-covered). No coverage falsifier was triggered for this target.

### pce_core — BEFORE vs AFTER

| Era | n | p10-p90 BEFORE | p10-p90 AFTER | p25-p75 BEFORE | p25-p75 AFTER | Pinball BEFORE | Pinball AFTER |
|-----|---|----------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| Full | 250 | 74.3% | 79.2% | 44.2% | 50.0% | 0.578114 | 0.846936 |
| 2021+ | 65 | **67.7%** | **81.5%** | 32.3% | 47.7% | 0.558005 | 0.727853 |
| 2015+ | 137 | 69.3% | 75.9% | 38.0% | 48.2% | 0.550618 | 0.712291 |

**Verdict (PRIMARY — MRI-R30 trigger):** pce_core 2021+ coverage moves from **67.7%** (below [70%,95%] gate) to **81.5%** (within gate). This mirrors the cpi_core improvement: vol-scaling adapts to the elevated inflation-era residual dispersion. Note: pinball worsens (bands wider than necessary for a well-calibrated model), as expected when widening bands for a period that had low coverage. Forward gate: if coverage exits [70%,95%] after 12 more prints, quantile claims drop from UI.

### ppi_finaldemand — BEFORE vs AFTER

| Era | n | p10-p90 BEFORE | p10-p90 AFTER | p25-p75 BEFORE | p25-p75 AFTER | Pinball BEFORE | Pinball AFTER |
|-----|---|----------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| Full | 87 | 76.2% | 77.8% | 44.4% | 42.9% | 0.578674 | 0.592393 |
| 2021+ | 65 | 76.2% | 77.8% | 44.4% | 42.9% | 0.578674 | 0.592393 |

**Verdict:** ppi_finaldemand was already in [70%,95%]. Minor coverage improvement. Thin-history caveat unchanged.

## Seam-Correction Restatement (2026-07-14) — NIPA re-base target fence

**Change:** engine `_null_seam_mom_targets` (PR #2579, follow-up to the #2575 feature fence).
**Not a model or feature change** (anti-mining intact): the ridge specs, feature sets, kill
rule, and era splits are untouched. This is a **data-quality correction** — it drops
observations that were never real inflation prints.

**What was wrong:** the walk-forward target was `pct_change` of ALFRED first-print PCEPI/PCEPILFE
levels. At the five NIPA comprehensive-revision vintages the period-P first print is on a new
index base while P−1 is on the old base, so the "MoM" is a re-base artifact, not inflation:

| Seam period | PCEPI target (old) | PCEPILFE target (old) | Role in frozen backtest |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2003-11 | −7.20 | −6.68 | training row (idx 39) |
| 2009-06 | −10.13 | −8.45 | **scored** step |
| 2013-06 | −8.00 | −7.69 | **scored** step |
| 2018-06 | −5.75 | −4.44 | **scored** step |
| 2023-08 | −5.09 | −6.97 | **scored** step (2021+ era) |

(Real worst PCE MoM is −1.146, Nov-2008.) Four of the five landed past the 60-obs burn-in and
were scored, so they dominated the RMSE and mis-covered the p10–p90 bands in the frozen table
above. The fence nulls these targets; `_walk_forward` then skips them as training rows, scored
steps, and baseline inputs alike. PPIFIS/PPIFES (vintages 2014+) have no seams and are byte-unchanged.

**Corrected metrics (same era/metric code, seam-free):**

| Target | window | n | MAE model | MAE naive | RMSE model | RMSE naive | cov p10–p90 | skew HR | VERDICT |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| pce_headline | full | 245 | 0.1265 | 0.1930 | 0.1768 | 0.2585 | 86.4% | 81.0% | **MODEL** (PASS) |
| pce_headline | 2021+ | 64 | 0.0869 | 0.1912 | 0.1167 | 0.2645 | 93.8% | 84.4% | |
| pce_core | full | 245 | 0.1027 | 0.1150 | 0.1358 | 0.1588 | 77.4% | 71.8% | **MODEL** (PASS) |
| pce_core | 2021+ | 64 | 0.1030 | 0.1501 | 0.1417 | 0.1995 | 76.6% | 76.6% | |
| ppi_finaldemand | full | 87 | 0.3260 | 0.4646 | 0.4029 | 0.6109 | 76.2% | 75.0% | **MODEL** (PASS) — unchanged |
| ppi_finaldemand | 2021+ | 65 | 0.3377 | 0.4696 | 0.4167 | 0.6114 | 76.2% | 72.3% | |

**All three verdicts stand (MODEL / PASS).** The seams inflated model and benchmark error levels
in lockstep, so removing them lowers absolute MAE/RMSE without changing the model-vs-naive
relationship the kill rule tests. One nuance: on the strongest-naive full-window check (MRI-R28b),
frozen pce_core LAGGED expanding_mean by −0.0041 (a seam-contaminated artifact); corrected it BEATS
by +0.0039 (model 0.1027 vs strongest-naive 0.1066). n falls by 5 per PCE target (4 scored seams
removed + the 2003-11 training row deferring the first post-burn-in step by one); 2021+ n falls
65→64 (2023-08 dropped).

The frozen summary table above and the companion `results/backtest_new_targets_v1_summary.json`
snapshot remain the immutable 2026-07-08 pre-fix record; **this section supersedes their PCE
numbers.** The MRI-R30 recalibration tables and `results/interval_recal_v1_coverage.json` use the
same (now seam-corrected) engine; their PCE coverage figures shift accordingly on next regen.
