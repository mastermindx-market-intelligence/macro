# Pre-Registration — CPI Component Bridge V1 (Track CB)

**Frozen:** 2026-07-08
**Program:** Macro Release Intelligence (MRI), Wave 10, Track CB
**Ruling:** MRI-R25 (component-bridge challenger charter)
**Branch:** claude/mri-w10-track-cb
**Status:** AMENDED 2026-07-08 — corrected attempt #1 per Opus review (BLS-partition-derived
corrections, not result-tuned). Engine/test fixes follow in a separate commit AFTER this
pre-registration amendment is committed. See §10 for amendment details.

## AMENDMENT NOTICE (2026-07-08) — Corrected Attempt #1

This amendment is committed BEFORE running the corrected backtest, per anti-mining law §6.
The corrections are mechanically forced by the BLS partition structure and were identified by
Opus review of the original attempt. They are NOT result-driven.

**Corrections applied:**
1. `core_services_ex_shelter` weight corrected to **25.118** = 79.919 − shelter(35.625) −
   core_goods(19.176). Original attempt used 44.294 which forgot to subtract core_goods,
   creating double-count of the full core_goods weight (19.176pp).
2. `food_at_home` is EXCLUDED from the core path (food is excluded from core CPI by
   definition). Original attempt included it in both headline and core.
3. Partition is now a TRUE 100pp sum: all 13 prior-only blocks carry prior MoM × RI weight
   in `point`, so the grand-total basket weight = 100 (headline) / 79.919 (core). Prior blocks
   keep confidence=0.0 but contribute their prior-driven mass. This makes `point` a complete
   estimate, not a partial-coverage artifact.
4. `coverage_residual_pp` replaces the tautological `residual_pp`. Definition:
   `coverage_residual_pp` = 100 − Σ(applied weights). This is ~0 when partition is complete,
   >0 only when a basket share is genuinely uncovered.
5. `prior_driven_share` added: Σ(weights of confidence-0 prior blocks) / 100 — the fraction of
   the estimate that is extrapolation, not fresh proxy. Both fields are printed on the projection
   per MRI-R19 (honesty).

**Outcome declared in advance (per anti-mining law):** If corrected-core STILL fails the kill
rule → core = NULL and the family closes (2-attempt cap). The result is reported honestly
regardless of direction.

---

## 0. Purpose and Anti-Mining Commitment

This document pre-registers the EXACT model specification for the BLS relative-importance CPI
component bridge BEFORE any backtest results are observed. Per MRI §6 anti-mining law: exactly
ONE spec is declared here and frozen. No block weighting, feature selection, or method iteration
after results are seen. Kill-rule verdict is printed regardless of direction.

This is the SECOND CHALLENGER (Track CB, parallel to Track M). The champion (frozen v2 ridge)
keeps the card; Track CB enters as a shadow-eligible challenger only.

---

## 1. Model Class

**Component bridge (not a regression).** Each block computes a MoM estimate from its PIT-safe
proxy series, multiplied by the BLS Dec-2025 relative-importance weight → contribution in
percentage-points. Headline estimate = sum of contributions + residual. The residual is the
unmodelled basket share (prior-only blocks at their prior MoM × their RI weight) — it is PRINTED,
never hidden (MRI-R19 / MRI-R25).

No sklearn, statsmodels, or scipy.stats. Pure numpy/pandas.

## 2. BLS Relative-Importance Weights (Dec-2025 basis, in effect Jan–Dec 2026)

Source: https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/2025.htm  
Basis: December 2025 (Table 1, 2024 expenditure weights), CPI-U U.S. City Average  
PIT rule: weights are FROZEN for the calendar year (January 2026 – December 2026); refresh each
January. Weights are not ALFRED-vintaged — treat as revision_optimistic for the weight leg.

All-items = 100.000 (denominator). Component weights listed in
`data/release_forecast/component_weights/cpi_relative_importance_2026.yml`.

---

## 3. Blocks and Per-Block MoM Method (frozen per MRI-R25)

### 3.1 Block 1 — Energy (modelled, confidence = 1.0)

**RI weight (CPI-U):**
- Gasoline (all types): 2.895
- Electricity (APU000072610): derived from Housing→Fuels and utilities→Electricity sub-item

**Gasoline sub-block:**
- Source: `data/fred/GASREGW.parquet` (weekly EIA price, unrevised)
- Method: reference-month average vs prior-month average MoM % (identical to champion gasoline_mom)
  - PIT: asof determines what weeks are knowable for the reference month M
  - `ref_month_avg = mean(GASREGW where date in [M_start, M_end ∩ asof])`
  - `prior_month_avg = mean(GASREGW where date in [M-1_start, M-1_end])`
  - `gasoline_mom = (ref_month_avg / prior_month_avg - 1) × 100`
- Declared `unrevised_legs` (administrative survey, unrevised in practice)

**Electricity sub-block:**
- Source: `data/fred/APU000072610.parquet` (BLS average electricity price, monthly, 1978-11+)
- Method: month-over-month % change of the most recent knowable print (non-vintaged → revision_optimistic)
  - PIT: electricity releases with the CPI; at decision date (day before target release), the last
    knowable electricity value is for month M-1 (same lag as shelter)
  - `elec_mom = (elec[M-1] / elec[M-2] - 1) × 100`
- Declared `revision_optimistic_legs`

**Energy contribution:** `(gasoline_mom × gasoline_weight + elec_mom × elec_weight) / (gasoline_weight + elec_weight) × energy_total_weight / 100`

More precisely:
```
energy_contribution_pp = (gasoline_mom/100) × gasoline_weight + (elec_mom/100) × elec_weight
```

### 3.2 Block 2 — Shelter (modelled, confidence = 0.6)

**RI weight (CPI-U):**
- Rent of primary residence: 7.840
- Owners' equivalent rent (OER): 26.204
- Total shelter: 35.625 (also includes lodging away from home: 1.289; OER + rent of primary = 34.044)

**Method:** existing `_compute_shelter_nowcast` from `engine/release_components_cpi.py`
(PREREG_V2.md §2, frozen k=0.35, ZORI lease-reset window M-12..M-6, divergence guard).
- PIT: ZORI +45-day lag; CPI shelter knowable through M-1 at decision date
- Sources: `data/zori/national.parquet` + `data/fred/CUSR0000SAH1.parquet`
- Declared `revision_optimistic_legs` (CUSR0000SAH1 not ALFRED-vintaged)

**Contribution:**
```
shelter_contribution_pp = (shelter_nowcast/100) × shelter_weight
```
where `shelter_weight = 35.625` (full shelter basket).

### 3.3 Block 3 — Food at Home (modelled, confidence = 0.4)

**RI weight:** 8.325

**Method:** PPI farm products (WPU01) as directional momentum signal applied to CUSR0000SAF11
prior MoM:
1. Compute `wpu01_mom` = WPU01 MoM % for most-recent PIT-knowable month (non-vintaged)
2. Compute `fah_prior_mom` = most-recent knowable CUSR0000SAF11 MoM %
3. Bridge estimate: blend prior with momentum signal
   - `sign_signal = sign(wpu01_mom)` if `abs(wpu01_mom) > 1.0`, else 0.0 (directional threshold)
   - `fah_mom_est = fah_prior_mom + 0.2 × sign_signal × abs(fah_prior_mom)`
   - Clamped to `max(fah_prior_mom × 0.5, min(fah_prior_mom × 1.5, fah_mom_est))`
   - If either source is missing, falls back to `fah_prior_mom` (pure prior)
   - If both missing, block falls to `prior_only = True`
- PIT: WPU01 releases typically 1-2 weeks before CPI; CUSR0000SAF11 is non-vintaged (revision_optimistic)
- Sources: `data/fred/WPU01.parquet` + `data/fred/CUSR0000SAF11.parquet`
- Declared `revision_optimistic_legs` for both series

**Contribution:**
```
food_at_home_contribution_pp = (fah_mom_est/100) × food_at_home_weight
```

**Confidence:** 0.4 (directional proxy — weaker than energy/shelter).

### 3.4 Block 4 — Core Goods Pipeline (modelled, confidence = 0.6)

**RI weight target:** "Commodities less food and energy" = 19.176 (covers new vehicles, used
vehicles, apparel, medical commodities, other core goods).

**Method:** PPIFIS (PPI Final Demand) and PPIFES (PPI Final Demand ex-food and energy)
momentum as in the champion pipeline leg.
- Source: vintages (`data/fred_vintage/vintages.parquet`) via `knowable_series`
- `ppifis_mom` = lag-1 MoM of PPIFIS (ALFRED-vintaged, PIT-safe)
- `ppifes_mom` = lag-1 MoM of PPIFES (ALFRED-vintaged, PIT-safe)
- Bridge estimate: `pipeline_mom_est = 0.5 × ppifis_mom + 0.5 × ppifes_mom` (equal weight)
  - If one missing, use the other; if both missing, block falls to prior_only

**Contribution:**
```
core_goods_contribution_pp = (pipeline_mom_est/100) × core_goods_weight
```

**Confidence:** 0.6 (ALFRED-vintaged proxy) — **full-leg construction only**; see §11.

### 3.5 Block 5 — Core Services ex-Shelter (modelled, confidence = 0.4)

**RI weight target:** CUSR0000SASLE is "All items less energy, shelter, and food". Its RI
complement is derived as:
- `csxs_weight` = All items less food and energy (79.919) − shelter (35.625) − core_goods (19.176) = **25.118**
- This is the correct BLS partition: the three modelled core blocks (shelter 35.625,
  core_goods 19.176, core_svc_xs_shelter 25.118) sum to exactly 79.919 (= all items less
  food and energy). No overlap, no double-count.
- **CORRECTED from original attempt:** Original used 44.294 = 79.919 − 35.625 (forgot to
  subtract core_goods), creating double-count of 19.176pp.

**NOTE (Block 3 / food_at_home):** Food is EXCLUDED from core CPI by definition.
The `food_at_home` block (RI weight 8.325) is included in the HEADLINE path only.
For the CORE path, food_at_home is gated out (same gate as energy blocks).

**Method:** Persistence — CUSR0000SASLE lag-1 MoM applied as estimate for upcoming month.
- Source: `data/fred/CUSR0000SASLE.parquet` (non-vintaged, revision_optimistic)
- `csxs_prior_mom` = most-recent knowable CUSR0000SASLE MoM %
- `csxs_mom_est = csxs_prior_mom` (pure persistence; confidence reflects this is weak)
- PIT: CUSR0000SASLE releases with CPI; last knowable = M-1

**Contribution:**
```
csxs_contribution_pp = (csxs_mom_est/100) × csxs_weight
```

**Confidence:** 0.4 (persistence-only, no forward proxy; series not ALFRED-vintaged).

---

## 4. Prior-Only Blocks (confidence = 0.0 per MRI-R25)

All blocks not modelled above → prior MoM × RI weight, confidence = 0.0, no proxy.
No free PIT proxy exists for these; modelling them would be false precision.

| Block | RI Weight (CPI-U) | Prior Series | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| Food away from home | 5.373 | Prior MoM | No free scanner/restaurant data |
| Alcoholic beverages | 0.840 | Prior MoM | No free PIT proxy |
| New vehicles | 3.838 | Prior MoM | Manheim auction is paid |
| Used vehicles | 2.759 | Prior MoM | Manheim is paid |
| Airline fares | 0.881 | Prior MoM | No free RT booking data |
| Lodging away from home | 1.289 | Prior MoM | STR data is paid |
| Medical care | 8.423 | Prior MoM | No free monthly proxy |
| Apparel | 2.368 | Prior MoM | No free RT proxy |
| Recreation | 5.137 | Prior MoM | No free RT proxy |
| Education & communication | 5.846 | Prior MoM | No free RT proxy |
| Other goods & services | 2.902 | Prior MoM | No free RT proxy |
| Motor vehicle insurance | 2.754 | Prior MoM | No free proxy |
| Other transportation | remaining | Prior MoM | No free proxy |

## 5. Bridge Math (CORRECTED per amendment 2026-07-08; frozen per MRI-R19 / MRI-R25)

The bridge is a TRUE partition to 100. All 13 prior-only blocks carry prior MoM × RI weight
in `point`, so the sum of applied weights = 100.0 (headline) / 79.919 (core). No weight is
dropped; no basket share is excluded from the estimate.

```
# Modelled blocks (fresh proxy):
modelled_sum = Σ_i (block_mom_est / 100) × block_weight   where prior_only == False

# Prior-only blocks (13 blocks, confidence=0.0, carry own prior MoM):
prior_sum = Σ_i (prior_mom / 100) × block_weight          where prior_only == True

# Grand total estimate (= true 100pp partition when all blocks present):
point = modelled_sum + prior_sum
```

Honesty fields (both PRINTED per MRI-R19, never hidden):
```
coverage_residual_pp = 100 - Σ(applied weights)
    # ~0 when partition complete; >0 only for genuinely uncovered basket share

prior_driven_share = Σ(weights of confidence-0 prior blocks) / 100
    # fraction of the estimate driven by extrapolation rather than fresh proxy
```

The old `residual_pp = headline_est - (modelled_sum + prior_sum)` was tautologically 0 by
construction and has been replaced by `coverage_residual_pp` (the real coverage gap).

Core estimate uses same blocks but excludes energy (gasoline, electricity) AND food_at_home.
Core weight reconciliation: Σ all core block weights = 79.919 (all items less food+energy).

**weight_coverage** = sum of RI weights for modelled (non-prior) blocks / 100.0

## 6. Output Schema

Returns a dict matching the champion's `release_forecast.v2` schema, tagged:
- `model = 'cpi_bridge'`
- `display_only = True`
- `authority = False`
- `components`: list of `{block, contribution_pp, weight, confidence, prior_only}` — includes
  ALL blocks (both modelled and prior-only) for full transparency
- `weight_coverage`: share of the CPI basket backed by modelled (non-prior) blocks (float, 0–1)
- `coverage_residual_pp`: 100 − Σ(applied weights); real coverage gap (~0 when partition complete)
- `prior_driven_share`: Σ(weights of confidence-0 prior blocks) / 100 — extrapolation fraction
- `revision_optimistic_legs`: list of non-ALFRED-vintaged series used

---

## 7. Kill Rule (frozen per MRI §11.1)

Same as champion:
- Model MAE ≥ naive_prior MAE in BOTH the full window AND the 2021+ slice → NOT SHADOWED
- Era splits: full (all periods) and 2021+ (2021-01 onward)
- COVID months (2020-03..2020-06) excluded from era stats (same as champion)
- Max 2 spec attempts (this is attempt 1; second attempt requires new adjudication)
- Comparison baselines: naive_prior (last own-series MoM), trailing_3m (3-month mean), champion ridge

---

## 8. PIT Provenance Declarations

| Series | Vintaged | Declaration |
|---|---|---|
| GASREGW | No (administrative, unrevised) | unrevised_legs |
| APU000072610 | No | revision_optimistic_legs |
| CUSR0000SAH1 | No | revision_optimistic_legs |
| ZORI national | No (+45d lag applied) | revision_optimistic_legs |
| CUSR0000SAF11 | No | revision_optimistic_legs |
| WPU01 | No | revision_optimistic_legs |
| CUSR0000SASLE | No | revision_optimistic_legs |
| PPIFIS | Yes (ALFRED) | PIT-safe via knowable_series |
| PPIFES | Yes (ALFRED) | PIT-safe via knowable_series |
| CPIAUCSL | Yes (ALFRED) | PIT-safe (for prior MoM target baseline) |
| CPILFESL | Yes (ALFRED) | PIT-safe (for prior MoM core baseline) |

---

## 9. What This Is NOT

- Not a regression. No trained coefficients. Weights come from BLS, not from data fitting.
- Not scored or authority-bearing. display_only=True, authority=False enforced in engine.
- Not the champion. The champion (v2 ridge) keeps the card. This is a shadow challenger.
- Not iterated. No block/weight/method changes after results are observed (this freeze).

---

## 10. Prior-Only Block Weights (complete list for partition verification)

The 13 prior-only blocks below complete the 100pp partition. Each carries own prior-series MoM × weight.
confidence=0.0 for all. Headline grand-total Σ = 100.0; core grand-total Σ = 79.919.

| Block | RI Weight | Own Prior Series | Core? |
|---|---|---|---|
| food_away_from_home | 5.373 | CPIAUCSL (headline proxy) | No (food excluded from core) |
| food_at_home (prior fallback) | 8.325 | CUSR0000SAF11 | No (food excluded from core) |
| alcoholic_beverages | 0.840 | CPIAUCSL (headline proxy) | No (food-family excluded) |
| new_vehicles | 3.838 | CPIAUCSL (headline proxy) | Yes |
| used_vehicles | 2.759 | CPIAUCSL (headline proxy) | Yes |
| airline_fares | 0.881 | CPIAUCSL (headline proxy) | Yes |
| lodging_away_from_home | 1.289 | CPIAUCSL (headline proxy) | Yes (shelter sub-item already modelled separately) |
| medical_care | 8.423 | CPIAUCSL (headline proxy) | Yes |
| apparel | 2.368 | CPIAUCSL (headline proxy) | Yes |
| recreation | 5.137 | CPIAUCSL (headline proxy) | Yes |
| education_and_communication | 5.846 | CPIAUCSL (headline proxy) | Yes |
| other_goods_and_services | 2.902 | CPIAUCSL (headline proxy) | Yes |
| motor_vehicle_insurance | 2.754 | CPIAUCSL (headline proxy) | Yes |

Note: "own prior series" = last knowable MoM of the headline own-series (CPIAUCSL for headline,
CPILFESL for core) used as the fallback prior MoM for unlisted sub-items. This is the most
conservative proxy: it assumes prior-only blocks track the aggregate at the prior MoM rate.

## 11. AMENDMENT (2026-07-26) — Partial-leg disclosure, display tier only

**Nothing frozen changes.** No block weight, MoM method, fallback rule, bridge math (§5),
output contract (§6), or kill rule (§7) is touched. The point estimate for every input
state is byte-identical to the pre-amendment engine. This amendment is DISCLOSURE only,
and applies to a `display_only=True` / `authority=False` surface, so no gauntlet applies.

### What was wrong

§3.2–§3.5 pin each modelled block's confidence to a single number, stated flatly, while
three of those blocks pre-register a **reduced-leg fallback**:

| Block | Legs | Pre-registered fallback | Prereg confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| shelter (§3.2) | ZORI + CUSR0000SAH1 | k=0 pure-BLS, or ZORI-only (PREREG_V2 §2.6) | 0.6 |
| food_at_home (§3.3) | CUSR0000SAF11 + WPU01 | pure prior, or WPU01-scaled | 0.4 |
| core_goods_pipeline (§3.4) | PPIFIS + PPIFES | "If one missing, use the other" | 0.6 |

The fallback **math is correct and stays frozen**. What the spec never priced is the
*confidence* of the reduced-leg state — so a one-leg block shipped indistinguishable from
a full-leg one: same confidence, `prior_only: false`, `absent_legs: []`. The degradation
existed only inside `pit_provenance.block_provenance` (e.g. `n_series: 1`), which
`scripts/build_release_forecast.py::_attach_shadows_to_items` discarded when it rebuilt
the shadow as a literal dict. Net effect: the shipped artifact could not distinguish the
two states at all.

### What this amendment adds

1. **Per-component disclosure** on every component row: `legs_used`, `legs_expected`,
   `missing_legs`, `degraded`. `degraded` is True only for the middle state — a block that
   SHIPPED an estimate on partial inputs. A block with no estimate at all remains disclosed
   by the existing `prior_only: true`, and is NOT double-flagged.
2. **`degraded_blocks`** roll-up at bridge top level, in `pit_provenance`, on the shipped
   shadow payload, and on new forward-ledger shadow rows.
3. **Confidence haircut:** `block_confidence × (legs_used / legs_expected)`.

### Why the haircut is legitimate here

- It **cannot be tuned to a result** — the scale is the leg fraction, with no free parameter.
- It is **inert wherever the frozen spec's own conditions hold**: with every leg present the
  factor is 1 and each block returns its §3.2–§3.5 value unchanged.
- It governs **only the state the prereg left unpriced**, and the direction is forced —
  fewer inputs cannot mean more confidence.
- It reaches **no authority surface**. The bridge is display-tier; `release_combined.py`
  weights inputs by shrunk inverse-MAE from scored errors, not by this number, and
  `release_block_scoring.py` reads `contribution_pp`/`weight`, not confidence.

`prior_only` is deliberately NOT flipped for a degraded block: that field drives
`weight_coverage`, `prior_driven_share`, `modelled_sum_pp` and `prior_sum_pp`, all defined
in §5. A degraded block is still a modelled block. Test-enforced in
`tests/test_release_cpi_bridge.py::TestPartialLegPreregInvariants`.
