# Odds Desk — Historical Base-Rate Analyzer + Factor Match screener
## Build spec v1 (2026-07-11) — for the macro dashboard (macro repo)

### What this is
A clone-and-improve of tradeodds.io's flagship features, native to our stack:

1. **Analyzer** — pick a ticker; the page shows today's "market fingerprint" as a set of
   toggleable conditions (each with today's observed value); every active condition filters
   35y of history to days that matched; the verdict is the empirical base rate of what
   happened next (win %, median/mean return, CI, sample size), plus the matching-day table,
   a forward price-path cone, and a return histogram.
2. **Factor Match** — a universe screener: the same condition template applied to every
   symbol (each vs its OWN history, sharing today's market-level context), ranked by
   historical win rate per horizon (1d/5d/20d) with a min-sample floor.

### How tradeodds.io does it (recon findings, for reference)
- One `daily_metrics` table: 35y × 3,210 symbols × 22M rows; ~16 pre-bucketed smallint
  INDEXED factor columns + pre-computed forward-return columns `fwd_1d/5d/20d_pct`
  (holiday-aligned, open-to-close: next open → close of horizon end).
- `POST /api/analyze-setup` = WHERE equality (±tolerance) on active bucket columns +
  aggregate. Response carries per-instance rows with every bucket value.
- Factor Match = same filter per symbol vs own history, shared market context
  (`regime_factors`), `min_instances` floor, response rows
  `{symbol, sector, current_factors, analysis_1d/5d/20d: {instances, mean_return, win_rate}}`.
- Bucket schemes (from their glossary/UI): Market Trend = SPY vs SMA50/200 four-state
  (Full Bull / Bull Correction / Bear Rally / Full Bear); VIX level bands (<12, 12–15,
  15–20, 20–25, 25–35, 35+ per impl); VIX move in 2% steps; RSI 5 zones (30/45/55/70);
  magnitude in 0.5-ATR steps; streaks in consecutive-day counts; volume streak vs 20d avg
  (±8 cap); overnight gap buckets; month-of-year; earnings/analyst (Pro; we skip v1);
  "Macro Risk" = yield-curve inversion only (ours will be far richer).
- Returns measured **open-to-close** ("what a trader could actually execute").
- Pipeline: nightly recompute; forward returns for older rows recomputed each run.

### Our architecture (static site — no server)
- **Engine (Python, nightly build)**: `engine/odds_lab.py` (pure functions) +
  `scripts/build_odds.py` (build lane). Computes per-ticker daily factor matrices +
  forward returns from the repo's parquet stores, publishes compact columnar JSON.
- **Client (JS)**: matching + stats run in the browser over the selected ticker's matrix
  (~9k rows × ~20 int cols; trivial). Factor Match is precomputed nightly for a small set
  of condition templates over the whole universe (arbitrary combos stay available on the
  single-name Analyzer; a screener template picker is the honest static-site trade).
- **Data plane**: heavy per-ticker matrices → `site/oddsmatrix/<T>.json` on **R2**
  (5-spot wiring, see below). Light artifacts stay in git/Pages:
  `site/oddsdata/catalog.json`, `site/oddsdata/factor_match.json`.

### Database / backfill answer (updated for audited data reality)
Audit findings: `data/yahoo/` (708 tickers) has close-only columns and uneven depth;
`data/stocks/` (230 tickers, 1980→) lacks OPEN; `data/baskets/ohlcv/` (2,519 tickers) has
full OHLCV but only 2014→. Our open-to-close fwd convention + gap factor need real opens
with deep history → **new dedicated store `data/odds_ohlcv/<T>.parquet`** (columns
open/high/low/close/volume, auto-adjusted), populated by `build_odds.py` itself:
- Ticker missing or stale >3 trading days → `yfinance` fetch: `period="max"` when the
  stored series is missing/shallow (one-time backfill; SPY→1993, many megacaps→1980s),
  else a 1-month overlap window upserted (mirrors `collectors/yahoo.py` line ~60 pattern).
- Store is **gitignored + R2-backed** (the `massive_stock_day` pattern) via publish_r2
  `_DATA_DIRS`; the self-hosted macstudio runners keep it on disk between runs, R2 is the
  cold-start hydration. NOTE `_DATA_DIR_MIN_FILES = 100` guard → universe must be ≥100
  names (it is) or the guard needs a per-dir override.
- The matrix build **recomputes the full factor matrix every run** (vectorized; seconds)
  — forward returns self-fill as future bars arrive; no incremental-index maintenance.
- ^VIX: use existing `data/yahoo/_VIX.parquet` (1990-01-02→, has close) — do NOT refetch.
- SPY for `mkt_trend`: from the odds store (fallback `data/yahoo/SPY.parquet`, 1993→).
- Macro quad joins from `data/regime/regime_history.parquet` (14,485 rows, **1971→**,
  cols incl. `quad`, `liquidity`, `transition_state`) — full coverage of our price history.

### Factor catalog (exact bucket contracts — unit-test the boundaries)
All buckets are small ints. Null (missing input) = JSON null; never matches while active.

**Market-level** (computed once per date from SPY, ^VIX, regime history; joined to all tickers):
| id | definition |
|----|------------|
| `mkt_trend` | SPY close vs SMA50/SMA200 (both include day t): 0 = Full Bull (>50 & >200), 1 = Bull Correction (<50, >200), 2 = Bear Rally (>50, <200), 3 = Full Bear (<both) |
| `vix_level` | ^VIX close: 0 <12, 1 12–15, 2 15–20, 3 20–25, 4 25–35, 5 ≥35 |
| `vix_move` | round(vix 1d %chg / 2), clip ±8 (2% steps) |
| `month` | 1..12 |
| `quad` | our macro quad from regime_history (map Q1..Q4 → 1..4; null where absent) — **our differentiator, tradeodds has nothing like it** |

**Asset-level** (per ticker):
| id | definition |
|----|------------|
| `pct_move` | close-to-close 1d %chg: round(pct / 0.25), clip ±12 (0.25% steps, ±3% tails) |
| `magnitude` | round(pct / (0.5 × atr_pct)), clip ±6, where atr_pct = ATR14 (Wilder) computed through **t−1** ÷ close[t−1] (prior-day ATR so "today's move vs typical" has no same-day contamination). Null until 15 bars. |
| `rsi_zone` | RSI14 (Wilder) at t: −2 <30, −1 30–45, 0 45–55, +1 55–70, +2 ≥70 |
| `rsi_slope` | rsi[t] − rsi[t−3]: −2 ≤−8, −1 (−8,−2], 0 (−2,+2), +1 [+2,+8), +2 ≥+8 |
| `rel_vol` | volume ÷ SMA20(volume through t−1): −2 <0.5, −1 0.5–0.8, 0 0.8–1.2, +1 1.2–1.75, +2 1.75–2.5, +3 ≥2.5 |
| `trend_structure` | s = (EMA9 − EMA21)/close: −2 ≤−1%, −1 (−1%,−0.15%], 0 (−0.15%,+0.15%), +1 [+0.15%,+1%), +2 ≥+1% |
| `streak` | signed run of consecutive up(+)/down(−) closes ending at t (flat close resets to 0), clip ±5 |
| `vol_streak` | signed run of consecutive days volume above(+)/below(−) its 20d SMA, clip ±8 |
| `gap` | (open[t] − close[t−1])/close[t−1]: round(pct / 0.25), clip ±6 |
| `dist_52w` | close vs rolling 252d max close: 0 ≥−1%, −1 (−5%,−1%], −2 (−10%,−5%], −3 (−20%,−10%], −4 ≤−20% (bonus factor tradeodds lacks) |

**Outcomes** (per ticker; ints in basis points, null when future bars missing):
- `fwd1_bp` = close[t+1]/open[t+1] − 1; `fwd5_bp` = close[t+5]/open[t+1] − 1;
  `fwd20_bp` = close[t+20]/open[t+1] − 1. Trading-bar aligned via positional index
  (never calendar math). Open-to-close convention, same as tradeodds, documented in UI.
- `ret_bp` = close[t]/close[t−1] − 1 (for client-side path reconstruction & charts)
- `gap_bp` = open[t]/close[t−1] − 1 (path: close[d+k]/open[d+1] = Π(1+ret[d+1..d+k]) ÷ (1+gap[d+1]))

### Matching semantics (client, and mirrored in the factor-match precompute)
- Candidate day d (excluding today; within selected range) matches iff for every ACTIVE
  factor: |bucket(d) − bucket(today)| ≤ tol. tol = 0 for categorical (`mkt_trend`,
  `month`, `quad`) and = global tolerance setting (0/1/2, default 0) for ordered factors.
- Days with null active-factor buckets or null outcome for the chosen horizon are excluded.
- Data range selector: 5y / 10y / 20y / max (default 10y).
- Default active set (mirrors tradeodds defaults): `magnitude` + `vix_level` + `mkt_trend`.

### Stats (client JS + tested Python mirror)
- n, wins (fwd>0), win_rate, median, mean, p25/p75, min/max.
- **Wilson 95% CI** on win rate (their "46–61%" chip).
- **Unconditional base rate** over the same range+horizon shown alongside — verdict is
  colored by edge-vs-base (≥+5pts green, ≤−5pts red, else neutral), the honest-coloring
  house rule from the BTC forward cones. Never color by raw win rate.
- n<20 → low-sample warning badge; n<5 → "insufficient sample", no verdict color.

### Files & contracts
- `site/oddsmatrix/<T>.json` — `{"schema":"odds_matrix.v1","ticker","asof","dates":[epoch_days...],"close":[...],"cols":{<factor_id>:[...], "ret_bp":[], "gap_bp":[], "fwd1_bp":[], "fwd5_bp":[], "fwd20_bp":[]}}` (columnar, ascending dates)
- `site/oddsdata/catalog.json` — `{"schema":"odds_catalog.v1","asof","market":{today's market buckets + raw values (vix level & 1d chg, spy vs smas, quad)},"factors":[{id,group,label_en,label_zh,desc_en,desc_zh,buckets:{<int>:{label_en,label_zh}},ordered:bool}],"universe":[{t,name,sector}],"defaults":{active:["magnitude","vix_level","mkt_trend"],range:"10y",horizon:"1d"},"coverage":{declared,built,dropped:[{t,reason}],built_utc}}` — `coverage` is the additive observability census (declared vs built vs dropped-with-reason; `built_utc` doubles as the nightly heartbeat, so the file commits even when market data is unchanged)
- `site/oddsdata/factor_match.json` — `{"schema":"odds_factor_match.v1","asof","market":{...},"templates":[{id,label_en,label_zh,factors:[...]}],"horizons":["1d","5d","20d"],"range":"20y","min_n":10,"rows":[{"t","name","sec","cur":{factor:bucket...},"res":{<template>:{<horizon>:[n,win_rate,median_bp,mean_bp]}}}]}`
  Templates v1: core=[magnitude,vix_level,mkt_trend]; trend=[mkt_trend,trend_structure,rsi_zone];
  momentum=[pct_move,streak,rsi_slope]; vol=[vix_level,vix_move,rel_vol];
  quad=[quad,mkt_trend,magnitude]; strict=[magnitude,vix_level,mkt_trend,rsi_zone,rsi_slope].
- `templates/odds.html.j2` → rendered `site/odds.html` by build_odds.py; `site/odds.js`,
  `site/odds.css` (hand-maintained statics, tracked in git, cache-busted `?v=1`).

### UI spec (bar: institutional / Perplexity–Koyfin grade — see aesthetic memory)
- Copy nav from a current origin/main standalone page template; bilingual `L(en,zh)` spans
  everywhere; theme.css vars only; refined flat + generous spacing; glass only on chrome.
- Top bar: ticker search (typeahead over catalog universe, logo via
  `cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/nvstly/icons@main/ticker_icons/<T>.png`, eager load + onerror hide),
  today's move chip, Outcome selector (Next Day / Next Week 5d / Next Month 20d),
  Range selector (5y/10y/20y/Max), tolerance stepper (Exact/±1/±2).
  (Observed-period multi-day patterns = v2; show selector stub disabled with "soon".)
- Left rail "Market Context": grouped conditions (Core: Price Move %, Move Intensity ATR ·
  Market: VIX Level, VIX Move, Market Trend, Macro Quad, Month · Asset: RSI Zone, RSI Slope,
  Rel Volume, Trend Structure, Streak, Volume Streak, Overnight Gap, 52w Distance). Each row:
  name + today's observed value ("VIX 17.5 · 15–20") + toggle. Active count chip. Live
  match-count feedback as toggles flip.
- Verdict hero: big win% + "closed higher/lower", median & mean, sample n, Wilson CI chip,
  edge-vs-base chip ("+4.2pts vs unconditional"), plain-English EN/zh sentence
  ("On Fri Jul 10, SPY rose 0.43% with a minimal 0.5-ATR move, VIX 15–20, market Full Bull.
  Across 168 similar days in 10y, next day closed higher 53.6% (median +0.06%)."),
  open-to-close footnote + not-investment-advice line.
- Tabs: **Matching Days** (mm_charts price line with matched-day dots colored by outcome +
  sortable table: date, key active buckets, fwd return; CSV export), **Price Path** (median
  cumulative path + p25–75 band over 20 forward days, from matched instances), **Returns**
  (histogram of horizon returns + one-tick-per-instance strip).
- **Factor Match tab**: template picker (the precomputed combos) + universe table: symbol
  (logo), sector, today-condition summary sentence, per-horizon n/win%/median, sortable
  columns, min-n filter, sector filter. Row click → loads that ticker in the Analyzer.
- Empty/degraded states: missing matrix → quiet "no data for <T>"; stale asof (>3 trading
  days) → amber "data as of" banner. Degrade, never raise.

### House rules (hard requirements)
- Additive leaves; degrade-never-raise everywhere (engine step must never fail the build).
- **Display-only**: no engine-contract changes, nothing feeds sizing/decisions.
- Bilingual EN/中文 on every user-facing string.
- Weights/params in config.yml under an `odds:` block (universe list, ranges, templates,
  min_n, bucket params) — no magic numbers in code.
- R2 wiring for the new heavy dir `site/oddsmatrix/` — deliberately **NOT** via the
  data_base.js shim regex (odds.js prefixes fetches with `window.DATA_BASE||''` itself, so
  no global fetch-shim change and local preview is controllable). Wire these 4 spots:
  (1) publish_r2 DEFAULT_DIRS (site list) + `_DATA_DIRS` entry for `data/odds_ohlcv`,
  (2) daily.yml publish lane `--dirs` (line ~1732 pattern, non-fatal `|| echo ::warning`),
  (3) daily.yml (+weekly if it has one) Pages-strip `rm -rf` step (line ~1749),
  (4) .gitignore: `site/oddsmatrix/`, `data/odds_ohlcv/*.parquet` (negate manifests if any).
- Page render goes through `lib/pages.write_page` (injects the data_base shim) like
  build_congress.py lines 631–644; register in daily.yml engine job as a
  `run_py "odds desk (build_odds)" scripts.build_odds` line; builder returns 0 on error.
- Template extends `report_base.html.j2` (shared `_site_nav.html.j2` comes free) and uses
  the `t('EN','中文')` macro pattern (see congress_trades.html.j2:3-5).
- Venv for all python: `"/Users/chriswong/Documents/Cluade/Macro Dashboard/.venv/bin/python"`
  (pandas 3.0.3, pyarrow 24 — mind pandas-3 API: no DataFrame.append, strict copy-on-write).
- Commit source only (templates/, engine/, scripts/, config.yml, workflows, site/odds.js|css);
  CI rebuilds site html. NEVER commit site/oddsmatrix/, data/odds_ohlcv/, or rebuilt pages.

### Tests (pytest, in-repo conventions)
1. Bucket boundary unit tests per factor (exact edges: VIX 11.99/12.00/15.00/34.99/35.00 …).
2. Forward-return alignment on a synthetic 30-bar frame with known opens/closes (assert
   fwd1/fwd5 exact values, nulls at tail, holiday-gap indifference via positional logic).
3. No-look-ahead: ATR/rel_vol denominators use only ≤t−1 data (construct a frame where
   including t changes the answer; assert it doesn't).
4. Matcher cross-check: Python reimplementation of the client match on a real built SPY
   matrix — default conditions, 10y, 1d — assert n>0 and stats equal an independent pandas
   computation to 1e-9; same for one factor-match template row.
5. Matrix JSON round-trip: schema keys, equal array lengths, dates ascending, ints only.

### Universe v1 (config.yml `odds:` block)
Index/style ETFs: SPY QQQ IWM DIA RSP; sector SPDRs XLK XLF XLE XLV XLI XLY XLP XLU XLB

ONDS if yfinance has them). Universe = config list ∩ successfully-fetched; degrade quietly.

### Verification (before PR)
- Run `scripts/build_odds.py` in the worktree (real backfill + build). Inspect
  catalog/factor_match sanity (SPY defaults n in a plausible range; spot-check a few
  matched dates against raw data).
- Local preview: serve site/ via http.server; site/data_base.js ships with the live R2
  DATA_BASE which would 404 for oddsmatrix pre-upload → for verification ONLY, temporarily
  set DATA_BASE='' in the local site/data_base.js copy (or override before load), verify,
  then `git checkout -- site/data_base.js`. Do not commit that edit.
- Headless-Chrome screenshots: both tabs + zh toggle + a second ticker (NVDA) + a low-n
  edge case — verify hero numbers equal the pytest cross-check values.
- py_compile + Jinja `Environment().parse()` + full new-test suite green + existing fast
  tests still green (`tests/test_check_nav_gap.py` as canary).

### v1 non-goals (documented in page footer roadmap)
Earnings proximity/performance + analyst-trend conditions (no PIT history in repo yet),
crypto symbols, multi-day observed patterns, NL "Ask Stanley" chat, arbitrary-combo
universe scans (needs a server or wasm+parquet shipping — candidates for v2).
