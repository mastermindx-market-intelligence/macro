# Market Ontology Meta-CEO Charter (2026-09-06)

Binding charter for the two Claude Meta-CEOs of the Market Ontology program. A cold-start
session on the Claude3 account (Meta-CEO B) can pick up half B from this file alone, plus
`origin/main` and this repo's `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`. This file does not restate CLAUDE.md
law — it points to it and adds only what is specific to this program.

Source note for the reader: this charter was compiled by a routed `drafter` session from a
frozen decisions seed written by Meta-CEO A (Claude8 session `5b29ad85-0490-42c8-b5e4-1e32b1922014`)
plus a fresh multi-file census of the repo, GitHub, and Slack state. Every seed decision in
`§0`-`§8` is reproduced as written; census facts fill in row IDs, PR states, and file paths.
Where the census could not resolve a fact, this file says `UNKNOWN` and names who resolves it
— it does not invent a value.

## §0 Authority

Chairman Chris, in the Claude8 chat on 2026-09-05 PDT (after 05:15Z on 2026-09-06 UTC), wrote:

Follow-ups in the same turn:

**What this supersedes, for this program only:** the ChatGPT CEO ("Sol", ChatGPT3
`U0BR1GQH7SB`) and the Grok Secretary transport are relieved of authority over the Market
Ontology program; every past Sol ruling, HOLD-FOR-SOL label, and READ_ONLY_ARCHAEOLOGY state on
a Market Ontology PR or lane is history, not a gate, from this override forward. This also
supersedes the 2026-08-29 hierarchy amendment's do-not-redo lines "Do not flatten the hierarchy
back into Meta-CEO -> generic coding workers" and "Do not treat Computer Use typing as pickup"
**for this program** (a receiver-side ACK is kept as a one-comment receipt — see §4). Nothing
else in CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, `research/DO_NOT_REBUILD.md`, or any other program's authority is
touched by this override.

**Chairman Chris remains final authority.** A Chairman message in ANY Claude chat (Claude3,
Claude8, or either auxiliary app) binds both Meta-CEOs immediately, overrides anything in this
charter, and does not require a permission request back.

**Timing note for the receiving session:** the most recent Sol/Root comments on macro#6819
(2026-09-06T00:10Z-00:34Z, covering PR #6890's "Stage A"/"Stage B" release procedure) predate
this override by several hours. They no longer bind. But re-read GitHub state fresh before
acting on #6890 (see §5 Wave 0) — Root's "Stage B" disarm step may have already executed between
the census and whenever you read this.

## §1 Roles

- **Meta-CEO A** = Claude8 account, Code session `5b29ad85-0490-42c8-b5e4-1e32b1922014`
  (app-realm `local_a43a5e87-f178-472b-bde0-c6f4bda22a1b`, Slack seat Claude8 `U0BS3H525NW`).
  Runs Fable in the main loop. Wrote this charter's frozen decisions.
- **Meta-CEO B** = Claude3 account (Slack seat `U0BSLFRGA79`; already hosts the F08 "Portfolio
  alerts monitoring" and F13 "OPS learning reliability Fable" sessions). B is co-equal: same
  authority, same information (this charter + `origin/main`), sovereign inside its half.
- **Auxiliary capacity** = the two other running Claude desktop apps. Either Meta-CEO may
  commission them (by typing a packet via computer-use, or by the Chairman pasting one) as
  additional lane executors. A commissioned auxiliary session ACKs with one comment on
  macro#6819 naming its session id and lane, then owns that packet to merge + live proof.
- **Workers** = workflow subagents (`builder`/sonnet, `reviewer`/opus, `designer`/opus,
  `analyst`/opus, `scout`/sonnet, `drafter`/sonnet, `debugger`/opus) per CLAUDE.md §Model
  routing. Meta-CEOs adjudicate; they do not grind code in the main loop.

## §2 Program definition and DONE

- **Backlog of record** =
  `research/market_intelligence_productization/MARKET_ONTOLOGY_F00C_GRANULAR_CLOSURE_LEDGER_2026-09-02.csv`
  (130 ids: 88 MO-PAID + 42 MO-DELTA; per lane F01=12 F02=10 F03=16 F04=9 F05=4 F06=3 F07=5
  F08=7 F09=29 F10=5 F11=6 F12=18 F13=6; dispositions NEW_BOUNDED_BUILD 46,
  UPGRADE_EXISTING_OWNER 40, PROJECTION_ONLY 20, BLOCKED_RIGHTS 7, CONTEXT_ONLY 7,
  EXACT_EQUIVALENT 5). The 1,556-row historical P1 corpus stays a separate gated denominator —
  do not import or reconstruct it (see §9).
- **Product target** = a coherent Mastermind product across Macro (mastermind-x.com, static
  site + engine, LIVE per `curl -sI https://www.mastermind-x.com/` → HTTP/2 200) and Terminal
  (app.mastermind-x.com, Next.js + Supabase, LIVE and redirecting to `/terminal`), reachable
  through the two existing nav families. NOT a clone: never copy Market Ontology proprietary
  code, text, data, assets, branding, or hidden interfaces (DNR + program do-not-redo bind).
- **DONE for the program** = every ledger row terminal with proof: NEW_BOUNDED_BUILD /
  UPGRADE_EXISTING_OWNER / PROJECTION_ONLY rows are merged AND live-verified (live URL +
  readback/screenshot in the PR body) with the ledger status updated in the same or next PR;
  BLOCKED_RIGHTS rows carry a recorded rejection naming the commercial/rights gate (a Chairman
  decision, not a build); CONTEXT_ONLY / EXACT_EQUIVALENT rows carry a pointer to the existing
  owner. **DONE for any packet** = merged + live-verified (fleet law), never "PR open".

## §3 The split (whole lanes; exclusive path ownership follows the lane)

| Lane | Half | Ledger rows | Key PRs (open, per census) | Repo weight |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F00 shared shell/nav/contract freeze + integration | A | n/a (program control) | #6819 (carrier) | macro |
| F01 Macro/Markets/Briefings | A | 12 | #6873 (hub R1), #6890 (pack-5 repair), #6826 (architecture) | macro + read-only Terminal projections |
| F02 Policy/Geo | A | 10 | #6834 (F02-X1 sanctions geography) | UNKNOWN (inferred macro via WS:MARKET-OS) |
| F03 Options/Expression | A | 16 | #6604 (Options C0 lineage, state UNKNOWN — see §10) | UNKNOWN (inferred macro, Options owner) |
| F04 Ontology/Transmission/Opportunity | A | 9 | #6872 (X1 WTI), #6809 (D2C, state UNKNOWN — see §10), #6820 (merged records) | macro (explicit PR numbers) |
| F05 Event/Impact/Catalyst | A | 4 | none open in census | UNKNOWN |
| F10 Quant/Analogs | A | 5 | #6830 (F10-X1 implication cards) | UNKNOWN |
| F01F13 Market Orientation (cross-cutting AM Edition -> Indicator Library -> Glossary, `DEC-MARKET-ONTOLOGY-MARKET-ORIENTATION-PROJECTION-2026-08-30`, currently UNPLACED) | A | n/a | none | macro (`scripts/build_aibrief.py`, `templates/aibrief.html.j2`) |
| **A subtotal** | | **56 rows + shell** | | |
| F06 Security/Ticker Workspace | B | 3 | #6831 (MSFT security_state child) | UNKNOWN (Market OS/Terminal projections implied) |
| F07 Valuation/Scenario | B | 5 | none open in census | UNKNOWN |
| F08 Portfolio/Alerts | B | 7 | #6892 (architecture freeze, not held), #6526 (badge refresh, not held) | UNKNOWN (already on Claude3) |
| F09 Capital/Ownership/Materials | B | 29 | #6793 (F09-1, cash-deal premium) | UNKNOWN |
| F11 Human Research/Thesis/RMS | B | 6 | Terminal #502 (Thesis Object migration) | macro + Terminal (Supabase) |
| F12 Team/Tenant/API/Platform | B | 18 | none open in census | UNKNOWN; Supabase-owned |
| F13 Ops/Learning/Reliability | B | 6 | #6861 (F13 capability health V1) | UNKNOWN (already on Claude3) |
| Supabase migration-ledger namespace settlement + identity/tenant contract freeze (F11/F12 depend on it) | B | n/a | Terminal #502, #507 | Terminal (charting-app) |
| **B subtotal** | | **74 rows + platform** | | |

**Shared surfaces:** A owns the Macro shell (`templates/_site_nav.html.j2`,
`_navlinks.html.j2`, `_public_nav.html.j2` family, `theme.css`/`theme.js`,
`navigation-refresh.css`, `research/MASTER_PRODUCT_DESIGN_SYSTEM_V1.md`,
`docs/DESIGN_DOCTRINE.md`, the ledger CSV's schema). B owns the Terminal shell (charting-app
`terminal/app` layout/nav), `supabase/migrations` namespace, identity/tenant/entitlement
contracts, alert delivery plumbing. A cross-half change: open the PR, label it
`meta-ceo-shared`, comment on #6819 — do NOT wait; the owning half reviews at its next wave
boundary and may follow up with its own PR. Conflicts: the surface owner decides.

**PR allocation rule** for open program PRs: a PR belongs to the half that owns its lane (by
branch name/title/files); unknown -> A adjudicates within one wave. See §5 for the concrete
Wave 0 table built from this rule.

## §4 Coordination protocol (minimal)

- **Running log** = comments on macro#6819 (git carrier). Each Meta-CEO posts ONE comment per
  wave boundary: wave id, packets shipped (PR, merge sha, live URL), packets failed, ledger rows
  closed, next wave. One comment per takeover of a previously held PR ("Meta-CEO A taking PR #N
  under the Chairman override; owner session X may stop"). Optionally mirror to Slack root
  `C0BSBM78V1N/1788510607.305039` — Slack is a record, not a gate.
- **Durable state** = `agentos/handoffs/MARKET-ONTOLOGY-META-CEO-A-<date>.md` and
  `...-META-CEO-B-<date>.md`, each written ONLY by its owner at wave boundaries (never edit the
  other's), plus the ledger CSV row edits (row-level; rebase on conflict). No new stores.
- **Held-PR takeover procedure:**
  1. Fresh-read the PR (state, head, checks, last comment).
  2. If a live session commented on it within 2h and shows in-flight work, post the takeover
     comment and wait ONE wave (not longer); otherwise take it now.
  3. Opus `reviewer` pass on the diff against fresh `origin/main`.
  4. Fix blockers via `builder`.
  5. Mark Ready, `gh pr edit --add-label merge-on-green`, wait for CONCLUDED checks,
     squash-merge, live-verify.
  6. Comment the merge sha + live proof on #6819.
  Never close a held PR as "superseded" without a diff against fresh main proving the content
  already landed.
- **Decisions:** the half owning the lane rules; cross-half -> both, A tiebreaks on Macro
  surfaces, B on Terminal/platform; a Chairman message overrides both. Every durable choice ->
  DEC record in the same PR; every verified non-obvious fact -> DSC.
- **No waiting protocols** (for this program only): no HOLD-FOR-SOL, no
  READ_ONLY_ARCHAEOLOGY as a lane state, no PICKUP_ACK/START ceremony beyond the one comment, no
  DECISION_REQUEST to Sol, no exact-root Slack re-reads before every act (a fresh read of GitHub
  state before every push/merge is still required — that is ordinary fleet law, not a Sol
  ceremony).

## §5 Waves

### Wave 0 (both, immediately): heal main and release the held backlog

PR allocation table (13-PR tight census set + #6890 + the three named Terminal PRs; state as
captured by the census, re-read fresh before acting):

| PR | Half | Current state (census) | Wave 0 action |
|---|---|---|---|
| macro#6890 | A (F01) | **MERGED** as `7db17edb53d1141abeff2f9ef8846b6a4771873c` at 2026-09-06T01:33Z (Root released its hold at 01:33Z); main proven green on that merge by ci.yml run 34005007960 (workflow_dispatch, success) | Nothing to do — main is healed. Every later PR rebases onto this base. |
| macro#6873 | A (F01) | Draft, `HOLD-FOR-SOL — do not merge`, head `b7d237f0`, 0 reviews; collides with #6872 on `.github/ci/legacy-jobs.yml`, `app/deploy/Caddyfile`, `config/site_access.yml`, `tests/test_site_access_boundary.py` | Merge second, right after #6890 (heals pack-5 too). Global admission (NaN/True finite-number obligation) stays open per the F00 continuity reconciliation — resolve or explicitly re-scope before Ready. |
| macro#6872 | A (F04) | Draft, `HOLD-FOR-SOL`, head `ba62f5a5`, "PARTIAL / BUILT_NOT_PROVEN" | Rebase onto #6873 once it merges (shared-file collision above). Owes a corrected B-1 body + a RED-first nightly-hook test before Ready. |
| macro#6865 | A | Draft, `DRAFT / HOLD-FOR-SOL / SOURCE_LAW_CANDIDATE / SPEC_ONLY`, head `9f04ee4b`; first Opus review `5120047737` still CHANGES_REQUESTED, undismissed | A closes or disposes honestly (repaired but not approved; do not self-approve a candidate law). |
| macro#6604 | A (F03) | OPEN, Draft, head `7cc1b336`, title `records(options): Options Intelligence C0 consolidated masterplan` (re-read 2026-09-06): a records/masterplan carrier, not a build | A reviews and merges it as the F03 masterplan of record (records only); until merged, F03 Wave-1 packets stay CONTINGENT (§10). |
| macro#6809 | A (F04) | OPEN, Draft, head `44c27dd3`, title `feat(theme-graph): materialize THS memberships from PIT history` (re-read 2026-09-06; "D2C" was Sol's carrier name, not the title); last known REQUEST_REPAIR with review `5110800144` | A runs the release workflow on it (independent opus review first); do not absorb into F04 X1 without that review. |
| macro#6861 | B (F13) | Draft, `HOLD-FOR-F13 — do not merge`; release condition named as "independent non-author Opus review PASS + F13 principal + Sol release" | B runs the named review itself (Sol release is no longer required, §0) and takes it to merge. |
| macro#6834 | A (F02) | Draft, `DRAFT / HOLD-FOR-SOL`, head `5d540ba`; PR's own file list hit the GraphQL 50-file cap, so its true diff may be larger than captured | A takes over per the held-PR procedure; re-pull the full file list before reviewing. |
| macro#6831 | B (F06) | Draft, `OPEN / DRAFT / HOLD-FOR-SOL / REVIEW_APPROVED / BUILT_NOT_PROVEN / PRODUCTION_INERT`, head `fca73b7` | Already review-approved — B verifies the approval still applies to the current head, then Ready/merge/live-verify. |
| macro#6830 | A (F10) | Draft, `HOLD-FOR-SOL — DRAFT — DO NOT MERGE`, head `693f6dd` | A takes over per the held-PR procedure. |
| macro#6826 | A (F01) | Draft, `OPEN / DRAFT / HOLD-FOR-SOL`, head `58e8cbb` | A takes over; note this is architecture-only (F01's 12/12 workspace suite already merged via #6836-#6849) — confirm it is not stale before reviving. |
| macro#6810 | A (adjudicate; program-wide) | Draft, `RECORDS_ONLY / DRAFT / HOLD-FOR-SOL`, head `2292068` ("checkpoint ontology continuation control state") | A disposes within Wave 0 per the unknown-lane rule (§3) — this is a continuation-control record, not a numbered lane. |
| macro#6793 | B (F09) | Draft, `HOLD-FOR-SOL — DRAFT. Do not mark ready, do not arm merge-on-green, do not merge.`, head `29b60c1`; maps to ledger row MO-PAID-064 / MO-DELTA-023 (cash-deal premium, EDGAR tender filings) | B takes over per the held-PR procedure — this hold no longer binds (§0). |
| macro#6595 | A (adjudicate; program-wide) | Draft, `DRAFT / HOLD-FOR-SOL / RECORDS-ONLY / NO LANE START / NO PRODUCT EFFECT` (Fable root-seat topology reconciliation) | A disposes as a records-only close; no product effect to release. |
| macro#6892 | B (F08) | **MERGED** (merge commit `e0d97381c40a7f148d5336cbc3c93dc07dacacfe`, f08 architecture freeze, records only) | Nothing to do; records only, no live surface. |
| macro#6526 | B (F08) | OPEN, **Draft** (re-checked 2026-09-06 via `gh api graphql`: isDraft=true), no HOLD text, "refresh Portfolio badge after authoritative A1B reread" (2026-08-27) | B takes it through the release workflow (review -> Ready -> merge-on-green -> merge -> live proof) or closes it with a diff-against-main proof that it already landed. |
| terminal#490 | B | Draft, "fix: host existing Brain in Analysis shell", HOLD status unchecked by the census | B census's this PR before disposing (title carries no HOLD marker, but confirm). |
| terminal#502 | B (F11) | Draft, `[F11-1][HOLD]`, adds `supabase/migrations/0011_thesis_objects.sql` (private versioned Thesis Object) | B resolves the migration-namespace collision with #507 (see next row) before Ready. |
| terminal#507 | B | Open, labels `merge-on-green`,`merge-blocked`, adds `supabase/migrations/0011_analytics_eid.sql` (CA1A envelope-v1 identity) | **Numbering collision with #502** — both open PRs add a file named `0011_*.sql`. B settles which merges first and renumbers the loser before either lands (see §10 Supabase namespace question). |

*Note on an internal tension in the frozen seed:* §5's original prose lists "#6830, #6834,
#6861, #6826, #6810" under Meta-CEO B's Wave 0 actions ("remaining B-lane holds... by lane"),
but §3's explicit PR-allocation rule assigns #6830/#6834/#6826 to F10/F02/F01 (A's lanes) and
only #6861 is genuinely F13 (B's lane); #6810 is program-wide, not lane-specific. The table
above resolves this using §3's rule (the more specific, explicitly-named allocation law) —
lane ownership decides the half, not the sentence in §5. Either Meta-CEO may re-open this in a
DEC if they read it differently; until then, treat the table above as the working allocation.

Also in Wave 0: **B settles the Supabase migration-namespace collision** (both charting-app PRs
#502 and #507 independently claim `0011_*.sql`; per `agentos/discoveries/DSC-TERMINAL-HAS-NO-MIGRATION-LEDGER.md`,
Terminal's Supabase project has no `supabase_migrations` schema — files are hand-applied,
order-independent, source-of-record only). B greps every open charting-app PR for
`supabase/migrations` before assigning the next free number, merges one, and renumbers the
other in the same wave.

### Wave 1 (both): the first two independently useful verticals per lane

Copied from `agentos/handoffs/MARKET-ONTOLOGY-F00-FULL-SITE-RESTART-INTEGRATOR-2026-09-04.md`
L115-125 (the frozen critical-path seed), with ledger-row detail filled in from the F00C CSV.

**A also freezes the interim shared-contract list** (same file, L105-113) as the binding
contract page for this charter:

1. **Page shell/navigation** — only the two existing nav families; route additions follow the
   design-system archetype registry; no third header.
2. **Evidence/source/time/null/correction** — K1 EvidenceRef/EvidenceBlock/EvidenceRecipe
   contracts are the binding form; corrections are typed states.
3. **Authority** — the ledger's `authority_ceiling` column binds; LLMs never originate market
   facts, scores, or escalations.
4. **No-rebuild** — each lane's durable-handoff `do_not_redo` binds as written.
5. **Identity/tenant** — Stock Identity + Data OS for securities; Supabase auth for users; no
   new identity planes.

Every packet below runs through `Workflow({name:'marketontology-vertical-build', ...})` (§6).

#### Meta-CEO A packets

**A-F02-1**
- id: `A-F02-1` · lane: F02 · title: Base map + OFAC sanctions overlay
- repo: macro · kind: engine+ui
- ledger_rows: `MO-DELTA-031`, `MO-PAID-008`
- spec_sources: `engine/qbus.py` family (F02's stated owner engine, no direct hit found by the
  census — greenfield); `research/DO_NOT_REBUILD.md` (no second geospatial store)
- owned_paths: none existing named by the ledger (`real_producer: NONE` for both rows) —
  the `analyst` spec stage proposes the exact new engine module + template
- entry_points: UNKNOWN — no "Policy"/"Geo" nav item found in the current
  `templates/_navlinks.html.j2` census; the spec stage must place this under an existing nav
  family, not invent a third header
- acceptance (ledger `acceptance_test`): "a rendered base map with an OFAC sanctions overlay
  joined through an existing store"; missing_contract_or_proof: "base map + 4 layers; only
  base-map + sanctions overlay (OFAC public lists) are rights-clear" — chokepoint/military/
  satellite layers stay CONTEXT_ONLY behind the rights docket (do not build them here)
- live_url: TBD in spec (new page under an existing nav family)

  state-machine store (TBD at build per the ledger row)
- entry_points: `policy_watch.html` route (existing page — confirm exact nav placement in spec)
- acceptance: "a jurisdiction-scoped policy item advances through deterministic lifecycle
  states on a real store, rendered"; missing_contract_or_proof: "deterministic
  proposal->passage->enactment->enforcement state machine"
- live_url: TBD (existing `policy_watch.html` page, updated)

  its paired row MO-DELTA-001, same substrate)
- spec_sources: `engine/chronicle/spine.py`
- owned_paths: `engine/chronicle/spine.py` and its consumer template (spec proposes exact file)
- entry_points: UNKNOWN — confirm in spec whether an existing "Market-Feed" surface exists
  (this is exactly what MO-DELTA-001 below asks)
- acceptance: per MO-PAID-017's own row (not fetched this pass — spec stage must read the row
  directly before building)
- live_url: TBD

**A-F05-2**
- id: `A-F05-2` · lane: F05 · title: Market-Feed alias confirmation
- repo: macro · kind: analysis+ui
- ledger_rows: `MO-DELTA-001`

- acceptance: "MO-PAID-017 interface confirmed to serve (or explicitly not serve) a
  Market-Feed surface"
- live_url: TBD (fold-in, not a new page)

**A-F10-1**
- id: `A-F10-1` · lane: F10 · title: Implication-card output contract over two estimators
- repo: macro · kind: engine+ui
- ledger_rows: `MO-PAID-039` (cites prior PR #6822, status UNKNOWN in this census — fresh-read
  before assuming it is still open)
- spec_sources: `engine/synthetic_control.py`, `engine/seasonality/event_study.py` (both
  "pure unwired estimators" per the ledger)
- owned_paths: `engine/synthetic_control.py`, `engine/seasonality/event_study.py`, plus one new
  card-schema/UI surface (spec proposes exact file)
- entry_points: "a routed UI" (unnamed in the ledger — spec stage picks the nearest existing
  research page in the correct nav family)
- acceptance: "an implication card renders in a routed UI from estimator output"; this is an
  ADJUDICATED single child with MO-DELTA-016 (not separately listed here — read that row before
  building)
- live_url: TBD

**A-F10-2**
- id: `A-F10-2` · lane: F10 · title: One additional econometric family
- repo: macro · kind: engine
- ledger_rows: `MO-DELTA-015`
- spec_sources: `synthetic_control.py` (matched_k v0), `event_study.py` — 9 of ~11 econometric
  families confirmed absent by grep; 2 of 11 exist in code
- owned_paths: one new family module under the same engine directory (principal scopes which
  family ships first — the ledger names no single next child yet)
- entry_points: none named (research_only per the ledger's authority_ceiling)
- acceptance: "one additional family implemented, callable, tested"
- live_url: n/a (research/CLI surface, not a page, unless the spec proposes one)

**A-F03-1 / A-F03-2 (contingent on §10 resolving #6604's state first)**
- ids: `A-F03-1` (`MO-PAID-076`, Structure Builder), `A-F03-2` (`MO-DELTA-033`/`MO-PAID-070`,
  catalyst->exposure->structure workflow modules)
- repo: macro · kind: engine+ui
- All three rows carry `next_bounded_child: ABSORBED-BY #6604` — the F03 commissioning owner.
  **Do not build these independently of #6604's own drafting session** until A has fresh-read
  #6604's actual state (§10). If #6604 is stale/abandoned, A converts these into normal Wave 1
  packets with `#6604` removed as a dependency and records that choice as a DEC.
- spec_sources: ThetaData chain/flow (named as available in the ledger; exact module UNKNOWN —
  spec stage locates it), catalyst/event feed (binding source UNKNOWN)
- acceptance: per each row's `acceptance_test` (none machine-checkable yet per the ledger —
  "n/a — #6604 drafts it")

A's Wave 1 total: **6 concrete packets** (A-F02-1, A-F02-2, A-F05-1, A-F05-2, A-F10-1, A-F10-2),
plus 2 contingent F03 packets pending §10.

*F01 and F04 note:* F01's 12/12 workspace suite is already merged (PRs #6836, #6843-#6849 per
the census); F04's WTI vertical is already built but held (#6872). Wave 1 work on F01/F04 is
therefore **close-out of the Wave 0 PRs above**, not new packets — do not open a second F01 or
F04 vertical while #6873/#6872/#6890/#6826 are unresolved.

#### Meta-CEO B packets

**B-F08-1**
- id: `B-F08-1` · lane: F08 · title: Alert preferences UI/API + mailer wiring
- repo: macro · kind: engine+ui
- ledger_rows: `MO-PAID-085`
- spec_sources: `app/account_prefs.py` (no alert prefs today), `engine/portfolio_digest.py`
  ("SEND PATH IS NOT WIRED, DELIBERATELY"), `app/mailer.py` (existing, unwired)
- owned_paths: `app/account_prefs.py`, `engine/portfolio_digest.py`, `app/mailer.py`, plus the
  settings template that surfaces the preference
- entry_points: existing `alerts.html` (Alert Command Center, live in the US nav menu) and/or
  an account/settings page — confirm exact route in spec
- acceptance: "a set preference causes an actual send on the next matching alert"; named
  integrity gap to respect: `scripts/build_bonds.py:1433-1440` falls back silently on a failed
  nightly, so a stale alert state can render as current — this packet's spec must not repeat
  that pattern (per `research/MARKET_ONTOLOGY_F08_ARCHAEOLOGY_CENSUS_2026-09-04.md`)
- live_url: `https://www.mastermind-x.com/alerts.html` (existing page, extended)

**B-F08-2**
- id: `B-F08-2` · lane: F08 · title: Event/scenario -> touched-position mapping
- repo: macro · kind: engine+ui
- ledger_rows: `MO-PAID-028`, `MO-DELTA-042` (ADJUDICATED single child — build together)
- spec_sources: A1A/A1B holdings truth (Portfolio state authority, PROVEN_LIVE per PR #6508);
  `engine/alerts.py`, `engine/alert_triage.py` (existing rule engine + display)
- owned_paths: `engine/alerts.py`, `engine/alert_triage.py`, plus a new event-schema module
  (direction/mechanism/timeframe/invalidation) per MO-DELTA-042's requirement
- entry_points: routed page over existing Portfolio/Alert surfaces (confirm exact route in spec)
- acceptance: "an event object resolves to the user positions it touches on a routed page"
- live_url: TBD (extension of the Alert Command Center or Portfolio page)

**B-F09-1**
- id: `B-F09-1` · lane: F09 · title: HY/IG credit-window gating leg
- repo: macro · kind: engine+ui
- ledger_rows: `MO-PAID-060` (paired with `MO-DELTA-019`, not separately detailed here)
- spec_sources: `engine/ipo_radar.py` (`window_context()` at L79), `collectors/ipo_calendar.py`
- owned_paths: extension of `engine/ipo_radar.py`'s `window_context()` pattern to HY/IG credit
  windows (a scoped-down build per the ledger, not a new engine)
- entry_points: UNKNOWN — nearest existing IPO/credit surface; confirm in spec
- acceptance: "a follow-on/HY-IG window gate exists parallel to the IPO leg"; named gap: "deal-
  calendar (upcoming IPO) source not found in repo" (UNVERIFIED per the ledger)
- live_url: TBD
- *Run this only after B has taken over and merged #6793 (F09-1, MO-PAID-064/MO-DELTA-023) in
  Wave 0* — MO-PAID-060 is F09's *second* vertical, not its first.

**B-F11-1**
- id: `B-F11-1` · lane: F11 · title: Thesis Condition monitor -> notification
- repo: macro (+ Terminal for the Thesis Object store via #502) · kind: engine+ui
- ledger_rows: `MO-PAID-047`
- spec_sources: `engine/falsifier_tripwires.py` (production tripwire machinery; latch law
  verified: FIRED is sticky, un-fired only by version bump); consumers `moat_falsifiers`,
  `theme_thesis`, `research_factory`
- owned_paths: project a user monitor over the *existing* tripwire state machine — do not
  build a second engine; wire the notification through the F08 delivery path (B-F08-1)
- entry_points: UNKNOWN — no RMS/thesis nav item found in the current site census; confirm
  placement in spec (do not create a third nav family)
- acceptance: "a subscribed Thesis Condition FIRED transition triggers a notification via the
  F08 delivery path"; **house law**: user-facing text never says "falsifier" (CLAUDE.md
  §Epistemics + #3821 ruling) — use "windows, not certainties" language instead
- live_url: TBD
- *Depends on* Terminal #502 (Thesis Object migration) landing first — resolve the Supabase
  0011 namespace collision (Wave 0) before this packet's build stage.

**B-F12-1**
- id: `B-F12-1` · lane: F12 · title: Tenancy foundation (team_id-scoped membership)
- repo: Terminal (charting-app; Supabase-owned) · kind: data+engine
- ledger_rows: `MO-PAID-051` (coordinated with `MO-PAID-081` invitation flow, which the ledger
  marks ABSORBED-BY this same foundation)
- spec_sources: none exist today — "NONE (no team_id/tenant_id/seat_limit/workspace_id anywhere
  in app/ or engine/)" per the ledger; coordinate with WS:MARKET-OS's A2-A6 host wave rather
  than duplicating it
- owned_paths: new `supabase/migrations/00NN_tenancy_foundation.sql` (settle the namespace
  first, Wave 0), plus the Terminal API routes that read/write `team_id`
- entry_points: internal (no public route required for this row alone)
- acceptance: "a team_id-scoped membership row is created/read by a live route"
- live_url: n/a (platform row; a live Terminal API route counts as proof)
- **Gate**: `research/DO_NOT_REBUILD.md` / `DEC-CROSS-REPO-CONTRACT-GOVERNANCE-FEDERATED-NO-RUNTIME`
  forbids this becoming a cross-repo traffic middleman — keep it inside Terminal's own stack.

**B-F13-1**
- id: `B-F13-1` · lane: F13 · title: Public glossary over the existing vocabulary
- repo: macro · kind: ui
- ledger_rows: `MO-DELTA-011`
- spec_sources: `docs/site_semantics/` (6 files, the Context Index source),
  `scripts/context_index_query.py` (internal query tool, not the page itself)
- owned_paths: one new `templates/glossary.html.j2` + paired `site/glossary.html` (plain-copy
  pair rule applies if not a `.j2`-only render) + the static content it renders
- entry_points: new nav entry under the existing "Research" menu family (do not invent a third
  header) — confirm exact placement in spec
- acceptance: "a public page lists >=50 defined terms from the existing vocabulary"
- live_url: `https://www.mastermind-x.com/glossary.html` (proposed; confirm in spec)
- *Note:* `MO-PAID-088`'s `/help` + changelog half of this same "F01/F13 cheap-projection
  batch" is already shipped — PR #6828 merged a governed public help directory (per the census
  merged-PR list, `[F13-X1][HOLD-FOR-F00] Add governed public help directory`, merged
  2026-09-05T08:44:06Z). Do not re-build `/help`; this packet is the glossary half only.

**F06 and F07 note:** both lanes' first two verticals are explicitly `DEFER`red in the ledger —
F06's `MO-PAID-021`/`MO-DELTA-002` wait on MO-PAID-020's renderer/CIK repair (§10) and on F07's
valuation inputs; F07's `MO-PAID-022`/`035`/`026`/`037` wait on a Chairman/Sol valuation-source
rights ruling (F00B fanout item 3). B's Wave 1 action for these two lanes is to **resolve the
dependency** (route MO-PAID-020 per §10; get the valuation-source ruling from the Chairman) —
not to build a vertical against an unresolved dependency. #6831 (MSFT security_state, Wave 0)
is F06's real near-term product motion.

B's Wave 1 total: **4 buildable concrete packets** (B-F08-1, B-F08-2, B-F09-1, B-F11-1) plus
2 more with concrete file paths (B-F12-1, B-F13-1) — 6 in total, plus F06/F07 dependency-
resolution actions.

### Wave 2..N: close remaining ledger rows per lane in ledger order

NEW_BOUNDED_BUILD and UPGRADE_EXISTING_OWNER rows with proven-live owners first,
PROJECTION_ONLY next; BLOCKED_RIGHTS rows get a recorded rejection naming the gate;
`<=6` packets per workflow run (the script itself hard-caps at 8 — see §6); one workflow run
per lane batch; the Meta-CEO adjudicates results, updates the ledger and its handoff, posts the
wave comment, launches the next wave. **Program ends when the ledger has zero non-terminal
rows and both handoffs say COMPLETE with live proof links.**

## §6 Execution recipe (workflow)

**Script:** `.claude/workflows/marketontology_vertical_build.js`
(`meta.name = 'marketontology-vertical-build'`), invoked as:

```
Workflow({
  name: 'marketontology-vertical-build',
  args: { ceo: 'A'|'B', wave: '<id>', packets: [ /* <= 8, script hard cap */ ] }
})
```

**Packet shape** (exactly as the script destructures it):

```
{
  id, lane, title, repo: 'macro'|'terminal', kind: 'ui'|'engine'|'data'|'records',
  ledger_rows: ['MO-PAID-0xx', ...], spec_sources: [...], owned_paths: [...],
  entry_points: [...], acceptance: [...], live_url: '<expected>'
}
```

The script throws if `packets` is empty/missing, and throws above 8 packets (charter guidance
above is `<=6`; the script's hard ceiling is 8 — keep to 6 in practice for review load).

**Stages** (each packet flows independently through the pipeline):

1. **Spec** — `designer` (kind `ui`) or `analyst` (otherwise) freezes the packet into an
   implementable spec: exact files, markup/CSS or data contract, tests, entry-point wiring,
   live URL, and (for UI) both dark and light theme treatments. Schema requires
   `spec_markdown`, `owned_paths`, `sources_read`.
2. **Build** — `builder`, isolated sparse worktree. Fetches the packet's default branch
   (`main` for macro, `master` for terminal), opens `git checkout -B claude/mo-<ceo>-<wave>-<id>`,
   implements, runs the touched tests, produces evidence crops for UI (dark/light x EN/ZH x
   1440/390), commits, pushes, opens the PR (title `[MO-<CEO><WAVE>] <id>: <title>`), arms
   `merge-on-green`.
3. **Review** — `reviewer` (opus) attacks the diff against fresh `origin/<default-branch>`;
   verdict `PASS`/`FIX_REQUIRED`/`REJECT` with blockers/majors/minors, each citing file:line.
4. **Fix** — only runs if verdict is not `PASS`/`REJECT`; `builder` repairs blockers+majors on
   the same branch, then one re-review.
5. **Ship** — `builder`, low effort: preflights `gh api rate_limit`, waits CONCLUDED checks
   with exactly one watcher (`gh pr checks <n> --watch --interval 150`), squash-merges on
   green (or records the sweeper's merge), then live-verifies — macro via the shared
   `render.yml` lane (watch, never cancel/re-run), Terminal via polling
   `https://app.mastermind-x.com` post-`terminal-build.sh`.

A packet that fails `spec` (BLOCKED) or is `REJECT`ed at review does not proceed; the pipeline
records it and moves on. The workflow returns
`{ ceo, wave, shipped, total, packets: [{ id, lane, ledger_rows, spec, pr, pr_url, verdict,
blockers_open, merged, merge_sha, live_verified, live_proof, gaps }] }` — the Meta-CEO reads
this summary to update the ledger and write the wave handoff comment.

**Takeover procedure** for a PR opened by a prior session (not by this workflow): see §4's
held-PR takeover procedure — it is identical whether the PR came from this workflow or from an
earlier program phase (Sol/Codex/etc.).

**Standing gates inline in every packet** (spawn-handoff law, CLAUDE.md): fresh end-to-end
happy path, zero manual workarounds; UI packets post dark/light x EN/ZH x 1440/390 crops in the
PR body and pass `check_design_system.py --mode enforce-added`,
`check_runtime_style_injection.py`, `check_ui_visual_evidence.py`, `check_template_site_sync.py`;
entry points wired in the existing nav family; nulls printed not hidden; no LLM-originated
signals/scores; no trading authority; tests added/updated; GitHub annotations start the line.

### 6.w Release workflow for held PRs (Wave 0)

`.claude/workflows/marketontology_release_held_pr.js`, invoked by name once macro#6894 is merged:
`Workflow({name:'marketontology-release-held-pr', args:{ceo:'B', repo:'macro', prs:[6793, 6831, 6861, 6526]}})`
(sequential: takeover comment -> rebase onto fresh base in a GC-visible sparse worktree ->
opus review -> fix + re-review -> ship). The ship stage runs
`.claude/workflows/release_hold_text.py <pr>` ONCE: it strips the title marker, rewrites every
body line the sweeper would classify as a hold, posts a `HOLD-RELEASED` comment, marks Ready,
swaps `merge-blocked` for `merge-on-green`, and re-verifies with the sweeper's own
`scripts/merge_on_green.recorded_hold` (exit 2 if a hold is still recorded). This exists because
`scripts/merge_on_green.py` refuses any PR whose title, body or comments carry a hold marker at
line start, and only a later comment starting with `HOLD-RELEASED` clears a comment-carried hold.
Every stage prompt verifies the Chairman-override DEC on `origin/main` (fallback: the charter
branch) with `git show` before writing.

### 6.x Worker budget law (measured 2026-09-06, binding for both halves)

Workflow subagents are cut off at **exactly 30 tool calls with no return** (two Opus reviewers
and one drafter died this way on 2026-09-06; the orchestrator sees only "completed without
calling StructuredOutput"). Consequences: every stage prompt carries a HARD BUDGET (spec 20,
build 26, review 22, fix 24, ship 20); packets are sized so a builder can implement, test, push
and open the PR inside 26 calls (split bigger work into more packets); builders checkpoint WIP
with a push and return PARTIAL + `remaining_steps`, and `marketontology_vertical_build.js`
resumes them on the same branch up to three times; reviewers write the diff to a file once and
read it in ranges; every worker appends progress notes to `$TMPDIR/mo-progress-*.md` so a
cut-off still leaves evidence. A workflow that dies with "subagent completed without calling
StructuredOutput" is a budget failure, not a refusal — read the agent transcript under the
workflow's directory before assuming nothing happened (the 2026-09-06 #6834 takeover had
succeeded and pushed before its reviewer was cut).

## §7 Laws retained and Sol-era rules repealed

**Retained in full (pointer list; do not restate):** CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md in full (ship loop
incl. merge on CONCLUDED checks, merge-on-green, quota, model routing + ROUTE registry, sparse
worktrees, navigation source-of-truth, design doctrine + theme art direction,
epistemics/gauntlet, instrument-is-not-market-verdict, annotations, Agent OS hygiene);
`research/DO_NOT_REBUILD.md`; each lane handoff's `do_not_redo` unless refuted with evidence in
a DEC; K1 EvidenceRef/EvidenceBlock/EvidenceRecipe contracts; Stock Identity + Data OS +
Supabase auth as the only identity planes; no proprietary copying; no trade/transfer execution
ever (safety rule, not repealable); Supabase DDL only through reviewed migration files in the
settled namespace.

**Repealed for this program only, per the Chairman override in §0:**
- Sol (ChatGPT CEO) and the Grok Secretary transport hold no authority over Market Ontology;
  their past rulings are history, not gates.
- Every HOLD-FOR-SOL label/comment on a Market Ontology PR listed in §5 no longer blocks a
  merge — the Meta-CEO who owns the lane may take it over per §4's procedure. (`DEC:SOL-HOLD-IS-A-MERGE-BARRIER`
  still governs every OTHER program in this repo; it is not repealed generally.)
- READ_ONLY_ARCHAEOLOGY is not a valid lane state for this program going forward.
- PICKUP_ACK/START ceremony is reduced to the one-comment ACK in §4; no DECISION_REQUEST posts
  to Sol; no exact-root Slack re-read is required before every act (ordinary GitHub-state
  freshness checks before push/merge still apply — that is fleet law, not a Sol ceremony).
- The 2026-08-29 hierarchy amendment's "flatten the hierarchy" and "Computer Use typing is not
  pickup" do-not-redo lines are superseded for this program (§0).

### 7.x Chairman product law (2026-09-06): front-end clarity

Chairman Chris, same day: "the previously built 14 page market feature was great on the backend but
its front end was not integrated well ... we want to keep it user friendly and we need these features
to be useful on the front end. So we should retain this for the other sections as well as fix up the
14 pages we made already and combine them into one interface dashboard page. see marketontology's
dashboard, theirs is super nice."

Binding for both halves, every surface: plain words; one-line stance per module ("so what do I do",
even when the honest answer is "watch, do not chase"); technicals and internal names demoted to
hover/details; no machine text (raw slugs, internal state names, untranslated stat names, bare
timestamps); no walls of text; honest nulls in plain words ("Not available yet" + why); bilingual
EN/ZH; dark = command center, light = research workspace. Reviewers reject any surface a non-quant
customer could not read in ten seconds. The Sol-era candidate law in macro#6865 ("product admission
and complexity-containment") is adopted in substance by this clause; its PR is disposed as records.

Flagship consequence for half A: the fourteen `macro_*` workspaces (merged via #6836-#6849) and the
#6873 hub become ONE command-style dashboard page (persistent section sidebar, the existing product
top nav untouched, a plain-word state strip with as-of and freshness, module panels with one stance
line each, honest-null panels, EN/ZH), tracked as packets A-F01-CMD-1..n in the A handoff.
Reference pattern only, never copied: sidebar of sections, top product tabs, state strip, module chips,
"no data yet" panel with the reason, an analyst entry point.

## §8 Pickup prompt for Meta-CEO B

Verbatim block (from the frozen seed; file paths adjusted only for accuracy against what this
drafting task actually produced):

> "You are Meta-CEO B of the Market Ontology program on the Claude3 account, co-equal with
> Meta-CEO A (Claude8 session 5b29ad85). Chairman Chris overrode the ChatGPT CEO on 2026-09-05

> `agentos/handoffs/MARKET-ONTOLOGY-META-CEO-AB-CHARTER-2026-09-06.md` and
> `agentos/decisions/DEC-CHAIRMAN-OVERRIDE-CLAUDE-META-CEO-REGIME-2026-09-06.md`; all three shipped

> `.claude/workflows/marketontology_vertical_build.js`,
> `.claude/workflows/marketontology_release_held_pr.js` and

> opus review -> fix -> Ready -> merge-on-green -> merge -> live proof), then the Terminal
> PRs (#490, #502, #507 first) with `repo:'terminal'`; (5) run Wave
> 1 with `Workflow({name:'marketontology-vertical-build', args:{ceo:'B', wave:'B1',
> packets:[...]}})` using the packets in charter §5/§9; (6) write
> `agentos/handoffs/MARKET-ONTOLOGY-META-CEO-B-<date>.md` at each wave boundary and post the
> wave comment; keep going wave after wave until half B's ledger rows are all terminal with
> live proof. Never wait for Sol; never ask the Chairman for permission; fleet law in
> CLAUDE.md still binds; ultracode is on — orchestrate with workflows, adjudicate in the main
> loop."

## §9 Danger areas and do-not-redo union

### 9.1 Program-wide do-not-redo (deduped union, source noted)

- Never create a third/second Market Ontology workstream, lifecycle, queue, identity/evidence/
  graph/financial/portfolio/thesis/tenant/API/job/grading/correction/learning/scheduler/
  runner/cleanup/retry plane. [multiple F00-family handoffs, 2026-08-26 through 09-05]
- Never literal-clone/copy Market Ontology proprietary code/data/corpora/assets/branding/
  credentials/hidden interfaces. [2026-08-26 program handoff; F00-META-CEO-PRODUCT-RESET]
- Never treat context/research parity as trading/rank/gate/size/entry authority without the
  promotion gauntlet. [2026-08-26 program handoff]
- Never reconstruct the retained 1,556-row/460-finding P1 corpus from model memory; admission
  is byte-exact via the open F00A gate only. [F00-PARITY-CONTROL; multiple later handoffs]
- Never mint replacement/substitute operation keys for F01-F13 lanes already assigned.
  [F00-F13-FANOUT-MANIFEST; F00-FULL-SITE-RESTART]
- Never infer Fable/worker execution, pickup, or ACK from Slack DELIVERY_ONLY visibility,
  Linear status, GitHub review request, PR merge, or an F00 records merge alone. [k2c;
  sol-final; F04-EXPLORER-RETURN-RECONCILIATION]
- Merged is not accepted — for OTHER programs, always read a HOLD carrier at its acceptance
  state, not its merge state. For THIS program, §0/§7 repeal the Sol-acceptance requirement,
  but "merged" still is not "live-verified" (§2 DONE). [F00B-CROSSWALK; COVERAGE-C0]
- Never recommission or duplicate K2-C or K3-D (bound to PR #6498/#6533, separate canonical
  commissions). [2026-08-26 program; pickup; COVERAGE-C0]
- Never absorb F01-F13 implementation carriers into F00; F00 is program control, not a serial
  approval hop or the implementer. [F00-PARITY-CONTROL]
- Never resume the quarantined F00 UUID `1727abca-4b22-4106-a498-6b83ad223a73` or old F01 UUID
  `550dc8b0`; do not re-ACK/re-START any already-bound lane session id (F01 `dd51ef8f`, F04
  `d6317c9b`, F05 `cc2d9d31`, F06 `03200f5b`, F09 `641ca8f7`, F10 `9c9ac628`, F11 `d937f8bd`,
  F12 `local_abf9f882`, F03 `local_cc5baa49`). [F00-META-CEO-PRODUCT-RESET;
  F00-CONTINUITY-RECONCILIATION]
- Sparse worktrees omit `site/`/`data/`/`mockups/` — absence there is a worktree-profile
  artifact, never capability evidence. [F00-PARITY-CONTROL; COVERAGE-C0]
- Rights-gated rows (military/maritime/satellite/chokepoint/deal-flow/sovereign/
  BLOCKED_RIGHTS) must never be commissioned as builds before explicit Chairman/commercial
  gates. [F00-PARITY-CONTROL; COVERAGE-C2]
- Fast-moving main can go stale under a records-only PR proof; re-check current base before
  merge. [2026-08-28 granular; CODEX-WORK-TRANSITION]
- Never mass-stop the fleet or centralize all execution into one provider account/subscription.
  [F00-META-CEO-PRODUCT-RESET]
- Never fabricate receiver capacity, OPEN_PICKUP, ACK, START, watcher, or RuntimeBinding.
  [POST-TIMEOUT-COMPLETION; POST-TIMEOUT-EXECUTION-ADMISSION]
- Never call CI green/merge/schema-apply/runner-online/screenshots "product acceptance" —
  production proof requires an actual working consumer. [2026-08-26 program;
  POST-TIMEOUT-EXECUTION-ADMISSION]

### 9.2 Per-lane do-not-redo (one line each, source = that lane's 2026-08-26 handoff)

- **F01**: no new macro data store/source registry/identity plane/event plane/ranker/alert

  source scheduler/operator control plane; no universal analyst/feature score conflating
  research quality/retention/alpha/P&L.

### 9.3 Danger areas (one line each, source = that lane's 2026-08-26 handoff)

- **F01**: mixed clocks/session semantics; missing/stale coverage must not read as zero/calm;
  briefing prose overstating causality.
- **F02**: proposal vs enactment vs effective/enforced state; sanctions/license amendments;
  source corrections; location/entity identity; sensitive/paid feed rights.
- **F03**: OI staleness, dealer-sign assumptions, vol-surface timestamp, liquidity, corporate
  actions, multiplier/contract identity, false completeness.
- **F04**: graph proximity/color/decimals look causal; terminal-only scenario magnitude is not
  path shape; no backdating current values into a historical cutoff; high hop frequency can
  coexist with no alpha.
- **F05**: source correction, duplicate econ development across headlines, event-time vs
  known-at, direct vs 2nd-order materiality, causal labels stronger than evidence.
- **F06**: ticker/listing/issuer ambiguity, share classes, stale CIK, partial evidence shown
  complete, privacy leakage, mobile degradation.
- **F07**: consensus vintage/lookahead, unit/period mismatch, share-count/debt/cash identity,
  double-counted assumption changes, saved-object/library divergence, sector model misuse.
- **F08**: mixed live/cost basis, partial price/identity coverage, duplicate holdings,
  benchmark/annualization mismatch, false-zero risk, alert failure masquerading as clear/
  current.
- **F09**: deal amendment/pricing clocks, issuer/security identity, pro-forma capitalization,
  rights/vendor terms, physical-flow latency, chokepoint causal overstatement.
- **F10**: lookahead, non-independent samples, multiple testing, clustered/time-series
  inference, weak instruments, treatment overlap, synthetic-control donor leakage, analog
  outcome leakage/honest N.
- **F11**: thesis duplication, silent edits vs revisions, monitor failure state, source
  correction, permissions, hallucinated chat refs, wrong-metric claim scoring.
- **F12**: cross-tenant leakage, entitlement drift, idempotency ambiguity, replay/webhook
  dedupe, secret exposure, deletion/export incompleteness, schema compatibility, rights.
- **F13**: false-green health after a failed refresh, privacy leakage, vanity usage metrics,
  retrospective claim scoring without a preregistered resolution law, stale methodology docs.

## §10 Open questions the Meta-CEOs must rule on in Wave 0

1. **MO-PAID-020: ListingAlias -> ListingKey renderer + CIK-leg ownership.** Ruled
   OWNER-CORRECTION already at the ledger level (belongs to WS:MARKET-OS/F06, not
   WS:STOCK-IDENTITY), but still `CAPACITY_SELECTABLE / WAITING_CAPACITY` — no session has
   self-assigned it. It gates F06's `MO-PAID-021` (B1B cockpit second issuer) directly, and
   the broader event->security continuation for F05/F06. **Owner: B (F06's lane).** B must
   either self-assign this repair in Wave 0 (per the Chairman override, no capacity-selection
   ceremony is required to block it) or explicitly defer it with a named reason.
2. **F04 X1 K1 exception scope.** The prior ruling permits "typed read-only native
   TXI-episode-transition projections inside the commissioned snapshot" for X1 only,
   explicitly superseding Amendment 3 §5's every-leg K1 clause for this one bounded slice —
   it does not change K1 vocabulary generally or waive checks elsewhere. **Owner: A (F04's
   lane).** Confirm this scope is still what #6872's current head implements before taking it
   to Ready; do not widen it to other F04 legs without a new DEC.
3. **F09 row-accounting repair.** The F09 ledger plan is preserved but needs a repair: "held
   par != issuer debt outstanding" and "theme/name matcher != canonical issuer join" were
   flagged as product-claim errors in the prior F09 planning. **Owner: B (F09's lane).** Fold
   the correction into B's next ledger CSV write; do not ship MO-PAID-060 or any other F09
   row that inherits the uncorrected accounting.
4. **Supabase migration-namespace collision (`0011_*.sql`).** Two open charting-app PRs
   (#502 `0011_thesis_objects.sql`, #507 `0011_analytics_eid.sql`) both claim `0011`; there is
   no `supabase_migrations` schema in Terminal's Supabase project, so files are hand-applied
   and order-independent — the risk is a silent renumbering conflict, not a runtime failure.
   **Owner: B.** Settle in Wave 0 (§5) before either merges.
5. **#6604 and #6809 current state (F03/F04).** The open-PR census's tight regex excluded
   both (likely because #6604's branch name doesn't match the `marketontology|market-os|
   ontology|F0x/F1x` pattern — the census's own methodology note names `options-intelligence-*`
   as excluded from even the broad match). Three F03 ledger rows (`MO-PAID-070`, `MO-PAID-076`,
   `MO-DELTA-033`) are marked `ABSORBED-BY #6604`, and F04's D2C row lives on #6809. **Owner:
   A.** Fresh-read both PRs' real state with `gh pr view`/`gh pr list --search` before disposing
   or building against them (§5).
6. **`WS-MARKET-OS.md` owns_paths.** The census could not confirm this workstream record's
   `owns_paths` field (grep returned no second match under budget) — nine of the thirteen
   lanes cite `WS:MARKET-OS` as their workstream but its exact path ownership is UNKNOWN.
   **Owner: whichever Meta-CEO next needs to cite it precisely** — re-run
   `grep -n -A5 'owns_paths' agentos/workstreams/WS-MARKET-OS.md` before relying on an assumed
   scope.
