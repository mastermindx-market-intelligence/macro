# Macro Release Intelligence (MRI) — Masterplan

Prepared by Fable (main loop), 2026-07-07. Program: `macro-release-intel`.
Status: ratified charter + phased build plan. Display-only program; nothing here
touches a scored surface until the pre-registered forward gates in §7 pass.

## 0. Executive ruling

We build a system that, before each official US data release (CPI first, NFP
second), produces OUR OWN projection of the print with quantile bands and a
confidence read; compares it against an honest benchmark set (naive prior,
trailing trend, Cleveland Fed nowcast, market-implied when available); states
the surprise skew (which side of the benchmark set we sit, in units of
historical surprise dispersion); captures the actual first print when it lands
(ALFRED initial release, not the revised series); scores itself in public on an
append-only forward ledger; and publishes the whole object as display-only
regime context for the Neural Web — the inflation prints feed the inflation
axis of the quad, the labor prints feed the growth axis, and the policy
backdrop join (fed_path market-vs-dots gap, fed_stance, catalyst_tone guidance,
next FOMC) tells the reader what the print means for the Fed's forward path.

What this program is NOT (standing kills honored, §2): not an equity-direction
signal, not an entry conditioner, not an event-risk conviction dampener, not an
LLM-originated forecast.

## 1. Boundary — what already exists (census 2026-07-07)

- `engine/macro_surprise.py` (news W1, #1306): POST-print surprise cards vs
  revised prior / trailing trend / 3-5y z. LEAF, display-only. No projection,
  no consensus, no PIT. MRI extends this lane; does not replace it.
- `engine/event_calendar.py`: CPI/PPI/NFP/GDP/PCE/FOMC/claims/ISM dates from
  the FRED release-dates API with static CY2026 fallback. Reused as-is.
- ALFRED vintage infra (`collectors/fred.py:fetch_vintages`, `engine/pit.py`,
  `data/fred_vintage/vintages.parquet`): initial prints on disk today —
  CPIAUCSL/CPILFESL 1997→ (353 prints), PAYEMS 1997→ (354), PCEPI/PCEPILFE
  2000→, PPIFIS/PPIFES + sticky/median/flex CPI 2014→, ICSA/IC4WSA/CCSA 2009→.
  Backtest is feasible offline from the committed parquet.
- Real-activity nowcast (`engine/conditions.py` labor_nowcast): claims + Indeed
  + Treasury DTS withheld taxes + SF-Fed news sentiment → label only. The
  withheld-tax series is the closest existing NFP-bridge input; no quantitative
  model connects it to the print. MRI builds that model.
- Fed machinery: `engine/fed_path.py` (ZQ/SR3 vs FEDTARMD dots, gap_bp),
  `engine/fed_stance.py` (hawkish/neutral/dovish), `engine/catalyst_tone.py`
  (FOMC statement digests), `data/policy/intel.json` (Warsh/Bessent substrate,
  policy_intent_desk). MRI joins these read-only into `policy_backdrop`.
- NW integration surface: `config/synapse.yml` registry + CI guards
  (synapse_registry, dag_conformance, signal-bus doc regen), display-tier
  authority law (all five authority booleans False), cortex `read_artifact`,
  Mastermind auto-manifest via `external_consumers: [mastermind:context]`.
- In-flight collisions: PR #1635 (R5 macro context rail) is OPEN/CONFLICTING and
  owns `world_state.py` / `mastermind_context.py` / `ask_brain.py` deltas.
  PR #1758 ships a ZORI/Redfin housing HF product (conditioning phase-0 NULL).

## 2. Adjudication against standing kills (MRI-R1..R10)

- **MRI-R1 (scored-surprise kill honored).** DATA_SIGNAL_EXPANSION_2026 item #1
  SKIPPED "macro surprise" as a scored signal: no free PIT consensus, surprises
  absorbed at the print, Citi ESI ≈ −0.04 corr to S&P. MRI does not re-open
  that: it makes NO claim that release surprises predict equity returns. Its
  product is the regime/axis context and the Fed-path read. Any future claim of
  market-direction edge requires a new pre-registered study — not this program.
- **MRI-R2 (entry stack ban).** `esx_macro_release` is NULL 8/8, exhausted.
  Nothing in MRI may condition entries, fire chips, or touch the entry stack.
- **MRI-R3 (no conviction dampener).** Pre-FOMC drift is dead post-2016 and the
  announcement premium is positive. Calendar proximity and projected surprise
  never dampen or scale any score. `impact` stays display tier.
- **MRI-R4 (origination ban).** Projections are deterministic statistical
  models over PIT data. The LLM layer may only narrate calibrated fields and
  de-escalate; it may never originate or adjust a projection, skew, or
  confidence value.
- **MRI-R5 (consensus honesty).** We do not fake street consensus. The
  comparison object is a labeled `benchmark_set`: `naive_prior`,
  `trailing_3m`, `ar_model`, `cleveland_nowcast` (CPI family, forward-accruing
  only), `market_implied` (come-back C-2). Every UI/artifact string says
  "benchmark", never "consensus", until a true consensus source is wired.
- **MRI-R6 (PIT law).** Training/eval on ALFRED initial prints (`pit_vintage`).
  Input legs without vintages are declared `revision_optimistic` per leg in the
  artifact and the prereg. Cleveland nowcast history begins at our first
  collection date — no retroactive benchmark backfill.
- **MRI-R7 (display-only + gates).** Tier `display`, `horizon_role: context`,
  `scored_path_surfaces: []`, all authority booleans False. The word
  "validated" is banned from all MRI user-facing copy until §7 forward gates
  pass (CI-enforced repo-wide).
- **MRI-R8 (ledger law).** `data/release_forecast/forward_ledger.jsonl` is
  advanced only by the nightly lane. Intraday/backtest lanes never write it.
- **MRI-R9 (era law).** All historical accuracy tables era-split at 2010 and
  additionally report the 2021+ inflation-era slice. Monthly prints are
  non-overlapping; weekly claims stats use block-aware errors.
- **MRI-R10 (collision law).** No edits to `engine/neuralweb/world_state.py`,
  `mastermind_context.py`, or `ask_brain.py` while PR #1635 is open. NW
  visibility v1 = synapse registration + `external_consumers:
  [mastermind:context]` + cortex `read_artifact`. The dedicated world_state
  lobe + summarizer is come-back C-1 after #1635 resolves.

## 3. Design

### 3.1 Release set v1

| Release | Target variable | Model class | Institutional anchor |
|---|---|---|---|
| CPI (headline, core) | MoM % (SA) | component nowcast | Cleveland Fed daily CPI nowcast |
| NFP (payrolls) | MoM change, thousands | labor bridge | claims/ADP payroll bridges (SF Fed / street practice) |
| Claims (weekly) | level | short AR + seasonal | — (auto-scored, feeds NFP bridge) |

PCE/PPI/retail sales are v1.1 expansions (come-back C-4) — PCE is largely
derivable from CPI+PPI components and should reuse the CPI machinery.

### 3.2 CPI component nowcast (engine/release_forecast.py)

Legs, each PIT-stamped: energy (weekly retail gasoline GASREGW + WTI pass-through),
core persistence (sticky/median/flex CPI momentum, AR on core MoM),
shelter (CPI shelter momentum; ZORI lead once #1758 lands — read-only reuse),
pipeline (PPI final demand / core momentum), food (PPI food legs where free).
Combine by regularized regression fit walk-forward on ALFRED initial prints;
never refit inside the evaluation fold. Output: point + p10/p25/p50/p75/p90
from empirical residual quantiles of the walk-forward errors.

### 3.3 NFP labor bridge

Legs: initial+continued claims averaged over the survey reference week (the
week containing the 12th), withheld-tax YoY (Treasury DTS, already collected),
ADP private payrolls print (released the Wednesday before NFP; ALFRED vintages
if available, else `revision_optimistic` declared), Indeed postings trend
(display-only leg — copyrighted), AWHMAN momentum. Same walk-forward protocol
and quantile output as CPI.

### 3.4 Confidence and surprise skew

- `confidence ∈ [0,1]`: percentile of current predictive-interval width vs
  history × input-completeness fraction (how many legs have reported for the
  reference period). Both components published separately too.
- `surprise_skew`: (our point − benchmark_set median) / σ of trailing 24
  realized surprises for that release. Sign = direction we lean vs benchmarks;
  magnitude in surprise-sigmas. Plus `skew_tag ∈ {hotter, inline, cooler}` with
  ±0.35σ inline band (frozen in prereg).

### 3.5 Release-day capture + scoreboard

Nightly job (already after US close): if a tracked release printed today, pull
the ALFRED initial print, join the frozen T-1 projection from the forward
ledger, record: actual, our point + interval, each benchmark, realized surprise
vs each, interval coverage hit, skew-direction hit. Scoreboard aggregates per
release type: MAE vs each benchmark, p10–p90 coverage, skew hit-rate with
Wilson CI, n — nulls printed, never hidden.

### 3.6 Artifact contract (`release_forecast.v1`)

```json

  "schema": "release_forecast.v1",

}
```

### 3.7 What the Neural Web does with it (usage spec)

Allowed (display/context): cortex reads it via `read_artifact` and may cite it
in the nightly memo ("CPI prints in 3 sessions; our projection leans hotter
than benchmarks by 0.4σ with policy stance hawkish — inflation-axis risk is
asymmetric"); Mastermind receives the compact manifest row (annotate-only);
the regime page shows which quad axis each upcoming release feeds; the W6
transmission study gives DESCRIPTIVE historical context for what same-sign
surprises did to rates/USD/quad-posterior — a weather report, not a trade.
Future LLM synthesis layers read `policy_backdrop` + projection + scoreboard
as one object (that is the point of the join).

Forbidden: sizing, entry gating, score dampening, board ordering, alert triage,
any Article-2 surface; kernel cells only via the standard quarterly FDR batch
(earliest 2026-10) and only if forward n has accrued.

## 4. Waves and PRs

- **PR-A (W0+W1, this PR)**: masterplan + prereg + data spine — config.yml
  FRED additions (GASREGW, JTSJOL, ADP series id verified at build time,
  UNRATE promoted from on-the-fly to collected), vintage_series additions where
  ALFRED supports them, Cleveland nowcast collector (fail-open, keyless,
  append-only daily snapshots), tests.
- **PR-B (W2)**: `engine/release_forecast.py` (CPI + NFP models, quantiles,
  confidence, skew) + walk-forward backtest harness
  `research/release_forecast/backtest_release_forecast.py` + results report
  (MAE tables vs baselines, era-split, coverage) + contract tests. Opus stats
  review before merge.
- **PR-C (W3)**: `scripts/build_release_forecast.py` nightly producer +
  forward ledger + scoreboard + release-day capture + `daily.yml`/`dag.yml`
  wiring + synapse registrations + SIGNAL_BUS regen + admin lobe description +
  policy_backdrop join. Contract + authority tests.
- **PR-D (W4)**: UI — "Release Radar" section on macro.html (projection vs
  benchmark set vs prior, interval cone, skew chip, countdown, scoreboard +
  track record). Bilingual EN/ZH, no translated `title=`, theme.js law.
- **PR-E (W5)**: pre-registered DESCRIPTIVE transmission study — realized
  surprise (sign×size, PIT) → next-1/5/21-session moves in 10y yield, 2s10s,
  broad dollar, SPY, sector RS, and quad_vector posterior shift; era-split;
  published as `release_playbook.json` display table. No gates, no signal.
  Opus stats review before merge.

Come-backs: **C-1** world_state lobe + macro_weather/mastermind summarizer +
ask_brain routing after #1635 resolves. **C-2** market-implied distribution
adapter (Kalshi/prediction-market read API) as a benchmark_set member. **C-3**
kernel-cell registration at the 2026-10 FDR batch iff forward n ≥ gate. **C-4**
PCE/PPI/retail-sales expansion. **C-5** true consensus feed if a licensed
source ever lands (drop "benchmark" labels only then).

## 5. Data acquisition notes

New FRED series (all keyless-capable): GASREGW (weekly retail gasoline),
JTSJOL (JOLTS openings, context leg), ADP national employment (id verified at
build: ADP* family), UNRATE + RSAFS promoted to collected config (currently
fetched ad-hoc by macro_surprise). Cleveland Fed inflation nowcast: public
endpoint discovered at build time from the indicators page; collector caches
raw payload, appends daily snapshot rows keyed (asof_date, target_month,
series); fail-open with 12h TTL; storage `data/cleveland_nowcast/nowcast.parquet`.
No paid data anywhere in v1 (house W6 paid-data SKIP-ALL honored).

## 6. Falsifiers / kill criteria

- Walk-forward MAE fails to beat `naive_prior` for a release type over the
  full era-split table → that release ships benchmark-only (honest null card:
  "our model adds nothing over naive here"), model leg retired, no iteration
  past 2 pre-registered spec attempts (anti-mining).
- Forward ledger after 12 prints: skew-direction hit-rate Wilson LB < 0.5 AND
  MAE ≥ naive → demote artifact to benchmark-only mode; masterplan updated;
  DO_NOT_REBUILD row appended if the family is closed.
- Interval coverage p10–p90 outside [70%, 95%] after 12 prints → intervals
  recalibrated once (isotonic on walk-forward errors); if still outside after
  12 more, quantile claims dropped from UI.
- Cleveland endpoint breaks ≥30 days → leg marked DARK on the card (foresight
  health pattern), never silently stale.

## 7. Forward gates (pre-registered; graduation, not authority change)

Per release type, evaluated only on the forward ledger (no backtest rows):
n ≥ 12 prints AND MAE < naive_prior MAE AND skew hit-rate Wilson LB > 0.5.
Passing grants a "graduated" badge on the card and permits a proposal (new
adjudication, not automatic) for confirmer-tier registration. Failing prints
the null. Nothing about these gates changes authority booleans — that would be
a separate program with its own gauntlet.

## 8. Ops

Producer runs in the nightly engine lane after collect (release capture needs
same-night FRED/ALFRED refresh; ALFRED vintage fetch requires FRED_API_KEY —
already injected in daily.yml). Compute is trivial (a few monthly series);
render-budget impact ≈ 0. All writes fail-open; a dead collector degrades the
card, never the build.

## 9. Codex "Economic Release Replication Machine" adjudication (2026-07-07 second wave)

Source: research/ECONOMIC_RELEASE_REPLICATION_MACHINE.md (Codex, doc-only
handoff). Verdict: the doc is the institutional-architecture layer this
program was pointed at; roughly 40% was already built by waves A-E on the
same day, and the deltas below are adopted into THIS program. Rulings:

- **MRI-R11 (no parallel system).** Codex's "Macro Release Lab" as a separate
  structure (engine/release_lab/, data/release_lab/) is REJECTED — same-lane
  duplication. Every adopted capability lands inside macro-release-intel's
  existing paths (engine/release_forecast*, data/release_forecast/,
  site/macrodata/release_forecast.json). The Codex doc is a design source,
  not a second program.
- **MRI-R12 (Cleveland history basis).** The Cleveland nowcast daily paths
  backfilled from the public endpoint carry obs_date as published; they may
  be used in DESCRIPTIVE comparison tables labeled "as re-served by the
  Cleveland endpoint". PIT-graded statistics keep the first_seen_asof rule
  from MRI-R6 unchanged.
- **MRI-R13 (gates).** Codex's consensus-relative gates are re-pointed at the
  benchmark set (no consensus feed exists — MRI-R5 stands). The §7 forward
  gates are pre-registered and UNCHANGED. Adopted as supplementary REPORTED
  (non-binding) diagnostics: interval_60 coverage vs [50%,75%], grade vs
  first release AND vs latest revision separately, and market-reaction
  usefulness. Codex's maturity horizons (18-24 CPI / 24-36 NFP prints)
  are adopted as display copy ("earned-trust horizon"), not as gates.
- **MRI-R14 (committee discipline).** Model-committee ensembling with learned
  weights is DEFERRED until forward-ledger maturity; until then one frozen
  spec per target (§6 anti-mining). Codex's own "weights must not be
  optimized until enough frozen observations" is made binding.
- **MRI-R15 (surprise distribution).** p_hot/p_cold/p_inline computed
  deterministically from our walk-forward residual distribution relative to
  the benchmark median (±0.35σ inline band from §3.4). No new authority; a
  restatement of existing quantiles.
- **MRI-R16 (market-implied prior).** collectors/prediction_markets.py
  (exists; Polymarket Gamma, keyless, append-only snapshots) fills
  benchmark_set.market_implied where a matching CPI/jobs event trades.
  Market-expectation CONTEXT only: never fused into the model point
  (prior-blending REJECTED — a model that ingests the market prior cannot
  detect a stale market prior), never a gate.
- **MRI-R17 (reaction layer).** A per-release "expected market sensitivity"
  chip is adopted as a DESCRIPTIVE join of release_playbook cells with the
  current regime label. The conditional reaction-function regression is
  deferred until playbook n grows; positioning inputs are FORBIDDEN
  (Signal Commons: positioning fusion illegal).
- **MRI-R18 (paid data).** PriceStats/Manheim-paid/LinkUp/Revelio/ADP-paid
  all SKIP (house W6 paid-data SKIP-ALL). Public Manheim mid-month value is
  a possible future keyless collector pending a licensing read.
- **Spec-attempt ledger.** Adding the shelter stock-adjustment leg (Codex
  §5.2, fed by the merged #1758 ZORI product) is pre-registered as spec
  attempt #2 of 2 for BOTH cpi_core and cpi_headline (§6 anti-mining).
  If attempt #2 fails its target's kill rule, that target goes
  benchmark-only; there is no v3 without a program-level adjudication.

Adopted build waves: **PR-F** ledger schema v2 (release_id/prediction_id/
inputs_hash/horizon_hours; dual grading first-vs-latest; EOD h0/h1 market-
reaction fields on scored rows; weekly claims target for ledger velocity;
engine module split for parallel component work). **PR-G** CPI component
upgrade (shelter stock-adjustment leg with lease-reset smoothing and
shrink-to-BLS-momentum divergence guard; per-component contrib_pp; known/
proxy/residual weight-share decomposition driving confidence v2; backtest
v2 re-run with full legs). **PR-H** NFP decomposition (private/government
split, AHE + hours as v2 targets, birth-death prior table from published
BLS CES tables, JOLTS leg, revisions-risk field). **PR-I** market-implied
benchmark + surprise_distribution + sensitivity chip. **PR-K** UI v2
(component breakdown, known/residual bar, market-implied row, sensitivity).

### 9.1 Second-wave reconciliation (2026-07-07, Fable main loop)

The same external doc was independently adjudicated twice on 2026-07-07 (this
file §9 via #1877, and a parallel Fable lane whose branch predated #1877 —
closed PR #1879). The verdicts CONVERGED on every major call: no parallel
system, benchmark honesty, committee/ensemble deferral to ledger maturity,
component attribution + market-implied benchmark as adopted deltas. This
section reconciles the second lane's remainder into canonical numbering.

- **MRI-R19 (attribution law).** Component contributions (PR-G) are the
  linear model's own exact decomposition (coef × z-value, in pp), published
  as-is with the residual share printed. They may never be manually adjusted,
  re-weighted for narrative, or hidden when unflattering.
- **MRI-R20 (quirk law).** Release-quirk flags are deterministic calendar
  facts with citations (CPI annual weight-update/seasonal-revision print; CPI
  health-insurance reset window; NFP CES benchmark + population-control
  print; claims holiday weeks; 4-vs-5-week survey gaps). They annotate
  uncertainty on the card; they never shift the point, intervals, or skew.
  Strike/weather flags require a free feed (come-back C-7). Build wave:
  PR-G/PR-K.
- **§6 application — claims (evidence attached).** The second lane ran the
  weekly-claims walk-forward offline from committed ICSA vintages
  (research/release_forecast/CLAIMS_BACKTEST.md). Its ridge spec (attempt 1)
  FAILED naive_prior (MAE 40.8k vs 28.7k full window; 24.0 vs 14.8 2021+).
  The #1877 frozen IC4WSA spec (attempt 2) was evaluated under the same
  protocol: MAE 43.9k vs naive 27.9k (full window); 17.7k vs 14.8k (2021+) —
  FAILED on both arms. Per §6, claims mode = benchmark_only, enforced in the
  producer. Benchmarks (naive_prior, trailing_4w, ar_model) are graded on the
  forward ledger either way — 52 prints/yr of ledger velocity is the point,
  not the model point. There is no attempt 3 without a program-level adjudication.
- **Market-implied sources.** MRI-R16 stands; #1876 adds a Kalshi
  release-ladder collector (KXCPI / KXPAYROLLS / KXJOBLESSCLAIMS, first-seen
  snapshots, implied_median only — implied_mean REJECTED as
  tail-assumption-dishonest on an open-ended ladder). PR-I joins whichever
  source has a matching market; context only, never fused (MRI-R16).
- **Naming.** The second lane's "Package F/F1..F4" labels are retired in
  favor of this file's PR-F..PR-K wave names; its Kalshi collector is PR-I
  groundwork.
- **MRI-R20 port (quirk flags).** Five deterministic calendar quirk flags (engine/release_quirks.py) were ported verbatim from closed PR #1884 (already adversarially reviewed) onto the Package I/K structure in this PR; the double-build collision that produced #1884 was resolved in favor of #1883's enrichment idiom, so quirk_flags now attach in _enrich_upcoming_block alongside surprise_distribution / market_implied / reaction_sensitivity, with quirk_flag_codes frozen on the projection ledger row and bilingual warning chips rendered on the Release Radar card.

## 10. Third wave — v3 challenger track, new targets, expectation reads, UI simplification (2026-07-08, operator-directed program-level adjudication)

Trigger: operator directive to strengthen Release Radar modeling ("extensive
multifactoral analysis"), extend rigor to all economic releases, make the
over/under-expectation read first-class, and simplify the UI. §9's spec-attempt
ledger froze CPI targets at 2/2 attempts with "no v3 without a program-level
adjudication" — this section IS that adjudication. Discipline is unchanged:
one frozen spec per new track, champion keeps the card, forward ledger judges.

- **MRI-R21 (v3 challenger charter).** One multifactor CHALLENGER per release
  family, model class frozen before backtest: a walk-forward ragged-edge
  factor model — z-scored mixed feature panel (energy, inflation-expectation
  breakevens [EXPINF* excluded: whole-history re-reviser], pipeline PPI,
  core persistence, shelter, labor/demand, dollar blocks), complete-case,
  PCA top-3 factors (pure numpy SVD), ridge (lambda=1.0) on [factors +
  naive anchor]. The CHAMPION (frozen v2) keeps the card and the ledger's
  primary rows. The challenger: backtest first (same era tables, same
  naive-kill rule — if it can't beat naive it is not even shadowed), then
  SHADOW projection rows on the forward ledger (model tag 'v3_factor',
  frozen nightly like the champion, scored identically). Promotion to the
  card requires a NEW program-level adjudication citing forward evidence
  (guideline: n≥6 scored prints AND challenger MAE ≤ champion MAE), never a
  backtest alone. No weight/feature iteration post-results. The Codex §4.4
  committee/ensemble stays DEFERRED per MRI-R14 (frozen-weight blending is
  revisited only at ledger maturity).
- **MRI-R22 (expectation-read semantics).** Two DISTINCT reads, both
  deterministic, published on every card:
  (a) trend-surprise lean (existing skew tag + surprise_distribution) —
      our point vs the TREND benchmark median (naive/trailing/AR) in
      walk-forward-σ units; copy: hotter/inline/cooler.
  (b) expectation read (NEW) — our point vs the EXPECTATION SET median =
      {cleveland_nowcast (CPI family), kalshi implied_median (any target,
      when a ladder trades)}: overexpectation / underexpectation / aligned
      with the same ±0.35·σ_scale band; copy: "above expectations 高于预期 /
      below expectations 低于预期 / aligned 符合预期". Empty expectation set →
      read is null and the card falls back to (a) only, labeled. The word
      consensus (共识) stays banned; 预期 refers to the published nowcast/
      market set, with sources listed in the modal.
- **MRI-R23 (new-target charter).** PCE headline MoM, PCE core MoM, PPI
  final-demand MoM, retail sales MoM enter as v1-class targets, attempt #1
  of 2 each, own frozen ridge specs (PCE rides CPI-family features + own
  lags; PPI: own lags + energy block; retail: own lags + gasoline +
  claims momentum). Vintages: PCEPI/PCEPILFE 2000→ and PPIFIS 2014→ exist
  on disk; RSAFS accrues from the 2026-07-08 nightly (machinery ships with
  honest no_data until then, AHE pattern). Same kill rules, era tables,
  ledger/scoreboard flow, release dates from engine/event_calendar (PCE
  id=54, PPI id=46 already wired there).
- **MRI-R24 (UI simplification law).** Release Radar becomes SIMPLE CARDS +
  on-click DETAIL MODAL. Card shows ONLY: release name + countdown, OUR
  projection (headline number), the two chips from MRI-R22 (expectation
  read + trend lean), and confidence. Everything else (interval cone,
  benchmark strip, components, composition bar, surprise gauge, reaction
  sensitivity, quirk chips [#1887], revision risk, policy backdrop, track
  record) moves into the modal, organized in that order. A bug-fix pass is
  part of the wave; per the wave-2 lesson, render tests must include
  live-path integration tests against a realistic full artifact fixture,
  not synthetic-only units. Display-only footnote stays on both card and
  modal.

Waves: **PR-L** (this PR) §10 + expectation_read fields + tests. **PR-M**
v3 challenger (prereg → backtest → shadow wiring, adversarial review).
**PR-N** new targets (prereg → backtest → producer/UI plumbing, adversarial
review). **PR-O** UI card+modal + bug fixes. Come-back C-8: committee blend
at ledger maturity. C-9: challenger promotion adjudication at n≥6 forward
prints.

## 11. Wave 10 — v3 build-out program (operator-directed, 2026-07-08, Fable main loop)

Trigger: operator directive to execute the §10 charter as a full build AND to
add a BLS relative-importance CPI **component bridge** (beyond §10's factor-model
challenger). This section is the program-kickoff adjudication and FREEZES the
per-track specs before any backtest runs (§6 anti-mining). External handoff
`research/RELEASE_RADAR_CPI_NFP_INSTITUTIONAL_UPGRADE.md` (Codex) is adopted as a
DESIGN SOURCE only: ~80% was already chartered in §9/§10; the net-new deltas
(component bridge, input-snapshot receipts, source-coverage flags) are ruled
below. All standing law is unchanged: display-only, benchmark-only (MRI-R5, the
word "consensus"/共识 stays banned), one frozen spec per track, forward ledger is
the sole judge (§7 gates unchanged), zero authority booleans, no LLM origination
(MRI-R4). Nothing here graduates a surface; graduation is still §7.

- **MRI-R25 (component-bridge challenger charter).** A BLS relative-importance
  CPI component bridge enters as a SECOND CHALLENGER track (parallel to R21's
  factor model), model class frozen here. Blocks and per-block MoM method
  (frozen): (1) energy — gasoline from GASREGW reference-month average
  (unrevised, already implemented) + electricity from APU000072610 MoM; (2)
  shelter — OER + rent via the existing shelter_nowcast (ZORI + CUSR0000SAH1,
  PREREG_V2 frozen); (3) food-at-home — directional from PPI food inputs
  (WPU01/WPU012 if free) applied to CUSR0000SAF11 prior; (4) core-goods pipeline
  — PPIFIS/PPIFES momentum (already the pipeline leg); (5) core-services
  ex-shelter — CUSR0000SASLE persistence lags. ALL OTHER blocks (used vehicles,
  new vehicles, airfares, lodging, medical services, health insurance, food-away)
  are PRIOR-ONLY at confidence 0.0 — no free PIT proxy exists (Manheim/STR/scanner
  are paid → house W6 SKIP); modelling them would be false precision. Bridge math:
  contribution_pp[block] = mom_est[block] × relative_importance_weight[block];
  headline_est = Σ contributions + residual; residual = printed, never hidden
  (MRI-R19). Weights: BLS annual relative-importance flat file
  (bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/2025.htm = Dec-2025 basis, in effect
  Jan–Dec 2026), keyless collector with FREDGRAPH_UA WAF workaround, materialised
  as a manually-versioned YAML (`data/release_forecast/component_weights/`),
  PIT-refreshed once each January (weights are frozen for the calendar year).
  Component sub-index series are NOT yet ALFRED-vintaged → declared
  `revision_optimistic` per leg until added to vintage_series and depth-audited.
  Discipline: backtest as a CHALLENGER vs champion ridge AND naive (same era
  tables, same kill rule); if it cannot beat naive it is NOT shadowed (honest
  null card). If it beats naive → SHADOW projection rows tagged `cpi_bridge`,
  frozen nightly, scored identically; the champion (frozen v2 ridge) keeps the
  card. Promotion to card requires a new adjudication citing forward evidence
  (C-9-class). No weight/feature/block iteration post-results.

- **MRI-R26 (provenance & source-coverage law).** Every projection freezes an
  input-snapshot RECEIPT: the feature→value manifest known at the cutoff, each
  leg's first-seen/vintage/stale status, and the existing `inputs_hash`
  (sha256). Written to `data/release_forecast/input_snapshots/<prediction_id>.json`
  and referenced (not inlined) on the ledger row. Four display-only coverage
  flags attach to each upcoming item and freeze on the ledger row:
  `weight_coverage` (share of the release's economic basis backed by a modelled
  leg — for CPI, the RI weight covered by non-prior blocks), `fresh_proxy_coverage`
  (share weighted by a leg that has fresh current reference-month data),
  `non_vintaged_share` (share of legs lacking ALFRED first-seen), and
  `model_maturity` (count of forward-SCORED prints for that target, read from the
  ledger — 0 today). These NEVER gate, score, size, or alter a point/interval/skew
  (authority test enforced); they drive an honest UI "fresh / partial / stale /
  prior-heavy" chip and an abstention hint. The chart-of-record is the champion;
  coverage flags are metadata about it.

- **MRI-R27 (Codex audit scope rulings).** ADOPTED as net-new: the component
  bridge (R25), input-snapshot receipts + coverage flags (R26). ADOPTED as a
  latent-bug fix: the ADP series reconciliation — the collector writes
  `ADPMNUSNERSA` but `engine/release_components_nfp.py` reads a nonexistent
  `ADPNFRPRIVSA.parquet`, so `adp_change` is silently always-absent; the fix
  points the engine at the collected series (or documents the alias) and emits a
  coverage diagnostic — no model re-tuning, display-only, `adp` stays
  revision_optimistic. RE-POINTED to the benchmark set (no consensus feed):
  Codex's consensus/hot-cold "skill" and Brier/ECE track record stay DEFERRED
  until a licensed feed AND §7 forward-n exist (MRI-R5). DEFERRED: model committee
  / ensemble (C-8, MRI-R14 stands). REJECTED: `engine/release_lab` /
  `data/release_lab` parallel structures (MRI-R11 stands — everything lands under
  the existing `release_forecast` family); LLM origination (MRI-R4); any
  entry/sizing/scoring/authority coupling (MRI-R2/R3/R7). Claims stays
  benchmark-only (§9.1, no attempt 3).

### 11.1 Frozen track specs (committed here before any backtest)

Common protocol for every modelled track (unchanged from §3.2/PREREG_V2):
ridge λ=1.0 (no tuning), z-scored features, complete-case per prediction row,
expanding-window walk-forward, MIN_TRAIN_OBS=60, empirical residual quantiles
(MIN_QUANTILE_OBS=24), COVID months (2020-03..2020-06) excluded from era stats,
targets are ALFRED first prints (`pit_vintage`), non-vintaged legs declared per
leg. Kill rule (frozen): model MAE ≥ naive_prior MAE in BOTH the full window AND
the 2021+ slice → that track/target ships benchmark_only; max 2 spec attempts.
No sklearn/statsmodels/scipy.stats — pure numpy.

- **Track M (v3 factor challenger; MRI-R21).** Targets cpi_headline, cpi_core,
  nfp. Feature panel per target (z-scored, complete-case): CPI family = {own MoM
  lags 1–3, sticky/median/flex CPI momentum, PPIFIS & PPIFES momentum,
  gasoline_mom (headline only), shelter_nowcast, DTWEXBGS dollar momentum};
  NFP family = {own change lags 1–3, survey-week ICSA & CCSA, withheld_tax_yoy,
  awhman_mom, adp_change (post-R27 fix), DTWEXBGS momentum}. EXPINF* breakevens
  EXCLUDED (whole-history re-reviser, R21). Model: complete-case → PCA top-3
  factors via pure-numpy SVD → ridge(λ=1.0) on [3 factors + naive anchor (own
  lag-1)]. Output: point + p10/p25/p50/p75/p90 identical schema. Ledger tag
  `v3_factor`. Not shadowed unless it beats naive.

- **Track N (new targets; MRI-R23).** Frozen ridge specs, attempt #1 of 2 each:
  - `pce_headline` (PCEPI MoM SA, vintage 2000→): own MoM lags 1–3 +
    sticky/median/flex momentum + PPIFIS momentum + gasoline_mom.
  - `pce_core` (PCEPILFE MoM SA, vintage 2000→): own lags 1–3 +
    sticky/median/flex momentum + PPIFES momentum.
  - `ppi_finaldemand` (PPIFIS MoM SA, vintage 2014→, THIN — shallow-history
    caveat printed): own lags 1–3 + gasoline_mom + PPIFES momentum lag.
  - `retail_sales` (RSAFS MoM SA): SCAFFOLD-ONLY honest `no_data` — RSAFS parquet
    is not on disk and retail dates are not in event_calendar yet; machinery
    ships benchmark_only/no_data (AHE pattern) and the attempt clock does not
    start until the series + release calendar accrue. Release dates for
    pce/ppi from event_calendar (PCE id=54, PPI id=46, already wired).

- **Track CB (component bridge; MRI-R25).** As frozen in R25 above. Prereg file
  `PREREG_CPI_BRIDGE_V1.md`; component map `cpi_component_map.yml`.

- **Track PROV (MRI-R26) & Track O (UI; MRI-R24).** As frozen in R26 / §10 R24.

### 11.2 Execution plan (collision-aware)

The producer (`scripts/build_release_forecast.py`) and the engine dispatch
(`engine/release_forecast.py:project_release`) are the hot shared files. Order:

- **Round 1 — parallel science (new files only, no shared-file edits, mergeable
  independently):** Track M science (prereg + `engine/release_forecast_v3.py` +
  backtest + results), Track N science (prereg + standalone specs + backtests +
  results), Track CB science (map + `collectors/bls_cpi_weights.py` +
  `engine/release_cpi_bridge.py` + prereg + backtest + results), Track PROV
  (`engine/release_provenance.py` + ADP fix + its producer wiring). Kill-rule
  gate adjudicated (Fable) between rounds — a track that fails naive is wired
  benchmark_only, never shadowed.
- **Round 2 — serial integration (single actor, the hot files):** wire challenger
  shadow rows + new targets (dispatch + `_TRACKED_RELEASES` + `_find_upcoming`) +
  component-bridge display + coverage flags into the producer; contract +
  authority + PIT tests.
- **Round 3 — UI (PR-O):** simple card + detail modal (R24), live-path
  integration render test vs a realistic full-artifact fixture, bug-fix pass.

Every science/integration wave gets an Opus stats/red-team review before merge;
Sonnet builds, Opus reviews, Fable adjudicates & merges. Forward gates (§7) and
come-backs (C-8 committee, C-9 challenger promotion) are unchanged.

### 11.3 Wave-10 close-out — shipped 2026-07-08 (8 PRs)

Charter #1960 · foundation #1962 · Track M #1967 · Track N #1966 · Track CB
#1969 · integration-2a #1970 · integration-2b #1971 · UI #1972. All display-only,
benchmark-only, zero authority; §7 forward gates unchanged. Outcomes of record:

- **Foundation (#1962).** Materialized keyless GASREGW / CUSR0000SAF11 / WPU01 /
  WPU012 / ADPMNUSNERSA — **gasoline was silently absent from the champion CPI
  model** (dead file path). ADP latent-bug fixed (was reading a nonexistent
  `ADPNFRPRIVSA.parquet`): now the SA `ADPMNUSNERSA`, contemporaneous
  `level[M]−level[M-1]` in thousands, declared `revision_optimistic` — but held
  **OUT of the champion** `feature_names` (champion kept byte-frozen, RESULTS_V2
  intact) and reserved for the Track-M challenger. `engine/release_provenance.py`
  = input-snapshot receipts + coverage flags.
- **Track M — v3_factor challenger (#1967).** Per-step PCA-top-3 (numpy SVD) →
  ridge on [factors + naive anchor]. cpi_headline / cpi_core / nfp all clear the
  naive kill rule (shadow-eligible) but **all trail the champion**; nfp is
  sub-naive on the full window with a catastrophic 2020-recovery error →
  annotated "do not read as an improvement". Shadowed on the ledger; champion
  keeps the card; promotion gated at C-9 (n≥6 forward).
- **Track N — new targets (#1966).** pce_headline / pce_core / ppi_finaldemand
  all **MODEL** (beat naive, both windows), PIT-clean after sticky/median/flex
  were moved to ALFRED first-print (a review-caught leak). retail_sales ships as
  an honest **`no_data` scaffold** (RSAFS parquet + retail calendar not yet on
  disk); attempt-1 clock starts only when they accrue. ppi carries a thin-history
  caveat (vintages from 2014).
- **Track CB — BLS component bridge (#1969, MRI-R25).** Relative-importance
  weighted bridge (5 nowcastable blocks ≈ 60-65% of basket; the rest prior-only
  at conf 0.0). After an Opus-caught partition correction (core_goods
  double-count + food-in-core + true 100-weight partition + a real reconciliation
  residual replacing a tautological zero), **cpi_headline bridge beats naive and
  edges the champion (0.154 vs 0.159 full)** → shadow-eligible; **cpi_core stayed
  NULL** even after the fix → family closed (2-attempt cap). The correction did
  not rescue the verdict that mattered — evidence it was a bug fix, not mining.
  Weights keyless (BLS flat file, FREDGRAPH_UA), PIT-refreshed each January.
- **Provenance / coverage (2a #1970).** Per-prediction input-snapshot receipts;
  four honest coverage flags (weight_coverage / fresh_proxy_coverage /
  non_vintaged_share / model_maturity). A review-and-probe-caught denominator bug
  (projections never enumerated their vintaged legs → non_vintaged_share=1.0 for
  mostly-vintaged models) was fixed at the source: every projection now emits
  `vintaged_legs` + `input_manifest`.
- **Shadow tracks (2b #1971).** v3_factor + cpi_bridge frozen nightly on the
  forward ledger (row_type `shadow_projection`, 5-tuple idempotency key incl.
  `model`), attached to the artifact for the modal, scored per (release, model)
  vs the same first-print. Champion rows untouched.
- **UI (Round 3 #1972, MRI-R24).** Simple card (name+countdown, our projection,
  expectation-read + trend-lean chips, confidence) + on-click detail modal
  (interval, benchmarks, champion 4-block attribution DISTINCT from the bridge
  7-block waterfall, coverage chip, confidence composition, surprise/reaction/
  quirk, revision risk, v3_factor + cpi_bridge shadows, policy backdrop, track
  record). Bilingual, theme.js, live-path integration render test. Browser-QA'd.

**Live shadow clocks (C-9 challenger-promotion candidates, n≥6 forward scored):**
v3_factor (cpi_headline / cpi_core / nfp) and cpi_bridge (cpi_headline). Champion
keeps every card until a promotion adjudication cites forward evidence. C-8
committee still deferred (MRI-R14). PCE/PPI attempt-2 only via adjudication;
retail attempt-1 pending data accrual.

## 12. Wave 11 — robustness, revision intelligence, honest-benchmark restatement, UI rebuild (operator-directed, 2026-07-10, Fable main loop)

Trigger: operator directive for a Fable audit + substantial upgrade (better
projections, revision anticipation, surprise edge-case intelligence, UI fix).
Basis: an 8-lane audit/research fan-out (3 Opus audits: engine-stats, ops-
robustness, UI; 5 research lanes: institutional CPI methods, NFP revision
mechanics, surprise anatomy 1998–2026, free-data census, vintage empirics on
our own ALFRED store). This section is the program adjudication and FREEZES
new-track specs before any backtest (§6). All standing law unchanged
(display-only, benchmark honesty MRI-R5, no LLM origination MRI-R4, forward
gates §7, claims benchmark-only).

### 12.1 Verdict-integrity rulings (apply before any new modeling)

- **MRI-R28 (strongest-naive law).** The last-MoM `naive_prior` is a strawman
  benchmark for SA MoM targets (audit F1: pce_core's walk-forward MAE 0.2682
  vs expanding-mean 0.2677 — the "MODEL" verdict tied a constant; cpi_headline
  champion 0.2260 vs expanding-mean 0.2306). Rulings: (a) Wave-10 verdicts
  STAND as frozen — they were honest under the pre-registered rule; moving the
  goalposts post-results is reverse-mining. (b) The benchmark set gains
  `expanding_mean`; scoreboard and all RESULTS files gain REPORTED (non-
  binding, MRI-R13 pattern) columns vs strongest-of {naive_prior,
  expanding_mean, trailing_3m}. (c) All §12 tracks onward use the STRONGEST
  naive as their kill benchmark. (d) pce_core (and any target whose margin
  over the strongest naive is ≈0) carries an honesty caveat in card copy.
- **MRI-R29 (bridge claim voided; scope defect deferred).** The cpi_bridge
  backtest reads latest-revised sub-index parquets (audit F2) — its "edges
  champion" margin is revision-optimistic and is VOIDED as a promotion
  argument; forward-ledger evidence is the only promotion basis (restating
  existing law). The SASLE scope overlap (F3: core-goods dynamics enter via
  both SASLE and the PPI pipeline block) is a real construction defect, but a
  proxy-scope change = spec attempt #2, pointless until the sub-index series
  are ALFRED-vintaged. Ruling: bridge stays frozen as-built; comeback C-10 =
  vintage the sub-index series (add to vintage_series), then decide whether to
  spend attempt #2 on a PIT-clean scope-fixed re-run.
- **MRI-R30 (sanctioned interval recalibration).** Coverage falsifier is
  TRIPPED (§6 [70%,95%] gate): cpi_core p10–p90 64.1% and pce_core 67.7% in
  2021+ (bands regime-blind, F4). Execute the ONE §6-sanctioned recalibration
  as **vol-scaled residual quantiles**: residuals standardized by a trailing
  realized-error σ_t (rolling window, expanding-min guard), quantiles taken on
  standardized residuals, re-scaled by current σ_t. ONE spec, applied
  UNIFORMLY to every target (no per-target tuning), points untouched,
  coverage re-reported per era. If coverage is still outside the gate after 12
  more forward prints, quantile claims drop from the UI (existing §6 rule).
- **MRI-R31 (scoring upgrades, reported-only).** Scoreboard gains pinball
  loss (5-quantile sum) per target and model. The §7 skew arm is under-powered
  at n=12 (Wilson LB for 9/12 ≈ 0.49); it is downgraded to DESCRIPTIVE display
  until n ≥ 24 — the §7 MAE arm is unchanged. RESULTS_CPI_BRIDGE_V1.md is
  regenerated so shipped numbers match shipped code (F7).

### 12.2 Ops-robustness rulings (audit blockers/majors; W11-A)

- **MRI-R32 (no-orphan law).** (a) Catch-up scoring sweep: every nightly,
  score ANY unscored past-release projection (champion + shadows) whose
  initial print exists in vintages — bounded lookback 120d, idempotent.
  (b) The T-1 candidate filter becomes `asof_night <= release_date` preferring
  the latest strictly-pre-release row; release-day-frozen rows are stamped
  `frozen_on_release_day` and annotated on the scoreboard, never dropped.
  (c) First nightly after an outage re-emits a projection for a just-passed
  unprojected release only when no pre-release row exists, flagged `late`.
  (d) ALFRED vintages for tracked release series refresh NIGHTLY (the 7-day
  mtime gate caused the store to trail by ~2 weeks; claims 2026-07-09 print
  was unscorable). (e) Missing/failed FRED_API_KEY or stale vintage store with
  past-due unscored projections surfaces as a loud `capture_health` block on
  latest.json (reasons: missing_vintage / no_t1_projection / api_key_absent),
  rendered as a small health strip — silence is never success (HEALTH-CARD-1).
- **MRI-R33 (ledger hygiene).** Revision rows get revision-value-aware append
  keys (REV-DEDUP-1); ledger appends fsync (DURABILITY-1); enrichers carry
  per-source TTL staleness gates and stale reasons (Kalshi/market-implied ≤5d,
  GASREGW/ZORI/Cleveland recency checks) — a stale source nulls the field with
  a reason, never silently extrapolates (STALE-ENRICH-1/2). input_snapshots:
  keep the frozen T-1 receipt per (release, period) permanently; GC all other
  snapshots older than 30d; nightly job enforces (SNAPSHOT-GC-1).
- **MRI-R34 (Cleveland join fix).** data/cleveland_nowcast/ is live (rows
  through today) yet benchmark_set.cleveland_nowcast is null — the
  `_read_cleveland_nowcast` join is broken (period/series mapping). Fix with a
  regression test against the real parquet; the declared institutional anchor
  must actually populate. PIT law MRI-R6/R12 unchanged (first_seen basis).
- **MRI-R35 (cutoff labels).** Projection rows gain `cutoff_label`: the
  frozen pre-release row = `T-1`; the second-upcoming period row (frozen
  nightly mid-flight) = `early`. Both are scored per cutoff on the ledger and
  scoreboard (separate columns, forward-only). This creates the measured
  substrate for early-read accuracy — where Track T's value claim lives.

### 12.3 New chartered tracks (frozen specs; kill = MAE ≥ strongest-naive in BOTH full and 2021+ windows unless stated; pure numpy; PIT per MRI-R6)

- **Track T (MRI-R36) — mixed-frequency energy-accumulator headline nowcast
  (Cleveland-style), cpi_headline ONLY, attempt #1 of 1.** Motivation: the
  champion is lag-based; institutional headline edges come from within-month
  energy accumulation (research REC-1/REC-12; DCOILWTICO daily is collected +
  effectively unrevised). Frozen spec: (leg 1: energy) reference-month retail
  gasoline nowcast = mean of published GASREGW weeks in month M + remaining-
  weeks projection via daily-WTI pass-through (beta from expanding-window OLS
  of weekly GASREGW changes on trailing daily WTI changes, no look-ahead);
  energy contribution = gasoline MoM × RI motor-fuel weight × expanding-OLS
  pass-through to headline. (leg 2: ex-energy) AR(3) + sin/cos month terms on
  the derived ex-energy MoM series (vintaged headline first-print MoM minus
  computed energy contribution — self-consistent, PIT). Aggregation:
  ridge(λ=1.0) walk-forward of headline MoM on [energy_contrib, exenergy_ar,
  sin, cos]; MIN_TRAIN_OBS=60; standard quantiles (vol-scaled after MRI-R30).
  Scored at BOTH cutoffs (T-1 and early, MRI-R35). Kill rule at T-1 vs
  strongest naive; its VALUE claim (early-cutoff accuracy vs champion-at-
  early) is evaluated on the forward ledger only. Shadow tag `mf_energy`.
- **Track R (MRI-R37) — NFP first→third revision-direction model, attempt #1
  of 2.** Empirical basis from OUR vintage store: fp-surprise↔revision corr
  −0.60 (−0.73 recent non-covid), walk-forward sign hit 63.8% vs 54.3%
  majority baseline, Wilson LB 55.1%, n=127 (research REC-1). Frozen target:
  sign(payems_mom_change[T, vintage=release(T+2)] − payems_mom_change[T,
  vintage=release(T)]) — the first→third revision to the MoM change, from a
  NEW multi-vintage PAYEMS store (ALFRED output_type=2, additive collector;
  the existing output_type=4 first-print pipeline is untouched). Frozen
  features (pre-declared; the prior-revision feature EXCLUDED for leakage):
  fp_surprise_vs_AR1, sin/cos month, ICSA 4m survey-week change (first-print
  vintages). Estimator: ridge(λ=1.0) on z-scored features → sign;
  MIN_TRAIN_OBS=60; COVID months excluded from era stats. Kill rule (sign
  target): walk-forward hit-rate Wilson LB must exceed the majority-class
  base rate in the full non-covid window; else no display. Output: a
  DISPLAY-ONLY `revision_lean` field on the NFP card {up/down/none, strength,
  n, hit-rate to date}, frozen on the ledger and scored forward when the
  third print lands. NEVER touches point/interval/skew. Additionally
  (descriptive, no model): the procyclical LEVEL-bias annotation (expansions
  +216k mean cumulative level revision, contractions −262k; MoM-change bias
  is NOT significant and must not be implied — research REC-5), and the
  revision-risk composite gains collection-rate / birth-death-anomaly /
  benchmark-cycle context fields as free collectors land (NFP-R5, comeback
  C-11 for the Philly-Fed early-benchmark feed).
- **Track S (MRI-R38) — surprise-anatomy flag engine + print-integrity chip
  (display-only, MRI-R20 law: flags annotate uncertainty, never shift
  values).** From the 33-episode catalog (research lane; catalog ships as
  research/release_forecast/SURPRISE_ANATOMY_1998_2026.md): (a) new
  deterministic quirk flags in engine/release_quirks.py — active-strike flag
  (BLS work-stoppages monthly listing, free HTML, new keyless collector);
  NFP preliminary-benchmark flag (September preliminary magnitude >±100k →
  flag the following January print); government-shutdown/appropriations-gap
  flag (deterministic calendar); census-hiring flag (decennial calendar,
  currently inactive). (b) probabilistic display annotations — hurricane-
  landfall flag (NOAA NHC public track data, ≤30d before NFP reference week);
  birth-death-anomaly note. (c) **print-integrity chip**: CES collection/
  response rates + CPI median standard errors + revision-streak length
  (free BLS tables, new collector) → a data-quality regime read {normal /
  degraded / disrupted} on each card. This is the honest, factual frame for
  "releases differing from expectations": collection quality is measurable
  and has degraded since 2019; we display it, we never speculate. (d) The
  episode catalog is joined to the History surface (modal) as a static
  reference table. CPI revision-direction modeling is KILLED before attempt
  (annual seasonal-recalc revisions are tiny; empirics REC-3) — recorded in
  DO_NOT_REBUILD.
- **Data adoptions (W11 scope):** TRMMEANCPIM158SFRBCLE (Cleveland 16%
  trimmed-mean CPI) + JTSQUR (quits) collected as context series (no champion
  spec change — future chartered attempts may draw on them); work-stoppages,
  CES response rates, CPI SE tables per Track S. DEFERRED to comebacks: NY Fed
  SCE (C-12), DOL state-claims breadth (C-13), FAO food + Apartment List +
  Manheim licensing reads (C-14). Brent/diesel: skipped, marginal over WTI.

### 12.4 UI rebuild charter (MRI-R39; W11-H)

Operator verdict accepted: the modal is 13 identically-styled stacked
sections — a wall, not a desk. Rebuild per the UI audit (RR-1..RR-15):
**5-tab modal** — OVERVIEW (large tabular point, SVG interval cone with
same-basis benchmark ticks [RR-9], expectation/trend/coverage chips, one-line
vs-benchmark delta) · MODELS (benchmark strip incl. expanding_mean, model-
comparison dot plot on one shared axis: champion filled / v3_factor hollow /
cpi_bridge diamond / mf_energy triangle, whiskers where available [RR-10];
market-implied in its OWN row with explicit basis tag and never on the shared
axis when bases differ [RR-6 — the current YoY-level-next-to-MoM% display is
misleading and is a blocker]) · COMPONENTS (champion attribution, bridge
waterfall, confidence composition) · HISTORY (scoreboard + pinball + per-
cutoff accuracy, revision_lean track record, surprise-anatomy reference,
sparklines once n>0 [RR-12]) · CONTEXT (policy backdrop, reaction
sensitivity, quirk + integrity flags, capture-health strip). Null tabs don't
render. Mobile ≤480px = full-screen sheet, ≥44px tap targets, sticky tab
strip [RR-13, blocker]. Single de-duplicated display-only footnote [RR-2].
4px-base spacing scale, tabular-nums for every figure, one label system
[RR-3/4], chips consolidated to the two R24 chips + coverage dot-meter
[RR-5/11], theme-token backdrop [RR-14], #2083 EN/ZH separation preserved
[RR-15]. Cards stay R24-minimal. Mockup-first; browser-verified at 1280/375,
light/dark, EN/ZH before merge (house UI law).

### 12.5 Execution plan (collision-aware) + comebacks

Round 1 (parallel): **W11-A** ops hardening (sole producer owner; R32–R35 +
pinball/scoreboard + Cleveland join fix + snapshot GC) · **W11-B** restatement
docs + backtest-harness expanding_mean columns + RESULTS regeneration (no
producer edits) · **W11-C** Track T science (new files) · **W11-D** Track R
science (new files + additive output_type=2 collector fn) · **W11-E** Track S
flags/collectors + catalog (owns release_quirks.py) — each with an Opus
review; Fable gates on kill rules. Round 2 (serial): **W11-F** interval
recalibration (engine quantile path, MRI-R30, points byte-identical) →
**W11-G** integration (wire mf_energy shadow + revision_lean + flags +
integrity chip into producer/artifact). Round 3: **W11-H** UI rebuild.
Comebacks: C-10 bridge sub-index vintaging + scope decision; C-11 Philly-Fed
early-benchmark feed; C-12 NY Fed SCE; C-13 state-claims breadth; C-14
licensing reads (Apartment List / Manheim / FAO). Claims 2026-07-09 orphan
must be verified scored after W11-A lands (self-heals via R32a+R32d).

W11-G integration #2153 · W11-H UI #2158. Every lane passed an adversarial
Opus review + fix cycle; two science verdicts were re-rendered after review
caught estimator defects. Outcomes of record:

- **Ops (A).** No-orphan capture law live: catch-up sweep (120d), nightly
  ALFRED refresh for tracked series, `capture_health` on latest.json (verified
  live: it reports the claims 2026-07-09 orphan with reason api_key_absent
  locally; the runner's key + catch-up scores it on the next nightly), TTL
  gates on Kalshi/market-implied, fsync appends, snapshot GC, Cleveland
  benchmark join FIXED (was silently null forever), cutoff labels T-1/early
  scored separately, pinball on the scoreboard. Review caught pinball
  p25/p75 dead-legs (fixture-masked) + false 'late' semantics — both fixed.
- **Restatement (B, MRI-R28/R29).** expanding_mean reported everywhere;
  cpi_core stated honestly (beats strongest naive full, LAGS 2021+); bridge
  "edges champion" formally VOIDED in RESULTS (revision-optimistic inputs).
- **Track T (C, MRI-R36) — mf_energy ACTIVE.** Review proved the WTI
  accumulator never fired (dead mechanism); after the fix (289/292 early
  folds project; no-lookahead spike-test) the corrected run beats the
  strongest naive decisively (T-1 MAE 0.1421 vs 0.2568 full; 0.1794 vs
  0.2524 2021+). Wired as the third cpi_headline shadow. Early-cutoff value
  claim stays descriptive (unmatched-sample caveat printed).
- **Track R (D, MRI-R37) — KILLED, honest null.** The review-caught
  training-label look-ahead had inflated HR 60.1%→56.9%; compliant re-run:
  Wilson LB 50.6% ≤ majority base 54.7% (n=239, first→third basis via the
  new output_type=2 multi-vintage store). revision_lean ships SUPPRESSED
  (artifact carries only lean_display:false + the descriptive level-bias
  annotation). Attempt #2 only via future adjudication. Collector + harness
  remain as durable infrastructure.
- **Track S (E, MRI-R38).** 33-episode surprise catalog + quirk flags
  (active_strike — fires 2023-10 UAW on verified aggregated seeds;
  nfp_preliminary_benchmark — fires 2026-01 on the verified −911k Sep-2025
  preliminary, largest on record; shutdown/census calendars web-verified
  after review caught FABRICATED 2025 dates) + print-integrity chip
  (normal/degraded/disrupted) + TRMM/JTSQUR context series.
- **Recalibration (F, MRI-R30).** Vol-scaled residual quantiles (W=24,
  uniform, one-shot): cpi_core 2021+ coverage 64.1%→81.2%, pce_core
  67.7%→81.5%, nfp 64.6%→81.5% — all falsifier targets back in [70,95].
  Honest cost printed: champion NFP pinball 2.31× worse in 2021+ (COVID
  residuals inflate trailing σ). §6 forward gate governs; any COVID-exclusion
  amendment to σ_t requires a NEW adjudication.
- **Integration (G).** mf_energy shadow wired (cpi_headline now carries 3
  shadows); quirk-flag root-param fix (new flags were silently dead on the
  live path — regression-tested); print_integrity + revision_context on the
  artifact; capture_health extended.
- **UI (H, MRI-R39).** 5-tab modal (Overview/Models/Components/History/
  Context), SVG interval cone with benchmark ticks, model-comparison dot
  plot with basis guard (market-implied off-axis, "different basis" tagged),
  surprise-anatomy mini-table, capture-health strip, mobile full-screen
  sheet, 4px spacing scale, tabular-nums, single footnote. Browser-QA'd
  (desktop+375px, light+dark, EN+ZH) — QA caught the mockup's empty-state
  bug (fixture element ordered after the IIFE) that green tests missed.

Forward clocks: §7 gates unchanged; C-9 promotion now covers v3_factor +
cpi_bridge + mf_energy (champion keeps every card); claims 2026-07-09
catch-up verification on the next nightly; comebacks C-10..C-14 open.

### MRI-R39a operator card amendment (2026-07-10)

Binding operator rework of the Release Radar card layout (the 5-tab modal
from MRI-R39/W11-H is unchanged). Four directives: (1) Compact two-number
layout — line 1: release name + countdown chip right-aligned; line 2: OURS
and EXPECTED columns side-by-side with large tabular-nums (ours 本方 / exp 预期
or bench 基准 labels); line 3: ONE chip only (expectation_read.tag preferred,
else surprise_skew.tag); chevron ▸ corner replaces "tap for detail" text row;
no confidence on card (modal has it). (2) Per-card display-only footnotes
removed; panel-level subline ("Forward model · display-only…") and modal
footnote (rr-modal-do-note) unchanged — honesty law satisfied at panel level.
(3) Expected column source order: (a) expectation_read.expectation_median when
non-null, label "exp 预期", tiny CLE/MKT source tag; (b) else median of
non-null same-basis benchmark_set values (naive_prior, trailing_3m/trailing_4w,
ar_model, cleveland_nowcast, expanding_mean) — market_implied EXCLUDED
(different basis/object), label "bench 基准". Benchmark_only cards (claims):
ours column shows "—", bench-median in expected, compact "benchmark-only 仅基准"
tag replaces italic §6 prose. No_data (retail): compact one-liner "awaiting
data 待数据". NFP None-point: ours "—", expected shown if available.
(4) Default-visible = ALL cards sharing the EARLIEST upcoming release_date;
guard: if none of those have a modelled point, also show the next release_date
that does. All other cards hidden behind "See more (N) 显示更多" / "See less
收起" toggle (vanilla JS, session-only, ≥44px tap target). The word
"consensus/共识" is banned from all card strings (MRI-R5 standing).

**MRI-R39a W11 panel cleanup (2026-07-10):** Inline track-record section (TRACK RECORD header + "Forward accrual began … no scored prints yet." line), the "as of &lt;timestamp&gt;" line, and the redundant footer disclosure ("Model projections · display-only · not investment advice · scored forward in public") removed from the panel body. Track record moved to a top-right button ("Track record ↗" / "评分记录 ↗", id=rr-tr-btn) in the h2 header row; clicking opens a panel-level overlay (rr-tr-overlay) populated via scoreboardBlock(). Panel after change: header (title + track-record button + subline disclosure) → default cards → See more → hidden cards. Path taken: new overlay (no existing standalone track-record page found). MRI-R5/R7 honesty satisfied by retained rr-subline.

## Amendment 2026-07-14 — MRI-R40: input tier + combination layer (post June-2026 CPI post-mortem)

**Trigger:** June-2026 CPI cold print (−0.4 actual vs champion +0.0818; see
defect_notices.json DN-001/DN-002 and PR #2574). The system carried five point estimates
into the print with no mechanism for them to combine: §7's graduation endpoint grants a
badge and never changes the displayed number, and the only promotion concept was full
champion replacement. Working signals (mf_energy, Cleveland) had no pathway to matter.

**Ruling (MRI-R40):**

1. **Input-tier doctrine.** The gauntlet gates OUTPUTS and AUTHORITY, never model inputs.
   A signal may be consumed as a model input without any authority change; the output
   carries whatever authority the output has. "display_only" continues to mean "no
   gate/size/trade authority" — it does not mean "may not be consumed upstream".
2. **Combination layer chartered.** `combined_v1` per PREREG_COMBINED_POINT_V1.md
   (frozen 2026-07-14): shrunk inverse-MAE blend of champion + shadows + Cleveland,
   weights learned on forward scored rows only; dispersion-aware interval (a new
   construction — the executed W11-F interval recal one-shot is untouched). The
   displayed card point sources the blend when available; champion demoted to the
   receipt breakdown. Authority booleans unchanged (all false).
3. **§7 extension — promotion reviews get a clock.** In addition to the §7 badge, the
   scoreboard emits a mandatory `promotion_review` adjudication ticket when any single
   input beats the combined point on n ≥ 12 scored prints. Display-tier is a waiting
   room with scheduled review, not a terminal state. Nothing here changes authority
   booleans (unchanged from §7's final sentence).
