# F01 Credit and Commodity Data-Plane Wiring Trace — 2026-09-06

Packet B-A-F01-2 (lane F01, wave A-spare, Meta-CEO B). Ledger rows: MO-DELTA-008, MO-DELTA-013, MO-PAID-004.

## §0 Scope and authority ceiling

This is a **read pass, not a refactor**. No engine module is edited by this packet.
`authority_ceiling = context_only` for MO-DELTA-008, MO-DELTA-013, and MO-PAID-004 — nothing
named in this trace may be promoted to rank, size, gate, or escalate authority. The existing
display-only ceiling is already coded at `engine/credit_momentum.py:1940`
(`"authority": dict(AUTHORITY_V1)`) and `scripts/build_bonds.py:1116`
(authority default `{rank: False, size: False, gate: False, escalate: False}`). This trace
changes none of that; it only maps what already exists.

## §1 Credit producers — machine-readable table

| module | emitting function (file:line) | artifact written (path, or NONE) | consumer (file:line) | rendered surface (file:line, or NONE) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| engine/credit_momentum.py | `def snapshot(root: str \| Path \| None = None) -> dict` at engine/credit_momentum.py:1568 | (a) data/corp_bonds/credit_momentum.json — `out_path = out_dir / "credit_momentum.json"` at :1995, `out_path.write_text(json.dumps(payload, …))` at :1997. (b) data/corp_bonds/forward_log.jsonl — `_upsert_forward_log` at :780, path `root / "corp_bonds" / "forward_log.jsonl"` at :812, keep-FIRST, nightly-lane gated (`COLLECT_LANE` skip at :803) | scripts/build_bonds.py:550 (`cm_path = data_root / "corp_bonds" / "credit_momentum.json"`) inside `def build_corp_credit_vm(data_root: Path \| None = None) -> dict` at :507; engine/bonds_alerts.py:278 ("Compute debounced state-flip events from credit_momentum.json"), path built at :303, absent-file skip at :306, read-failure warn at :313; scripts/build_bonds.py:1083 `_build_corp_credit_bond_health(cc_vm)` → data/bonds/bond_health.json at :1637 | templates/bonds.html.j2 — hero :691-704, spread gauges :707-726, theme tiles :730-733, ORCL chip :775-782, fallen-angel :792-802, new-issuance :809, FINRA :819-820, maturity wall :848-872. Render call scripts/build_bonds.py:1547 (`env.get_template("bonds.html.j2").render(… cc_vm=cc_vm …)` at :1547-1552), page written `write_page(site / "bonds.html", html)` at :1554. Live page: bonds.html, nav entry templates/_navlinks.html.j2:209 |
| engine/bond_cross_asset.py | `def snapshot(f: pd.DataFrame) -> dict \| None` at engine/bond_cross_asset.py:165; `_beta` :54, `_drivers` :90, `_impulse` :145, `_verdict` :219. Credit leg is HY OAS as the equity canary — module docstring :94 | NONE. The module is a pure function over the caller's frame; it contains no `json.dump`, `write_text`, or path construction (verified by grep over the whole 229-line module). Its output is persisted only by its caller | scripts/build_bonds.py:1485-1486 (`from engine import bond_cross_asset as _bx` / `xasset = _bx.snapshot(f)`), chart at :1462 (`xasset_betas`), persisted at :1572 (`snap["bond_cross_asset"] = xasset`) into data/bonds/bond_health.json (:1637); downstream reader engine/neuralweb/world_state.py:2450-2478 | templates/bonds.html.j2:1023-1036 (`{% if xasset_vm %}`, `{% set xa = xasset_vm %}`, chart `charts.xasset_betas`) |

The `credit_stress` family reaches a user only anonymously, folded inside the drivers rollup. **Principal null:** the credit-stress driver reads a HY-spread leg every night, but no page names it as credit — it only ever reaches the reader inside a combined "what moved markets" summary. |

## §2 Commodity pages — per-page binding (MO-PAID-004 acceptance_test, verbatim)

| page | builder (file:line render call) | engine module chain (file:line imports) | verified? |
|---|---|---|---|
| templates/commodities.html.j2 | scripts/build_commodities.py:1391 (`env.get_template("commodities.html.j2").render(`) | engine.commodity_supply_context :351, engine.commodity_carry_context :427, engine.commodity_mtf :497 and :1043, engine.commodity_conviction :530, engine.commodity_signals :536, engine.commodity_signals/commodity_inputs/commodity_conviction :1199, engine.commodity_alerts :1200, engine.commodity_index :1244, engine.commodity_cycle_state :1268, engine.commodity_confluence :1283, engine.commodity_news :1315, engine.i18n :1354, engine.trend_episode.current_episode :1376. Also writes data/commodity/latest.json for the hub card (module docstring :7) | **YES** |
| templates/commodity_strategies.html.j2 | scripts/build_commodity_strategies.py:111 (`env.get_template("commodity_strategies.html.j2").render(groups=groups, built=built, C=C)`) | `from engine import active_commodity as Ach` :30, `from engine import commodity_strategies as S` :31, engine.i18n :88 | **YES** |
| templates/spr.html.j2 | scripts/build_spr.py:261 (`env.get_template("spr.html.j2").render(`) | `from engine import strategic_reserves as sr` :35 (sole engine producer), engine.i18n :256 | **YES** |

Nav placement (all three already reachable, existing product family, no third header):
templates/_navlinks.html.j2:201 sub-trigger, :203 Commodity Dashboard, :204 Strategies, :205 Strategic Reserves.

**MO-PAID-004's "engine wiring UNVERIFIED" is now VERIFIED for all three pages.** No page is
recorded as unbound.

## §3 Source identity and vendor rights (the half of MO-PAID-004 that stays NULL)

- Credit: FRED/ICE BofA `BAMLH0A0HYM2` (HY OAS) and `BAMLC0A0CM` (IG OAS), mirrored
  data/archive/*.parquet + data/fred/*.parquet — engine/credit_momentum.py:28-29. Equity/ETF
  legs via Yahoo (`_load_yahoo_close` :207, `_load_equity_close` :228).
- Commodity: Yahoo via lib.store — engine/commodity_inputs.py:53 (`df = store.read("yahoo", ticker)`);
  FRED real yields/breakevens/rates/balance sheet + Yahoo DXY per docstring :11.
- SPR: EIA weekly US SPR series data/eia/spr_stocks (kbbl) — engine/strategic_reserves.py:6; only
  US (EIA weekly) and Japan (METI) break out government stocks — :19.

**Printed null, verbatim intent:** This pass identified where each series comes from. It did not
read a single vendor licence or terms-of-use page, so no redistribution right is established here
for FRED/ICE BofA, Yahoo, EIA, or METI. Anyone who needs that answer must read the terms — this
record does not supply it. No licence status may be inferred, including for EIA.

## §4 Single-issuer finding — confirmed narrowly, refuted at plane scope

The ledger's MO-DELTA-008 `missing` cell — "broad HY/IG aggregate credit surface (current instance
single-issuer only)" — is **FALSE AS WRITTEN**. The aggregate HY/IG surface already ships on
bonds.html:

- templates/bonds.html.j2:707-726 — card `{# 3. SPREAD GAUGES (4 chips) #}`, `{% for g in cc_vm.gauges %}`
  at :711, plain-word null state at :723 ("Building history — check back soon.").
- scripts/build_bonds.py:748 `_build_spread_gauges(roster, market, ladder)`; roster keys read at
  :803-806 (`ig_oas`, `hy_oas`, `quality_spread`, `ccc_bb`); chip bodies :813-866; called at :581,
  placed into the VM at :607.
- engine/credit_momentum.py:1951-1956 `"roster": {"hy_oas": …, "ig_oas": …, "quality_spread": …,
  "moodys_spread": …, "ccc_bb": …}`, series loaded at :1596-1597 via
  `_load_archive_merged("BAMLH0A0HYM2", "hy_oas", …)` / `("BAMLC0A0CM", "ig_oas", …)`.
- Aggregate HY/IG also charted: scripts/build_bonds.py:221-222 (`_mser("HY OAS", …, _col(fr, "hy_oas"),
  years)` / "IG OAS").
- Aggregate breadth also ships: templates/bonds.html.j2:819 (`{% if cc_vm.finra %}`) from
  engine/credit_momentum.py:1250 `_load_finra_breadth` and :1437 `_build_own_store_breadth`.

What **is** single-issuer is the ORCL **watch chip** only: templates/bonds.html.j2:775-782,
`{% if cc_vm.watch.orcl and cc_vm.watch.orcl.g_spread_bp is not none %}` → engine/credit_momentum.py:948
`_build_orcl_watch` → scripts/build_bonds.py:1005-1025.

**A fourth credit-labelled surface — missed by §1's producer table — also already ships.**
§1's market_drivers.py row is accurate for that module alone (its own `credit_stress` family
reaches no credit-labelled template), but a *different* module renders a *different*,
explicitly credit-labelled leg: templates/dashboard.html.j2:14029 —
`'E4_credit_stress':       {'en':'Credit stress','zh':'信用压力'},` — and its bilingual scare-tip
blurb at templates/dashboard.html.j2:101-102 (EN `'Credit stress — high-yield spreads (OAS)
widening fast…'`, ZH `'信用压力——高收益利差（OAS）快速走阔、垃圾债跑输国债…'`).
The leg is driven by engine/rates_inflation_command.py:557-575 (`# E4 — credit_stress (weight 1)`,
`hy_oas_z = _safe_get(tx, "breakeven_decomp", "costate", "hy_oas_z")`, `"key": "E4_credit_stress"`),
built by `build_board()` — the artifact function called at scripts/build_rates_command.py:129
(`artifact = build_board()`, imported at :128), which writes `data/rates_command/latest.json`.
That artifact is a different consumer's input, not a render call: scripts/build_site.py:6077-6079
loads the file, :6701 places it in the render context as `rates_command=rates_command`, and
:6802 renders it onto the dashboard page (`env.get_template("dashboard.html.j2").render(**vm,
mode="macro")`) — the same template that carries the E4 label and blurb above. So the
credit_stress *axis*, taken across all its producing modules, is not entirely dark — it reaches
exactly one credit-labelled consumer surface today, by way of the dashboard render, not
`build_rates_command.py` itself.

MO-DELTA-008's `missing` cell is wrong as written. The corrected gap is: no *dedicated* HY/IG
credit page exists — the aggregate gauges live as one card inside bonds.html, not as their own
page. **Revised plane-level conclusion:** the credit_stress axis reaches exactly one
credit-labelled consumer surface (E4 on the rates/inflation command) and no dedicated credit
page — not, as originally stated here, "no credit-labelled surface at all". market_drivers.py's
own `credit_stress` family (§1) still reaches no credit-labelled template under its own name;
that half of the original claim stands. The plane-wide half does not.

## §5 In-flight reconciliation — PR #6904 (mandatory)

Verified 2026-09-06 via `gh pr view 6904 --json …`: **OPEN**, head `claude/mo-b-b1-b-f09-2`, title
"[MO-BB1] B-F09-2: Is the window open for new bond deals? HY/IG credit issuance window gate parallel
to the IPO leg", files include `engine/credit_window.py`, `tests/test_credit_window.py`,
`scripts/build_ipo.py`, `templates/ipo.html.j2`. `engine/credit_window.py` **does not exist on main**
at the time of this pass (verified absent in the working checkout).

(a) On merge the credit plane gains a **fifth** module (§4 already names a fourth,
engine/rates_inflation_command.py, that exists on main today).
(b) Its HY/IG issuance-window read surfaces on **ipo.html**, not on a credit page — so a future
"dedicated HY/IG page" child must not duplicate it.
(c) This trace's module table is dated and will need one line added when #6904 merges.

This section is why the record does not ship stale.

## §6 The bounded build child now scopable

MO-DELTA-008 and MO-DELTA-013 are now scopable as ONE surface question, not two build orders:
given that aggregate HY/IG gauges already ship on bonds.html (§4), that #6904 puts an HY/IG
issuance-window read on ipo.html (§5), and that a credit-stress chip (E4) already renders on
F00's unified dashboard/rates-command surface (§4), the open question is whether a *dedicated*
credit page is warranted at all, or whether the credit axis is already adequately served by the
unified dashboard's existing E4 chip. That surface allocation is the Chairman's F00
unified-dashboard lane, owned by Meta-CEO A — handed to A with the E4 chip's existence disclosed,
not omitted. This packet scopes nothing.

**MO-DELTA-008 and MO-DELTA-013 are NOT closed by this packet. Their acceptance tests (an aggregate HY/IG panel; a dedicated HY/IG dashboard page) are undischarged. Status: read pass done, build child now scopable.**

MO-PAID-004: binding trace discharged, vendor-rights record **not** discharged (§3).

## §7 What this pass could not verify (printed nulls, plain words)

- Vendor licences (§3) — not read.
- Whether market_drivers `credit_stress` reaches any credit-labelled surface — it does not (§1),
  verified by a zero-hit grep, not by reading every template line by line for absence-of-mention.
- Whether #6904 merges as inspected here — it is OPEN as of this pass (§5).
- Runtime artifact presence: `data/` and `site/` were not inspected because those trees are
  omitted in sparse worktrees per the sparse-worktree law, so this trace makes **no** claim that
  any artifact currently exists on disk — only that the named writer writes it at the named line.
