# Mastermind-X — Activation & Funnel (V1)

**Status:** RECOMMENDATION, 2026-08-12. Companion to `MASTERMIND_COMMERCIAL_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
**Scope:** the journey model, activation definitions, time-to-value, onboarding, the watchlist
engine, retention loops, notifications, the daily brief, lifecycle, and churn — with the
measurement for each transition. Event names are defined once in
`MASTERMIND_GROWTH_INSTRUMENTATION_SPEC.md` and referenced here as `event.name`.

**Evidence posture.** Mastermind has ~0 commercial telemetry today: the beacon
(`app/main.py::_MM_EVENT_TYPES`) emits eleven event types, none of them commercial. So every
threshold in this document is a **pre-registered hypothesis with an instrumentation plan**, not
a measured fact, and each is labelled with what would falsify it. Saying so is the point: a
funnel target invented and then quietly forgotten is worse than no target.

---

## 1. PART XXVII — The funnel model

The conventional model — `visit → register → pay` — is wrong for this product, because the thing
that sells Mastermind is *using* Mastermind, and the thing that makes using it valuable is that
it knows what you care about. So the funnel has two extra steps, and both come **before**
registration:

```
    visit
      │
      ▼
  ①  intelligence experienced          ← saw a real, specific, dated read
      │
      ▼
  ②  personal act                      ← typed a ticker, built a list, asked a question
      │
      ▼
  ③  registration                      ← to KEEP ② and to be told when it changes
      │
      ▼
  ④  activation                        ← list + return day + evidence opened
      │
      ▼
  ⑤  upgrade intent                    ← third encounter with one ceiling
      │
      ▼
  ⑥  paid
      │
      ▼
  ⑦  paid activation                   ← used ≥2 paid capability groups on ≥3 days
      │
      ▼
  ⑧  retained
```

The load-bearing claim is that **② precedes ③**. A visitor who has created something has a
reason to register that is about them, not about us. Everything in §4 exists to make ② happen
inside ninety seconds.

### 1.1 Transition metrics and pre-registered targets

| Transition | Metric | Target (hypothesis) | What falsifies it |
|---|---|---|---|
| visit → ① | % sessions with ≥1 `intelligence.viewed` | **60%** | <40% ⇒ landing surfaces are not self-evidently intelligence; fix the surface, not the funnel |
| ① → ② | % of ① sessions with ≥1 `personal.act` | **25%** | <10% ⇒ the create-before-register prompt is invisible or unappealing |
| ② → ③ | % of ② sessions registering within 7d | **30%** | <15% ⇒ the registration reason is not concrete enough; test the four reasons in `…ARCHITECTURE.md` §4.2 individually |
| ③ → ④ | activated / registered, 7-day window | **40%** | <20% ⇒ activation definition is too hard, or onboarding drops people before the watchlist |
| ④ → ⑥ | paid / activated, 30-day window | **8%** | <3% ⇒ the paid promise is not differentiated from Free; re-open the packaging question |
| ⑥ → ⑦ | paid-activated / paid, 14-day window | **70%** | <50% ⇒ the first paid session fails to deliver what was bought |
| ⑦ → ⑧ | D30 retention of paid-activated | **85%** | <70% ⇒ retention loop is absent or the intelligence is not trusted |

These numbers are **priors, not commitments.** They exist so that Week 1 after launch has
something to be surprised by. Revise from data, in writing, in this file.

## 2. PART XI — Activation

### 2.1 The definitions

**Anonymous activation** — a visitor is anonymously activated when, in a single session, they do
any **one** of:
- add ≥3 symbols to the local watchlist (`watchlist.symbol_added` ×3), or
- receive ≥1 chat answer (`chat.answer_received`), or
- open ≥2 distinct ticker pages (`ticker.viewed` ×2 distinct).

*Why:* each is an act of intent that a passive reader does not perform. This is the population
worth measuring registration against — not raw visitors, most of whom bounced off a headline.

**Free activation (the primary activation event)** — a registered Free account is ACTIVATED when,
within 7 days of first visit, **all three** hold:

1. **A saved watchlist with ≥3 symbols** (`watchlist.saved` with `symbol_count >= 3`)
2. **A return visit on a second distinct calendar day** (`session.start` on 2 distinct days)
3. **At least one evidence open** — a receipt, an evidence drawer, a Prophet card detail, or a
   chat answer (`evidence.opened` OR `chat.answer_received`)

*Why these three and not others.* Each covers a different failure mode of "looks engaged but
will not return":
- (1) proves **personalization exists**. Without it the product has nothing to tell them
  tomorrow, so there is no loop to retain.
- (2) proves **habit**, and it is the only one of the three that cannot be faked by a curious
  single session. It is also the single strongest predictor in every consumer-subscription
  literature I would trust, which is why it is the one I would keep if forced to pick one.
- (3) proves they understood **what kind of product this is**. A user who never opens evidence
  has experienced Mastermind as a signal feed, and will churn to the next signal feed. The
  evidence open is the moment the differentiator lands.

**Why a conjunction rather than a score.** A weighted activation score is unfalsifiable in
month one and invites tuning until it says what we hoped. Three binary conditions can be
audited, argued with, and *wrong* — which is the property we need.

**Paid activation** — within 14 days of first payment, the account has used **≥2 of the five
capability groups** (Read / Find / Understand / Watch / Prove) on **≥3 distinct days**.
*Why:* a paid user who only ever opens one surface bought a feature, not a product, and will
churn at renewal. This is our earliest cancellable-intent signal, and it fires ~11 months before
the renewal does.

### 2.2 What we should NOT call activation

- **Signup.** It is a transition, not a state.
- **Any single page view**, including the highest-value ones. A view is not an act.
- **Trial start.** It measures our funnel's persuasiveness, not their understanding.
- **Time on site.** Confusion and engagement produce the same number.

### 2.3 Instrumentation required
None of the three activation conditions is measurable today. Required new events:
`watchlist.saved`, `evidence.opened`, `chat.answer_received`, plus a durable
`user_first_seen_at` on the account. All are specified in the instrumentation document; all are
cheap (the beacon already accepts batched events with a verified `user_id`).

---

## 3. PART XII — Time to value

The current worst case is bad: a visitor from X lands on a page whose chat script 401s, whose
data assets may 401, with no prompt to do anything, and the only conversion path in sight is a
pricing page. Time to first *personal* value: unbounded.

The design targets:

| Horizon | What must be true | Surface responsible |
|---|---|---|
| **First 10 seconds** | They can state what this is and see one specific, dated, checkable claim — **without JavaScript having succeeded**. Server-rendered, above the fold | Deep-link landing surfaces (`…ARCHITECTURE.md` §12) |
| **First 60 seconds** | They have interacted: asked the chat a question, or typed a ticker, or added a name. Nothing has been asked of them | Guest chat (3/day) + the inline "add your tickers" prompt |
| **First 5 minutes** | Mastermind has produced something *about them* — their 3–5 names read against the current regime, with one line about what those names share | Anonymous watchlist + the instant read |
| **First day** | They know exactly what will be different tomorrow and have been told it in one sentence | The "we read your list again tonight" promise + the weekly brief opt-in |

**The rule that follows:** *nothing may be asked of a visitor before they have received
something.* No signup wall before value, no preference questionnaire before value, no cookie or
consent interstitial that blocks the first read. Registration is a *save* action, and a save
action requires something to save.

---

## 4. PART XIII — Onboarding

### 4.1 What exists today
`templates/onboard.js` (3,110 lines) is a five-step sheet — `STEP_ACCOUNT` → `STEP_PREFS` →
`STEP_PLAN` → `STEP_BILLING` → `STEP_DONE` — with modes `signup | signin | upgrade | recover |
reset`. The prefs step asks three things (market focus, theme, trade types), all chip-based, and
carries a visible **Skip** control. Preferences land in `LS_PENDING_PREFS`, the *same* key the
Terminal reads on first sign-in — so cross-surface personalization already works.

**Assessment: the onboarding sheet is good, and it is in the wrong place in the journey.** The
prefs step is genuinely minimal (three taps, skippable) and is not the problem. The problem is
that `STEP_PLAN` and `STEP_BILLING` sit inside the *signup* flow, so a person who wanted to save
a watchlist is walked through a plan chooser on their way to a free account. That is the
"complete signup → choose plan → configure → finally see intelligence" shape the handoff warns
against, and it is happening at the exact moment the user's intent is smallest.

### 4.2 Recommended onboarding

**Anonymous onboarding — entirely implicit.** No sheet, ever. We infer market focus from the
pages they read, horizon from whether they open intraday or weekly surfaces, and interest from
the tickers they type. Zero questions.

**Account onboarding — two screens, both skippable, plan chooser removed.**
1. **Account** (email/Google) — unchanged.
2. **Prefs** — unchanged, and now *pre-filled from behavior*: if they read three China pages,
   the CN chip is already on. Prefilling turns a questionnaire into a confirmation.

`STEP_PLAN` and `STEP_BILLING` **leave the signup flow entirely** and become the `upgrade` mode
only. A free account is created in two screens. The plan conversation happens later, at a
ceiling, with context — which is where it converts anyway (§5).

*Expected objection:* removing the plan step from signup will reduce day-0 paid conversions.
*Response:* it will, and that is the trade. Day-0 conversion from a cold signup is a small
number multiplied by a low-intent population; the same person converts at a much higher rate
three days later at a ceiling they chose to hit. If measured day-30 paid conversion falls after
this change, it is wrong and should be reverted — that test is in §11.

**Advanced personalization — gradual and earned.** Never a screen. It accretes: the horizon
chip appears after the fifth session; the "which of these matter to you" prompt appears the
first time we have five candidate themes from their behavior.

---

## 5. PART XIV — The watchlist as activation engine

This is the most important surface in the funnel, and as of 2026-08-12 its **capture and
state-transfer halves are built and anonymous-capable**. Its *read* half is not, deliberately.

**What exists, as of 2026-08-12:** `templates/watchlist.js` is pure client state in a versioned
`localStorage` blob, with an empty-state that renders **starter chips** validated against the
live index. `templates/watchstore.js` is the Supabase sync adapter; it folds the local blob into
the account on first sign-in via a one-time `mdash.watchstore.folded.v1` marker, inserting only
missing tickers — a merge, not an overwrite.

**It became anonymous-capable that morning, and only just.** Until #5463 all ten of the page's
scripts were default-deny, so anonymous production served a publicly cached husk: no empty
state, no CTA, and zero console errors because nothing ran. `access_shell: anonymous` was true
of the page the whole time and meant nothing — every `*.html` has read that value since the
2026-08-04 ruling, including pages whose every asset 401s. **A shell is not a surface.**

**What is missing now is two different things, and only one of them is an invitation:**

1. **The invitation.** Nothing anywhere in the product tells a visitor to build a list.
   `watchlist.html` is a nav item you must already want.
2. **The read.** The four scripts that would attach Mastermind's signal stack are still gated,
   deliberately: `stockdata.js` because the page's `data_base` shim would otherwise render
   graded per-ticker output — conviction band, ladder state, entry urgency — to signed-out
   visitors, and `watchlist_risk.js` / `risk_core.js` / `factor_exposure.js` because they *are*
   the calibrated decision rule in code form. So an anonymous visitor can build a list, watch it
   persist, and be told nothing about it.

That second gap is the one that matters for this funnel, because "Mastermind immediately
analyzes it" is the step the whole pattern turns on — and it is a **disclosure decision**, not a
boundary edit. The recommendation is to give the anonymous list a **regime-and-context read
carrying no graded per-ticker claim**: what kind of market these names are in, what they share,
what is coming for them. That is buildable from artifacts already public, it needs none of the
four gated modules, and it leaves the calibrated rule where it is.

### 5.1 The flow, and where each step lives today

| Step | Today | Change needed |
|---|---|---|
| 1. User enters a ticker | Works anonymously since 2026-08-12, but only on `watchlist.html` | **Add an inline "add your tickers" module to the deep-link landing surfaces** (theme, cohort, ticker pages) with the page's own names as one-tap suggestions |
| 2. Mastermind analyzes it | **Signed-in only.** The four renderers that attach the stack stay gated for anonymous visitors, by design | Build the **anonymous regime-and-context read** (no graded per-ticker claim) — the disclosure decision above |
| 3. User adds more | Works | none |
| 4. Cross-security relationships | Signed-in only (`watchlist_risk.js` is gated for anonymous) | **Add the one-line "what these three share" read** in the anonymous-safe form. This is the moment that reads as magic and it is one sentence |
| 5. Creates a watchlist | Works, locally | none |
| 6. Register to save | **Missing** | The save prompt, fired on the 3rd symbol or on leave-intent — never on arrival |
| 7. Intelligence changes over time | Engines already do this nightly | none |
| 8. User returns | **Missing** | "Since you were last here" (§7) |
| 9. Advanced analysis → Pro conversion | Concentration/correlation not built | Portfolio intelligence, Wave 3 |

### 5.2 Tiering (see the entitlement matrix for the full table)
Anonymous 5 symbols, local · Free 1 list / 15 symbols, synced · Essential 10 lists / 250
symbols + portfolio + concentration · Pro unlimited + intraday alerts.

**The 5-symbol anonymous cap is a product decision, not a cost decision** — it is the number
where "I have built something" is true and "I have everything I need for free" is not.

*Coordination:* the Watchlist+Portfolio CEO revamp program owns the UI. This document
specifies only the commercial behavior — caps, the save moment, and the sync promise.

## 6. PART XVI — Retention architecture

Mastermind's natural loops are all **overnight state changes**, which is exactly what a
nightly-compute product should sell. The loops, ranked by expected pull:

| Loop | The question | Cadence |
|---|---|---|
| **My things** | What changed in my list / holdings? | Daily, pre-open |
| **Prophet** | What entered, what exited? | Daily |
| **Risk** | What deteriorated? | Daily + on-change |
| **Regime** | Did the market change character? | On-change (rare, high value) |
| **Themes** | What is accelerating? | Weekly |
| **Catalysts** | What is coming this week? | Weekly + T-1 |
| **Market open** | What is the read this morning? | Daily |

### 6.1 "Since you were last here" — the canonical surface

**One surface, computed per user, shown first on return.** Not a feed and not a notification
center: a **diff**, bounded to what changed *since their last session*, ordered by how much it
should change what they do.

Content, in order:
1. **Your names** — state changes on watchlist/portfolio symbols, with the one-line why.
2. **Your themes** — acceleration or deceleration in themes their names sit in.
3. **The market** — regime or risk-state changes, only if there was one.
4. **Coming up** — catalysts in the next 5 sessions for their names.

Rules that keep it honest and keep it from becoming noise:
- **If nothing changed, say so in one line.** "Nothing material changed for your 12 names since
  Tuesday." A product that manufactures a change every day teaches users to ignore it.
- **It is a diff, not a digest.** A user away for a week sees a week's diff, not seven days of
  cards.
- **Every item links to its evidence.** The loop and the trust surface are the same surface.
- **Free gets a weekly version.** A Free user with no reason to return is not in a funnel.

This is the one genuinely new surface the commercial architecture requires. Everything it needs
exists — the engines compute the states nightly, the ledgers are already forward-graded, and the
per-user watchlist is already in Supabase. The work is the diff and the presentation.

---

## 7. PART XVII — Notifications and alerts

**Standard: an alert must earn the sentence "I'm glad Mastermind told me."** If we cannot say
which decision an alert changes, it is a digest item, not an alert.

| Category | Urgency | Channel | Configurable | Entitlement |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Portfolio risk deterioration | **High** | Push + email | Threshold | Essential (EOD) · Pro (intraday) |
| Regime change | High | Push + email | On/off | Free (rare enough to be free, and it is market context) |
| Prophet entry/exit on **my** names | High | Push + email | Per-list | Essential (EOD) · Pro (intraday) |
| Major catalyst on my names, T-1 | Medium | Email | On/off | Free (weekly digest) · Essential+ (per-event) |
| Unusual flow on my names | Medium | Push | Threshold | **Pro only** — this is the timeliness product |
| Theme acceleration | Low | Digest | On/off | Essential+ |
| Watchlist event (target, band change) | Low | Digest | Per-symbol | Free (weekly) · Essential+ (daily) |
| Product/marketing | — | Email | Opt-out | All — and never mixed into the intelligence channels |

**Volume caps, enforced server-side, not by user diligence:** at most 3 high-urgency pushes per
user per day; at most 1 digest per day. A cap that exists only in a settings screen is not a cap.

**Default state is quiet.** New accounts get the weekly digest and regime changes, nothing else.
Every other channel is opt-in from a moment where the user asked for that thing.

---

## 8. PART XVIII — The daily briefing

**Verdict: yes — build it, as the *email body of the same diff* in §6.1, not as a second system.**

The scope justification is that it is nearly free: the diff must exist anyway for the on-site
return surface, and an email is a rendering of it. Building a separate briefing pipeline would
not be justified; rendering the existing diff is.

| | Free | Essential | Pro |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cadence | Weekly (Sunday PM) | Daily, pre-open | Daily, pre-open |
| Your names | Top 3 changes | All | All + intraday follow-up |
| Market read | Regime + risk state | + sector rotation | + flow/positioning |
| Prophet | Entries only | Entries + exits + timing state | + armed triggers |
| Catalysts | — | Next 5 sessions | + earnings intelligence |
| Subject line | Names the single biggest change | same | same |

**The subject line is the product.** "3 of your names changed state; NVDA left the board" earns
an open. "Your Mastermind briefing" does not. Personalization here is worth more than everything
below the fold.

*Timing:* pre-open in the user's own timezone (we already have `market_focus` from prefs and
timezone from the beacon fingerprint). A US-market brief delivered at 06:00 local to a
Shanghai-based user is a brief nobody reads.

---

## 9. PART XXX — Customer lifecycle

Interventions must be **product-led** — a state change inside the product — rather than CRM spam.
One intervention per stage. If a stage needs three, the product is failing at that stage.

| Stage | Definition | Intervention | Channel |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Visitor** | No account | The create-before-register prompt (§5) | In-product only |
| **Registered** | Account, not activated | The single missing activation condition, named: *"You have a list — come back tomorrow and we'll show you what changed"* | In-product + 1 email at 48h |
| **Activated** | §2.1 satisfied | Nothing. Let them use it. Show ceilings when they reach them | In-product |
| **Trialing** | Pro trial active | Day 1: the one thing they came for, set up. Day 5: what they used, and what it costs to keep | In-product + 2 emails |
| **Paid new** | 0–30 days | Paid-activation check at day 14; if <2 capability groups, surface the unused one that matches their behavior | In-product |
| **Paid retained** | >30 days, active | Nothing. Ship. | — |
| **At risk** | Paid, no session in 14d, or paid-activation never reached | One honest email: *"You haven't opened Mastermind in two weeks. Here is what happened to your names while you were away."* — the diff itself as the win-back | Email |
| **Churned** | Canceled or lapsed | Structured reason capture (§10), then a 90-day quiet period. One re-engagement only when something they specifically wanted ships | Email |
| **Win-back** | Churned >90d | The diff for their old list, plus what changed in the product since | Email |

**The at-risk intervention is the one that matters**, and it is the same artifact as the
retention loop. That is not a coincidence — it is the test of whether the loop is real.

---

## 10. PART XXIX — Churn analysis

### 10.1 Capture without annoying
Cancellation flow: **one screen, one required question, one optional field.** The required
question is a single-select with these options, which are the hypotheses we can act on:

1. Not enough value for the price
2. Too expensive right now
3. Overwhelming — I couldn't find what I needed
4. I already have a tool that does this
5. The signals weren't accurate for me
6. I'm not trading/investing actively at the moment
7. Missing something I need (free-text)
8. Something else (free-text)

No retention offer *before* the reason is captured. A discount offered before we know why loses
both the customer and the datum.

### 10.2 Tie churn to behavior
Every cancellation row joins to that user's prior 90 days: paid-activation status, capability
groups used, sessions, alerts received vs opened, the last upgrade context. The analysis
questions that matter, in order:

- Do churners differ from retainers in **paid-activation** (§2.1)? *This is the primary hypothesis:
  if paid-activation predicts retention, it becomes the operating metric for the whole company.*
- Does reason (3) "overwhelming" concentrate in users who arrived on a *broad* surface (macro,
  homepage) rather than a *specific* one (theme, ticker)? If so, acquisition surface choice is a
  retention lever, not just a conversion lever.
- Does reason (5) "not accurate" correlate with users who never opened evidence? If so, the
  accuracy complaint is really a *legibility* problem, and the fix is the evidence surface.
- Does reason (2) concentrate in monthly vs annual? That is a pricing-structure answer, not a
  price-level answer.

### 10.3 The involuntary half
Failed payments are a churn category that is fixable with plumbing rather than product. Stripe
dunning is on by default via the Customer Portal; what we must add is the **in-product** signal —
a persistent, non-blocking banner on a `past_due` entitlement with a one-click portal link.
`app/billing.py` already recomputes `status` from Stripe and busts the cache on
`invoice.payment_failed`, so the state is available; nothing renders it.

---

## 11. Measurement plan and the experiments worth running

### 11.1 What must be instrumented before launch
Without these, none of §1–§10 is measurable. Full definitions in the instrumentation spec.
`intelligence.viewed` · `personal.act` · `watchlist.symbol_added` · `watchlist.saved` ·
`evidence.opened` · `chat.answer_received` · `paywall.encountered` · `upgrade.clicked` ·
`plans.viewed` · `checkout.started` · `checkout.completed` · `trial.started` ·
`subscription.canceled` + reason.

### 11.2 Experiments worth running at ~100 users
Only things with large expected effects and cheap reversal:
1. **Anonymous chat on vs off.** Expected the largest single effect in the funnel. Measure
   ①→② and ②→③.
2. **Create-before-register prompt: on the 3rd symbol vs on leave-intent.**
3. **Deep-link landing (theme/cohort page) vs homepage** for social traffic.
4. **Removing the plan step from signup** (§4.2) — measured on day-30 paid conversion, not day-0.

### 11.3 Experiments worth running at ~1,000 users
5. Free board rows: 3 vs 5.
6. Free chat allowance: 20/wk vs 40/wk.
7. Upgrade copy: contextual (names the thing) vs generic. *Prediction: contextual wins by a
   lot; if it does not, the ceiling we chose is not one users care about.*
8. Trial: 7-day card-required vs the 72-hour no-card Day Pass, as parallel arms.

### 11.4 Decide by judgment, do not test
- Whether trust surfaces are free. (They are. Testing this is testing whether to be trustworthy.)
- Whether trust surfaces carry a "how we grade ourselves" link. (They do.)
- Whether Essential annual should be sold alongside an identically-priced superior product. (No.)
- Button colors, card orders, microcopy — at our traffic these produce noise, and the noise
  will be read as signal.

**Standing rule:** an experiment without a pre-registered metric, a pre-registered duration, and
a pre-registered decision rule is not an experiment; it is a change with a dashboard next to it.
