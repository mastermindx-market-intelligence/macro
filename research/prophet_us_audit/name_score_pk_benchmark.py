"""Frozen-frame P@k benchmark for the name_score composite (US Superintelligence Roadmap §4.4).

THE QUESTION. The US board's displayed ``conviction.score`` IS ``engine/name_score.py``'s
``potential_score`` — ``scripts/build_stock_library.py`` overwrites ``c["score"]`` with
``_pot["score"]`` for backward compatibility — so a multiplicative buy-readiness composite is
live, load-bearing and, until now, unmeasured against the orderings that replaced it. This
instrument ranks the SAME admission cohorts three ways and prints what each one bought.

FRAME. ``data/us_board_ledger/retro_grades.parquet``, ``lane == "buy"``, ``horizon == 10``
(the record basis, the S-A/S-B/S-C frame). Outcome ``excess_spy``; loser threshold stated as
``excess_spy < -3pp at H=10``. Cohort = one ``entry_date`` admission set: every ordering
re-ranks the same names on the same day, so nothing here is an admission study.

THE THREE ORDERINGS
  (a) ``name_score``            the frame's own ``score`` column = the board's displayed
                                conviction score = name_score's ``potential_score``. The
                                identity is VERIFIED in-run against
                                ``data/name_score/us_calls.parquet`` (see ``key_identity``
                                in the results) rather than asserted from the source.
  (b) ``us_prophet_v1_partial`` a PARTIAL, PIT reconstruction of the shipped priority score.
                                ``engine/us_board_rank.py`` (``us_prophet_v1``) was defined
                                2026-08-02, AFTER this frame's era, so no row carries a
                                stamped v1 score — this is an explicit counterfactual built
                                from PIT inputs only, never a recovered stamp:
                                  · signal (30 pts) — tier + tick age RECOMPUTED point-in-
                                    time via ``confluence_tiers.tier_stream`` (the ledger
                                    stamped ``tier_cascade`` on 34/403 rows; stamping began
                                    ~07-16 — the same era-fragmentation the S-B stand-in hit)
                                  · entry  (25 pts) — the ledger's stamped ``entry_status``
                                  · edge   (25 pts) — ``alpha_percentiles`` + ``edge_value``
                                    over the cohort, the module's own functions
                                  · runway (10 pts) — NOT RECONSTRUCTABLE: ``ext_z`` is
                                    absent from the ledger schema. Scored 0 for every row by
                                    the module's own fail-closed rule (unknown evidence never
                                    earns points), so the leg is DARK, not neutral.
                                  · quality(10 pts) — NOT RECONSTRUCTABLE: ``coiled`` /
                                    ``washout_ctx`` are absent. Same treatment.
                                80 of 100 points are attainable. Because two legs are dark
                                for EVERY row they cannot reorder anything — the ranking is
                                signal+entry+edge. Read (b) as "what the reconstructable
                                three-quarters of us_prophet_v1 would have ordered", never as
                                "what us_prophet_v1 scored". The score-leg functions are
                                imported, never re-implemented.
  (c) ``alpha_pctile``          the selection axis alone, as the module's own
                                ``alpha_percentiles`` computes it inside each cohort.

METHOD GUARDS (copied from ``superintelligence_standins.py``)
  · date-demeaned outcomes reported beside raw ones;
  · per-name-first medians reported beside pooled medians;
  · the loser threshold is stated, and medians are reported so no verdict hangs on it;
  · a cohort contributes to P@k only when it holds at least ``2k`` rows, so a "precision"
    can never be an arithmetic certainty from a cohort barely deeper than k. Excluded
    cohorts are COUNTED, never silently dropped;
  · empty denominators print ``null`` with a reason. A null is not 0.5 and not 0.

Exploratory. This ranks the adjudication queue (roadmap §4.4: demote / mine the legs /
keep-with-its-card); it confers no authority on anything and changes no gate.
