# Prophet CN vs US — origination anatomy (parity receipt) — 2026-08-07

**Charter:** operator escalation 2026-08-07 ("Prophet US sucks compared to Prophet China —
figure out why CN is so good"). Anatomy only — no gate/rank change follows from this file.
Measured by an Opus review lane; sibling receipt: `ENTRY_LATENESS_FORENSIC_2026-08-07.md`.

**2026-08-09 revalidation boundary:** the code/store comparison below is retained as a frozen
2026-08-07 selection-anatomy receipt, not a description of current live main after subsequent
ANTICIPATION changes. It is measurement/display context only and cannot change a population,
score, rank, gate, Prophet plan, or Neural Web claim. The outcome-selected 300363 price/return
and legal-band account has been withdrawn because its CN price input was Yahoo-adjusted; that
case supplies no authority to this cross-market comparison.

## Headline

The two systems share ONE indicator engine, ONE tier vocabulary, and a BYTE-IDENTICAL
not_topped veto (same function, same constants: OB=80, BUY_RSI_MAX=65, FRESH_TICKS=2,
MIN_HISTORY=159 — `engine/confluence_tiers.py:428-431`). The divergence is the SELECTION
layer: **CN admits the pre-move patience statuses; US is mathematically incapable of
admitting them.**

- CN live board 2026-08-07: **24/24 rows are `bounce_wait`/`hold`/`wait_pullback`**
  (act_level 0:18, 1:6).
- US admitted set 2026-08-06: **27/27 are `buy_now`/`partial`/`buy_soon`** (act_level 3:24, 2:3),
  because `select_candidates` hard-gates `act_level >= 2` (`engine/prophet_bridge.py:440-449`)
  and `bounce_wait` maps to urgency `caution` → act_level **0** (`engine/entry_signal.py:24-33,56`).
- The US board ALREADY CARRIES 23 `bounce_wait` rows — exactly the cohort CN scores 1.0 —
  all dropped at that gate.

**The entry-value maps were deliberately inverted on 2026-08-04** (in-code note at
`engine/us_board_rank.py:113-117`): CN v3 re-ordered to the measured CN prime-window order —
`bounce_wait 1.0 … buy_soon 0.35` (`engine/china_board_rank.py:96-112`) — on evidence from 407
matured episodes (masterplan §2.3: bounce_wait 6.9% loser rate vs buy_now 30.0%). The US map
kept the trend-tape order (`buy_now 1.0 … bounce_wait 0.35`, `engine/us_board_rank.py:119-135`)
and **the US re-measurement was never run.** Stale provenance string at
`engine/us_board_rank.py:896` still claims "frozen status map, shared with the China board".

## Parity table (dimension | US | CN | anchor)

| Dimension | US | CN | file:line |
|---|---|---|---|
| Candidate lane | `us_standouts.json buy[]` (69) → second stage → 12 plans | `china_standouts.json buy[]` IS the board (24, sector cap 4); no second stage | `prophet_bridge.py:424`; `build_china_library.py:3392` |
| Timeframes | 2D/3D shared cascade | same + **weekly (1W/2W) setup layer** | `confluence_tiers.py:264-290`; `build_china_library.py:2912-2915` |
| Ripening shelf | **absent** (setup_tier imported for 2 display fields) | **live, 32 names** (16 READY / 16 BASING; e.g. "2W MACD ~0.5 bars to cross") | `build_stock_library.py:3586-3592`; `setup_tier.py:53-55,451-453` |
| Veto family | identical | identical | `confluence_tiers.py:428-431` |
| Theme/sector in rank | `theme` in ZERO_SCORE_AUTHORITY (0 pts) | `theme_timing` **15/100 pts** (WARMING/early-cycle-turn 1.0) | `us_board_rank.py:186`; `china_board_rank.py:86,312-350` |
| Theme+member double gate | `subsector_confluence.funnel()` double_buy EXISTS FOR BOTH MARKETS, wired into NEITHER board (display-only consumers) | same | `subsector_confluence.py:318-359,481-501` (docstring `:9-11`) |
| Sector turn | — | `cascade` on sector composite, display re-order only (zero authority) | `china_sector_turn.py:108,55` |
| Score weights | signal 30 / entry 25 / edge 25 / runway 10 / quality 10 | signal 30 / entry 20 / runway 15 / bottom_quality 10 / **reversal_member 10** / **theme_timing 15** | `us_board_rank.py:105-111`; `china_board_rank.py:79-87` |
| Featured statuses | `{buy_now, partial}` | `{bounce_wait, wait_pullback, hold, buy_now, partial}` | `us_board_rank.py:171`; `china_board_rank.py:116-118` |
| Freshness at origination | act_level>=2 (or >=2 OR conviction>=60 in caution), band != low | **no act_level gate**; only buy_now/partial demoted `confirmed_late` at ticks>1; patience statuses have NO tick cap | `prophet_bridge.py:440-449`; `china_board_rank.py:878-886` |
| Re-entry | `TICKER-BULL` blocked while a plan is open | keep-first per (date,ticker) — episodes re-enter | `prophet_bridge.py:318-325`; `china_standout_track.py:556-558` |
| Entry basis | asof close; invalidation = swing/2×ATR14 | **T+1 (H+L)/2**, buy_zone_low/high, `chase_above` guard | `prophet_bridge.py:204-256,332-355`; `china_standout_track.py:101` |

**Live US defect found in passing:** `us_standouts.json lane_counts.featured = 0` — all 69
blocked by `ext_z_unknown` (`engine/us_board_rank.py:86-90`). The featured lane is dark today
with no alarm.

## Top-5 structural deltas (ranked by plausible contribution to CN's earlier entries)

1. **act_level >= 2 admission gate (US-only).** Pure code gate over a status vocabulary both
   markets compute identically; CN features the statuses US drops. Portable outright.
2. **Inverted entry-value map + wider featured set.** Portable mechanism, NON-portable
   evidence: CN's ordering rests on a CN cohort (407 episodes). A US port requires a US
   re-measurement (W7 full-population stamped store makes this runnable now), not copied
   constants.
3. **Weekly setup layer + ripening shelf (CN-only lane).** Market-agnostic math; HK already
   ported it (`hk_board_rank.py:159-168,1063-1233`). The pre-cross bench is structurally
   earlier than anything the 2D/3D grid can print.
4. **Theme timing as a paid rank channel.** Mechanism ports; the edge may shrink — THS concept
   rotation is retail-flow-persistent in a way GICS rotation is not. The true theme+member
   double gate is built for both and wired to neither — not a current CN advantage.
5. **No second stage + episode re-entry.** Under a 12-slot cap fed by a late-status filter,
   "US's first look at a name is systematically its last early look." Confound stated
   plainly: A-share limit-up mechanics make early entry partly a FILL constraint (a locked
   board is unfillable) — expect a smaller effect from a US port.

**Grading confound (binding):** CN grades entry at T+1 (H+L)/2, US at asof close — CN's
measured lead is partly a grading-basis difference; the two ledgers' "days to move" are not
directly comparable.

## 300363.SZ post-selection receipt — `STOP_SHIP_UNVALIDATED_QUANTITATIVE_EXHIBIT`

The earlier exact entry, peak, return, legal-limit, score, and rank-counterfactual figures are
withdrawn. `data/china_stocks` is a Yahoo `auto_adjust=True` plane and cannot establish nominal
CNY ticks or an exchange legal-band event. Exact revalidation requires authorized TuShare
unadjusted `daily` joined one-to-one with vendor `stk_limit`, followed by bounded integer-cent
checks and `high_cents == up_limit_cents` / `close_cents == up_limit_cents` equality.

One qualitative lineage warning remains useful: same-date candidate/shadow and board stores
carried contradictory eligibility views, and their keep-first records were not bound to one
common run identity. That is a bookkeeping defect hypothesis only. The name was selected after
its outcome was known, no execution receipt was found, and neither the stored row nor this case
can establish that CN is a better selector or authorize a US/HK port. See
`research/cn_prophet_audit/CASE_300363_FULL_CHAIN_2026-08-08.md` for the binding quarantine.
