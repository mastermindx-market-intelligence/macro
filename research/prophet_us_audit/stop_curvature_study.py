"""Stop-curvature context study — the pre-registered §6.8(a) curvature audition.

CHARTER (BINDING): ``research/prophet_us_audit/STOP_CURVATURE_CHARTER_2026-08-11.md``.
PARENT:            ``research/prophet_us_audit/EARLY_ADMISSION_BAKEOFF_2026-08-11.md``
                   (§R4/R4b strict-form kill, §R9 controls, §RT red-team record).

WHAT THIS IS. R4b killed the §6.8(a) conditioning hypothesis *as pinned* — "1D MACD-RSI
histogram already rising (2-step) at stop confirm" — on rarity (110/12,786 = 0.9%), on
low-marking (23.6% vs 35.0%, month-cluster CI −11.4pp [−19.2,−2.8]) and on forward tape.
That kill closes the strict-rising CONSTRUCTION only. The operator's described form —
"arching up off the histogram low" — is a curvature/above-trailing-min construction the
strict lens cannot express. This script is that family's one pre-registered pass, forms
K1–K5 exactly as charter §2 enumerates them, on the pre-declared primary cells.

WHAT THIS REFUSES TO DO.
  * No form outside the enumerated five gets a classification rule or an outcome read.
    Any new form is a NEW charter (charter §2 last line). There is no search here.
  * No best-cell promotion. Grids are sensitivity-only and printed in full; every gate is
    judged on the pre-declared primary cell (charter §4.4).
  * No outcome column is readable before the G5 exemplar gate has concluded. That is not
    a convention here, it is enforced: the outcome columns live inside ``OutcomeVault``
    and every read before ``vault.unseal()`` raises. The ordering and its wall-clock
    timestamps are printed in RC.g5 so the sequence is auditable from the output alone.
  * No null is softened. A form that fails is a COMPLETED result: its row lands in the ore
    ledger, the construction closes, the family stays open ("not found yet" ≠ "does not
    exist", house epistemics law).

EXTRACTION (single path, no second lane). The frame is the R4 replay's frozen
``early_admission_bakeoff_stops.parquet`` (12,940 confirms). It carries point-in-time FLAGS
only — no per-bar histogram series — so K1–K3 need the 1D histogram path recomputed. The
recomputation reuses the parent's OWN loader (``early_admission_bakeoff.load_ohlc``) and
the same engine primitives ``NameData`` used (``engine.signal_quality._rsi_macd`` for the
1D MACD-RSI histogram, ``_tf_grid``+``_rsi_macd`` for the session-anchored 3D leg), and it
is GATED: RC.parity must reproduce the stored ``hist_rising`` AND ``close`` columns on every
row of the frame or the run aborts (exit 3).

Both legs are needed and neither is sufficient. ``hist_rising`` is a strict-ORDERING
predicate — invariant under any positive affine transform of the histogram — so it pins the
replay's ordering while K1 (``hist < 0``, ``hist > tmin``) and K3 (normalized recovery) are
level-dependent; a uniformly shifted histogram would sail through it and move K1's coverage.
The stored ``close`` supplies the level identity that the ordering leg cannot. Together they
establish that the recomputed series is the replay's series; separately, each leaves a hole.

3D PHASE (charter §2 K4 dependency / §4.6). The defect the parent found in R4.hl_phase is
charting-app ``confluence_v2``'s first-timestamp-phased ``resample`` — MACRO-side the 3D
grid has been absolutely session-anchored since ``ANCHOR_ERA=sq-abs-session-2026-08-06``
(``engine/session_anchor.py``), so the stored ``m3_bull`` column already IS the
session-anchored recomputation. This script proves that rather than assuming it: it
rebuilds the session-anchored leg independently (RC.parity row 2) AND rebuilds a
first-timestamp-phased leg mimicking the defect, and prints the divergence (RC.parity
row 3) — a material phased-vs-anchored divergence is itself a finding (charter §4.6).

Usage (defaults are the parent run's own roots — the store is frozen at 2026-08-10):

    # ---- lens C: real events, BREAK DEPTH held fixed within quintiles ----
    # THREE disclosures this lens must carry, all of them load-bearing (red-team R1):
    #  (i)  SUBSTITUTION. Charter §4.2 registers *entry-distance* quintiles, and the parent
    #       bins on `entry_vs_low` — an EPISODE quantity ("stop DISTANCE held roughly
    #       fixed", early_admission_bakeoff.py:1222-1230). A stop-confirm frame has no
    #       entry, so this bins on break depth at the trigger bar instead. That is a
    #       different quantity: it is NOT stop width, and a result from it may not be
    #       described as stop-width arithmetic.
    #  (ii) OVER-CONTROL. Break depth is outcome-correlated (the per-cell near-low rate
    #       falls monotonically across the quintiles — printed below): a hard break is
    #       mechanically likelier to BE the window low. Conditioning on it removes label
    #       variance from every cohort, real or spurious, so a shrinking spread here is
    #       weak evidence about the effect and strong evidence about the binning variable.
    #  (iii) ESTIMATOR FRAGILITY. With a thin TRUE arm the cell-inclusion rule and the
    #       weighting rule move the answer by ~2x. All four combinations are computed and
    #       printed; NONE is designated primary, because the charter pre-registered neither.
