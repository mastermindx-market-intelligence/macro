# US Prophet Live — Wave A incident evidence freeze (2026-08-26)

Read-only forensic bundle captured before any production modification by this session.
Commission: `PROPHET-US-LIVE-FORCE-MAJEURE-2026-08-26-FABLE-HANDOFF`.
Workstream: `WS:PROPHET-US-AVAILABILITY`. Shared boundary: `WS:BREATHING-PLATFORM`.

## 0. Headline correction to the commission's stated window

The commission (§3.2) records "observed user-facing last-good period: August 21, 2026"
and scopes the at-risk sessions to **Aug 24 + Aug 25**.

First-hand runtime evidence shows the outage is **27 days**, not 5:

> `live_flow/prophet_live.json` has not been written since **2026-07-30T17:20:56Z**.

The Aug-21 observation was not the freeze onset. Roughly **18 NYSE sessions**
(2026-07-31 → 2026-08-25) published no US Prophet Live artifact.

## 1. Runtime identity (captured 2026-08-26 ~07:46-08:10Z)

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Host | `ubuntu-s-mastermindx` (146.190.142.17) |
| `/opt/macro` HEAD | `1db8306293fdb3514e9b50d9bb236962c6169c96` (== `origin/main`, not drifted) |
| `macro-live-prophet.timer` | `enabled` + `active` |
| Last trigger | 2026-08-25T21:58:02Z |
| Next elapse | 2026-08-26T13:03:03Z |
| `Persistent` | `no` — **correct, unchanged** (commission D11) |
| Service last result | `Result=success`, `ExecMainStatus=0` |
| Unit env wiring | `EnvironmentFile=-/etc/macro-live.env` — present and honoured |

**The timer was never dead.** The producer ran every 5 minutes throughout the outage
and exited 0 on every pass. This is the silent-freeze class, not a scheduler fault.

## 2. Initiating fault — credentials were never seeded at cutover

`/etc/macro-live.env` (mode 600 root:root) carries an in-file comment:

> `R2 credentials for the Prophet Live product lane — seeded 2026-08-26 from`
> `/etc/macro-api.env (same bucket, already provisioned). Cutover 2026-07-30 installed`
> `the unit but never seeded these, freezing live/prophet_live.json for 27 days.`

Corroborating timeline, independently established from runtime evidence:

| Timestamp (UTC) | Event |
|---|---|
| 2026-07-30T13:38:25Z | last `workflow_dispatch` of the GitHub backstop — success |
| 2026-07-30T17:20:08Z | **last GitHub backstop run that actually executed** (id `30565510113`) |
| 2026-07-30T17:20:56Z | last write of `live_flow/prophet_live.json` (`status=dark`, 355 B) |
| 2026-07-30T18:03:09Z | **first** `no R2 credentials` warning on the VPS lane (oldest journal entry) |
| 2026-07-30 → 2026-08-26 | every subsequent GitHub scheduled run `completed/skipped` |

The 2026-07-30 cutover made the VPS the primary writer (backstop self-disabled per
commission D6) and handed the lane to a producer that had **no credentials to publish
with**. `r2io.client()` returns `None` when `R2_ENDPOINT` / `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` /
`R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are absent, and `r2_put_json` returns `False` rather than
raising (`engine/prophet_live/r2io.py:58`, `:111`, `:133`).

**Credential state at capture:** all four keys (`R2_ENDPOINT`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`,
`R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `R2_BUCKET`) present and non-empty; `PROPHET_LIVE_NO_PUBLISH`
absent; no `export` prefixes (systemd-parseable). Secret values never read or printed.

**Attribution honesty:** the seeding at `/etc/macro-live.env` mtime
`2026-08-26T07:43:28Z` happened ~3 minutes **before this session's first VPS
connection** (07:46:36Z). This session did **not** perform it. The SSH key
fingerprint and egress IP in `auth.log` match this operator machine, so the act
originated here (operator or sibling session), but it is **unattributed** and was
not recorded in any PR or Agent OS record at capture time.

## 3. Second, independent defect — armed-pack `as_of` mis-stamping

The evaluator darkens a session when the pack's `as_of` is not the last completed
NYSE session. Journal census of every `artifact dark (stale_pack)` reason:

| Session | pack `as_of` | expected | mis-stamp mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-03 | 2026-08-01 (Sat) | 2026-07-31 | weekend |
| 2026-08-04 | 2026-08-04 | 2026-08-03 | same-day |
| 2026-08-05 | 2026-08-05 | 2026-08-04 | same-day |
| 2026-08-06 | 2026-08-06 | 2026-08-05 | same-day |
| 2026-08-10 | 2026-08-09 (Sun) | 2026-08-07 | weekend |
| 2026-08-12 | 2026-08-10 | 2026-08-11 | one session behind |
| 2026-08-13 | 2026-08-13 | 2026-08-12 | same-day |
| 2026-08-17 | 2026-08-17 | 2026-08-14 | same-day |
| 2026-08-18 | 2026-08-18 | 2026-08-17 | same-day |
| 2026-08-19 | 2026-08-19 | 2026-08-18 | same-day |
| 2026-08-24 | 2026-08-22 (Sat) | 2026-08-21 | weekend |

Totals across the outage: **924** `stale_pack` dark passes, **29** `no_pack`.

Origin: `scripts/build_prophet_live_pack.py:167` derives `tip = AP.as_of_date(series.values())`
— the pack stamp is the **tip of the loaded close series**, so a same-day or weekend
row in the close store propagates straight into `as_of`. This is an upstream close-store
/ tip-selection defect, **not** a live-lane defect.

Consequence: on these 11 sessions the evaluator's `dark` verdict was **correct given the
pack it was handed**. Publication alone would not have produced signal.

## 4. Session classification (drives lawful backfill scope)

Journal coverage is **continuous** across 2026-07-30 → 2026-08-26 (no rotation gap;
3.2 G retained). Sessions split cleanly:

**Class R — genuine evaluation, publication lost (infrastructure loss):**
`2026-07-31, 08-07, 08-11, 08-14, 08-20, 08-21, 08-25` — **7 sessions**, each with a
full 84-pass in-window series carrying `pass=` lines (states, pack/quote clocks) and
per-name `EVENT` lines. Example (2026-08-25T20:23:07Z):
`pack_as_of=2026-08-24 quotes=2081@2026-08-25T20:22:30Z src=vps_local states={'dark':74,'unknown':30,'forming':28,'dormant':29,'near':7,'at_risk':9} events=65`

**Class D — correctly dark on a mis-stamped pack:**
`2026-08-03, 04, 05, 06, 10, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 24` — **11 sessions**. No genuine
transitions existed to lose.

**Partial:** 2026-07-30 tail after 17:20:56Z (≈13:21–16:15 ET) — lost mid-session.

## 5. Adjudication against the force-majeure DEC (commission §C0)

`DEC-FORCE-MAJEURE-SESSIONS-ARE-BACKFILLED-BY-DEFAULT` authorizes reconstruction of
**infrastructure loss**, explicitly not data-correctness laundering.

- **Class R = infrastructure loss.** Correct pack, correct quote tape, correct state
  machine, correct verdicts — only the PUT was impossible. Backfill lawful.
- **Class D = data defect.** Recovering these requires minting a *differently stamped*
  pack that never existed in production and replaying a counterfactual. Commission §C2
  forbids exactly this ("refuse the backfill rather than minting a wider 'better'
  historical pack"). **Refuse**, and route the pack defect to its own repair.

This is a split verdict against stop-condition §24.1: it is triggered for Class D only.

## 6. Defect disposition (commission D1–D11)

| ID | Status at capture |
|---|---|
| D1 external dead-man does not grade US `prophet_live` | **CONFIRMED** — 27 days green while frozen |
| D2 `/api/status` omits `prophet_live` | **CONFIRMED** |
| D3 evaluator returns 0 on unexpected failure | **CONFIRMED** as amplifier |
| D4 missing R2 creds warning-only | **CONFIRMED — this was the initiating fault** |
| D5 live PUT failure warning-only | **CONFIRMED** (not exercised; creds absent earlier) |
| D6 GitHub backstop self-disables under VPS primary | **CONFIRMED** — correct design, fatal in combination |
| D7 armed-pack publication can fail quietly | **CONFIRMED + WORSE** — see §3, silent mis-stamp |
| D8 spool absence ≠ no passes | **CONFIRMED** — 0 spool objects, ~1,500 in-window passes |
| D9 two-writer CAS on `prophet_live.json` | intact; no third writer introduced |
| D10 reconciler sole `data/prophet_live/` writer | intact |
| D11 `Persistent=false` | intact (`Persistent=no`) |

New: **D12 — armed-pack `as_of` inherits a bad series tip** (§3).

## 7. Restoration precondition verified (read-only)

R2 write capability re-tested with the now-seeded credentials via a namespaced
diagnostic key (`live_flow/_diag/prophet_live_write_probe.json`): `PUT_OK` →
`READBACK_OK` (88 B) → `PROBE_CLEANED`. No product object touched.

Today's pack is correctly stamped — `live_flow/prophet_live_armed.json`
`as_of=2026-08-25`, `LastModified=2026-08-26T04:49:32Z` — which equals the last
completed session for a 2026-08-26 trade date, so today is **not** exposed to D12.

Natural first in-window pass expected ≈2026-08-26T13:28Z (09:28 ET). Production proof
per commission §9 requires two consecutive natural invocations and is **not yet held**.

## 8. What was lost

- **Product:** US Prophet Live strip served a `status=dark` document stamped
  `2026-07-30` for 27 days.
- **Evidence:** the prospective intraday transition record for the 7 Class-R sessions
  never reached R2, so `data/prophet_live/forward.parquet` never accrued them.
  The producer's own journal retains `EVENT` lines for those sessions — a
  contemporaneous first-hand record, materially stronger than PIT reconstruction.

## 9. Not done / open

- Production proof (§9) — pending the 13:28Z natural pass.
- Wave B permanent fail-closed + dead-man coverage — not yet built.
- Class-R recovery method (journal-derived vs PIT replay) — not yet adjudicated.
- D12 pack-stamp repair — owner not yet assigned.
- The unattributed 07:43Z credential seeding needs an operator acknowledgement.

---

# 10. Wave C feasibility — what the journal can and cannot do

## 10.1 The commission's mandatory control cannot be run as written

§13 requires replay output to be compared "against the real R2 event spool" for a
known-good session. **Zero spool objects exist for any session in the outage** —
the evaluator only spools when it can publish, and it could never publish
(commission D8 in its strongest form: absence of spool proves nothing, and here it
also removes the specified control substrate).

## 10.2 The producer's journal substitutes for that control

The systemd journal retains, continuously from 2026-07-30, one `pass=` line per
in-window pass plus one `EVENT` line per transition. Measured against §13's own
minimum acceptance list, the journal supplies:

| §13 acceptance requirement | Journal supplies |
|---|---|
| exact genuine event identity set `(ticker, kind)` | yes — 598 distinct keys over 7 sessions |
| no spurious extra transition keys | yes — the set is exhaustive per pass |
| internal vs public transition kinds agree | yes — `crossing_unconfirmed` / `at_risk_unconfirmed` are logged distinctly from `forming` / `at_risk` / `confirming_into_close` |
| first transition in the same pass bucket | yes — journal timestamps are the real pass times |
| pack / session / quote clocks agree | yes — `pack_as_of`, `session_et`, `quote_asof` per pass |
| price-basis audit decisions agree | yes — `basis levels=… checked=N unchecked=N mismatched=N` per pass |

Recoverable volume, by session (distinct `(date, ticker, kind)` — the reconciler's
exact merge key):

| Session | keys | Session | keys |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-31 | 90 | 2026-08-20 | 71 |
| 2026-08-07 | 15 | 2026-08-21 | 31 |
| 2026-08-11 | 162 | 2026-08-25 | 86 |
| 2026-08-14 | 143 | **total** | **598** |

Kind distribution across the outage: `forming` 16,634, `at_risk` 5,872,
`confirming_into_close` 2,140, `crossing_unconfirmed` 1,016,
`at_risk_unconfirmed` 296 (line counts, not distinct keys).

## 10.3 …but the journal is a CONTROL, never a ledger SOURCE

An earlier reading of this evidence treated the journal as stronger than replay
because it is first-hand. That is true as *evidence of what happened* and false as
*ledger input*. The logged line is a lossy projection of the event row:

```
prophet-live EVENT {kind} {ticker} px={price} from={from} passes={passes} age={quote_age_min}m
```

`live_states.transitions()` builds rows carrying `ticker, ts, session_phase,
price, quote_age_min, passes, from, entered, kind` and optionally `via`. Two
load-bearing fields are **absent from the log**:

- **`entered`** — the field that separates a genuine intraday CROSS from a board
  member's first-pass reading. Its own source comment records the P0 receipt as
  "~108 board rows to 2 crosses", i.e. without it the headline population is
  silently the non-crosses.
- **`via`** — the fall-back-vs-overrun axis, and for the internal markers the
  suppressed-pass side that the public row deliberately omits.

`ts` and `session_phase` are recoverable (both are pure functions of the pass
clock). `entered` and `via` are not; they are state-machine outputs.

**Conclusion:** journal-derived rows cannot be written to the forward ledger.
The journal's correct role is the §13 known-good control that the missing spool
can no longer provide — which is exactly what unblocks a replay-based Wave C.

## 10.4 Historical armed packs do not exist — the live §24.2 risk

For session D the evaluator needs the pack armed at D-1's close. Retention probe
against the production bucket:

- `get_bucket_versioning` → **not enabled**
- `list_object_versions` → `NotImplemented` on this R2 bucket
- `live_flow/prophet*` holds exactly **3** objects: the frozen live doc, ONE
  current `prophet_live_armed.json` (`as_of=2026-08-25`), and `prophet_marks.json`

So no historical pack bytes are retained anywhere in R2. Every Class-R session
would need its pack reconstructed from the exact prior-session Git/data vintage.
§C2 warns precisely against assuming that reproduces: the production builder is
wall-clock budgeted (`max_seconds` in `config.yml`) and can withhold names on
deadline, so an unhurried later machine may mint a WIDER cohort than production
actually armed — and a wider pack manufactures transitions that never existed.

**This is stop condition §24.2 in a live state, not a hypothetical.**

## 10.5 The fidelity test that would settle it

The journal makes the refusal decidable rather than a judgement call. Each
in-window pass records the realised cohort:

```
prophet-live basis … checked=105 unchecked=72 mismatched=1
states={'dark':109,'dormant':25,'near':10,'unknown':10,'forming':23}
```

`checked + unchecked` is the armed cohort size and the `states` map sums to it, so
a reconstructed pack can be tested against the size production actually armed,
per session, before any replay runs. Gate:

1. reconstruct pack at D-1 vintage;
2. **reject** unless cohort size matches the journal for that session;
3. replay the real `engine.prophet_live.live_states` over a delay-respecting
   historical quote view;
4. **reject** unless the produced `(ticker, kind)` set equals the journal's set
   exactly — no spurious keys, no missing keys;
5. only then are that session's rows lawful input for the existing reconciler.

Any session failing 2 or 4 is **refused**, not widened.

# 11. Recommended disposition (for Sol)

> **Superseded in part by §15.** The table below was written before the Chairman
> exercised authority to backfill. Waves C/D resolved differently than recommended
> here, and for a reason worth keeping: the blocker was pack RECONSTRUCTION, and the
> executed path reconstructs nothing. Left in place because a disposition that was
> revised is more useful than one quietly rewritten.

| Wave | State |
|---|---|
| A — forensics + restore | **PROVEN_LIVE** (§14) |
| B — silent-freeze elimination | **PROVEN_LIVE** — #6464 + #6482 merged, deployed, red-and-green both demonstrated (§14.1, §14.2) |
| C — PIT replay | **not built, and not needed**: recovery from the producer's own journal reconstructs no pack, so §24.2 never binds (§15.1) |
| D — backfill | **EXECUTED** on Chairman authority — 598 rows, 7 sessions (§15.3) |
| E — acceptance + records | done |

Class-D's 11 sessions are **refused** on the force-majeure DEC's own terms: their
`dark` verdicts were correct for the pack handed to them, so "recovering" them
means minting a pack production never armed. That is data manufacture, not
infrastructure reconstruction.

# 12. Two items needing an operator/Sol act

1. **Unattributed credential seeding.** `/etc/macro-live.env` gained the four R2
   keys at mtime `2026-08-26T07:43:28Z`, ~3 minutes before this session's first
   VPS connection. This session did not do it. It needs acknowledgement and an
   Agent OS record, because it is currently the single most load-bearing
   production change in this incident and it has no carrier.
2. **D12 ownership.** The pack `as_of` mis-stamp is an upstream close-store /
   tip-selection defect. It darkened 11 sessions and will recur. PR #6464 makes it
   VISIBLE (`pack_ok`, graded by the dead-man) but deliberately does not repair it.

---

# 13. D12 refined — mechanism confirmed, trigger not reproducible today

`engine/prophet_live/armed_pack.py:855 as_of_date()` takes the **MAX last-bar date
across the whole universe**, deliberately ("the pack must say what it is actually
armed on"). The consequence is a single-point fragility: **one** contaminated
series sets the stamp for all ~3,000 names, and the evaluator then darkens the
entire next session because that stamp is not the last completed session.

Journal evidence of contamination is unambiguous — tips landed on **Saturdays**
(2026-08-01, 08-09, 08-22) and on the build's own calendar day (08-04/05/06/13/
17/18/19). A Saturday bar in a US close store is not a defensible reading.

**But it is episodic, and today's pack is clean.** Probe of the live
`prophet_live_armed.json` (`as_of=2026-08-25`, `built_at=2026-08-26T04:49:31Z`):

| `bar_date` | names |
|---|---|
| 2026-08-25 | 3,034 |
| 2026-08-24 | 4 |
| older (08-10, 06-26, 05-07, 05-13) | 1 each |
| **ahead of `as_of`** | **0** |

So the mechanism is proven and the *source* of the ahead-dated bars is not
identifiable from a clean pack. Naming a culprit today would be a guess.

**D12 repair implemented — BUILT_NOT_PROVEN (2026-08-27).** Operation
`prophet-us-d12-pack-tip-hardening-20260827-sol-001` confirmed the proposed direction
but found one important correction: capping only `as_of_date` is insufficient.
`armed_pack.session_lag()` intentionally returns zero when a name's last bar is at or
ahead of the selected tip, so a contaminated name could still enter the signal gate
even if the published stamp were repaired. The US pack owner now obtains the canonical
`last_completed_session(now)` bound, quarantines any series whose FINAL index is a
non-NYSE session, later than that bound, or malformed/NaT, and only then selects the
raw pack tip and submits valid names to the gate. It never trims and reuses a bad
series. Rejected names publish `skip=invalid_series_tip` as an explicit stale/non-
verdict. Shared `engine/prophet_live/armed_pack.py` is unchanged, preserving CN calendar
semantics and honest stale-store behavior.

TDD/proof receipts:

- binding owner-bound RED `33068839608`: **5 failed / 2 passed** before the US
  admission helpers existed; the two passes pinned the existing completion clock and
  shared calendar-neutral `as_of_date` behavior;
- committed-head GREEN `33069264975`: **8/8**;
- mutation run `33069337428`: deleting only `not is_session(day)` made the
  Saturday-before-bound case select `2026-08-01` instead of `2026-07-31`; mutation
  killed;
- cross-market run `33069685528`: **81/81** existing US + CN armed-pack tests;
- hostile NaT RED `33069928015`: **1 failed / 8 passed** with a real
  `TypeError: Cannot compare NaT with datetime.date object`;
- one-line fail-closed repair committed as
  `e2d612e4bd3b2dbddff4b25103c09aac3dc7434d`; apply run `33069998807` held **9/9**
  before commit.

This is not yet production acceptance. After merge/deploy, the first **natural** US
pack/evaluator cycle must prove the canonical completion bound and pack stamp, explicit
invalid-tip degradation if any exists, no global `stale_pack` darkness, and external
`pack_ok=True`. Do not seed a bad production row merely to exercise the negative case,
and do not manually dispatch `prophet-live.yml` while the VPS timer is primary.

# 14. Production proof — 2026-08-26 NYSE session (commission §9)

The lane published for the **first time since 2026-07-30T17:20:56Z**. Captured
13:37Z from first-hand host state, not from CI.

| § | Requirement | Observed |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | timer enabled + active | `enabled` / `active` |
| 2 | two consecutive natural invocations | `13:28:05Z`, `13:33:05Z` (no manual dispatch) |
| 3 | `pass_ts` advances on cadence | 13:28:05 → 13:33:05 |
| 4 | `session_et` = current session | `2026-08-26` |
| 5 | `pack_as_of` = last completed session | `2026-08-25` = `expected_session` |

| — | `/api/status` projection | `expected_now=True status=live pack_ok=True pass_age_min=4.6 quote_age_min=5.3` |

Events resumed accruing immediately: `events=25` on the 13:28Z pass and `events=15`
on 13:33Z — prospective intraday evidence is flowing into the spool again.

## 14.1 What the proof caught that CI could not

The external dead-man went **red** on the same capture:

```
VPS LIVE UNHEALTHY:
- prophet_live: missing producer (unowned lane)
```

PR #6464 graded ownership identity — which the commission requires (§B2) and the
breadth lane already carries — but nothing on the producing side ever wrote the
field, so the check could never go green. That is the same always-red-therefore-
unread failure #6464 had to heal in the public-live inventory guard, reintroduced
one layer over. Repaired in PR #6482 by stamping `meta.producer` after the single
`LS.evaluate` call, so globally dark artifacts are owned too.

**This is the entire argument for §24.10.** Every check in #6464 was green, the
mutation matrix passed against pristine code, and the defect was still there. Only
a real session against real production surfaced it.

## 14.2 Closure — heartbeat green in a live session

`meta.producer` shipped in PR #6482 (`e01895f5fcc4`) and deployed mid-session.
Re-verified at 15:23:00Z, inside RTH, with the lane actively publishing:

| Surface | Observed |
|---|---|
| served artifact | `status=live`, `pass_ts=2026-08-26T15:23:00Z`, `producer=scripts/prophet_live_evaluator.py` |
| `/api/status` | `expected_now=True status=live pack_ok=True pass_age_min=2.5 quote_age_min=3.2 n_names=180` |
| external dead-man | **`VPS live plane healthy`** (exit 0) |

Both halves of the contract are now demonstrated on the same lane, in production:
the dead-man **red**s a non-publishing lane (13:37Z capture) and **green**s a
publishing one (15:23Z) — which is what makes it an instrument rather than a
decoration.

Note on verification method: `git merge-base --is-ancestor` against `/opt/macro`
answers "not deployed" for a merge SHA it has not fetched — the box is a partial
clone and main moves faster than the 3-minute pull, so the box holds a
*descendant*, never the exact SHA. Deployment must be confirmed from the deployed
FILE and the artifact it produces, never from ancestry alone.
# 15. Backfill EXECUTED — Chairman authority, 2026-08-26

§10.3 concluded the journal was a control and not a ledger source, because `entered`
and `via` are absent from the logged line. On Chairman authority to backfill, that
conclusion was re-examined and is **partly superseded**. The corrected finding:

- `via` is genuinely unavailable and stays null (it is optional on genuine rows too);
- `entered` is **not** a price-derived quantity. It is
  `bool(pack[ticker]["center_buyable"])` (`live_states.py:576`), fixed for a whole
  name-session and carried forward — so it is recoverable wherever production's OWN
  output settles it, with no replay and no reconstructed pack.

## 15.1 Why this is RECOVERY, not replay

Every row absorbed was emitted by the production evaluator at the time and read back
verbatim. No state machine was re-run, no quote tape was rebuilt, and **no armed pack
was reconstructed** — which is exactly why §24.2 (no surviving pack bytes) does not
bind this path. There was nothing to mint.

The committed recovery corpus is the source boundary, not an unscoped host-journal
count. Its immutable gzip contains **588 pass records: exactly 84 on each of the seven
Class-R sessions**. Those passes declare **25,958 events** and the gzip carries exactly
**25,958 `EVENT` lines**, with 0 mismatched passes and 0 orphaned lines. The producer
timer is `:03/5`; the single canonical ET window is 09:25 through 16:15 plus 10 minutes
of end grace, which admits exactly 84 scheduled ticks per EDT session (13:28Z through
20:23Z). The per-session census therefore closes whole-pass completeness, while the
`events=N` equality closes intra-pass completeness. The earlier **672 passes** claim in
#6484 prose is not reproducible from the committed gzip and is superseded for recovery
source-integrity claims. `scripts/prophet_live_journal_recovery.py` still refuses
(exit 3) on any mismatch, orphan, or branch contradiction.

## 15.2 How `entered` was recovered without guessing

`at_risk` / `at_risk_unconfirmed` are emitted **only** inside the `if on_board:`
branch (`live_states.py:616-654`); `crossing_unconfirmed` **only** in the cross branch
(`:698`). One such event therefore fixes that name's whole session.

| | names | rows |
|---|---|---|
| determined `board` | 118 | 269 |
| determined `cross` | 23 | 23 |
| genuinely undetermined → **null** | 153 | 306 |
| **contradictions** | **0** | — |

Zero contradictions across 141 determinations is the check on the branch mapping.
Names that only ever emitted `forming` / `confirming_into_close` occur on both
branches and are left null — inventing them would silently decide the ledger's
headline cross-vs-board population (§16: absence means no claim).

## 15.3 Absorption

Staged as a bounded pending input outside canonical `data/prophet_live/`, then
absorbed by the existing reconciler, which remains the sole writer (LEDGER LAW D10).
`scripts/reconcile_prophet_live.py` gained exactly one new entry point, `--pending`,
fail-closed on schema, filename/session disagreement, row/session disagreement,
missing identity, and the `LEDGER_FLOOR_SESSION` floor. Pending and R2 spool are
mutually exclusive in a run, so "which source wrote this row" stays answerable.

**`data/prophet_live/forward.parquet` did not previously exist** — never committed, no
history. The ledger's floor is `2026-07-30`, the very day the lane broke, so the
evidence base had been empty since inception. These are its first rows.

| Result | |
|---|---|
| rows | **598** (90 / 15 / 162 / 143 / 71 / 31 / 86) |
| duplicate `(date,ticker,kind)` | 0 |
| `close_same_day`, `confirmed` | 598 / 598 |
| `next_close_fill` | 512 / 598 — the 86 open are exactly Aug 25, maturing on the next close |
| confirmation basis | 6 sessions `replay` (vintage-truncated gate), Aug 25 `pack` (as_of matches) |
| `cross_px` null / ≤0 | 0 / 0 |
| `first_ts > last_ts` | 0 |
| rerun | idempotent on every field except `reconciled_at` |
| blast radius | ledger + recovery dir only — no board, rank, plan or site mutation |

Count agreed independently three ways before any effect: journal census (598),
recovery tool per-session distinct keys (598), reconciler dedupe (598).

## 15.4 What the rows honestly do NOT claim

All 598 carry `pct_basis = unaligned_no_anchor` and a null `cross_basis_close`. That
is the reconciler's own designed answer for a row first written from an older session
(`reconcile_prophet_live.py:128`): the basis anchor is only valid if read
contemporaneously on the cross's own session, and taking a later close would assume
no distribution in between. Disclosed, never repaired by guess.

Class D's 11 sessions remain **refused** and unchanged (§5). Their `dark` verdict was
correct for the pack they were handed; recovering them would require minting a pack
production never armed, which is the one thing the force-majeure DEC does not cover.

## 15.5 Reproducibility

The committed journal (`journal_2026-07-30_2026-08-25.txt.gz`, 197 KB) plus the
recovery tool regenerate the pending input byte-for-byte. `_recovery_receipt.json`
records sha256 `d3812a0cec8f50dff57523ffa7163c65d3a3f058da56286fa368185b74156a52`
for the **uncompressed source text** supplied to the recovery tool; the committed gzip
archive bytes hash to sha256
`2d1f429993fd555482ff3887f5dca13eb8825313be9dcbd702f091d52636884e`.
The two hashes name different representations and must not be conflated. The 10 MB
expanded pending is deliberately NOT committed — stage-and-absorb, not a persistent
queue (§14).

## 15.6 Final maturation — 2026-08-27

The initial absorption in §15.3 was intentionally honest about 86 rows from the
2026-08-25 session whose `next_close_fill` was still null. The ordinary nightly had
already run before #6484 created the ledger, so those rows missed that one normal
maturation pass; this was a sequencing residue, not missing market data.

Sol re-ran the **existing canonical reconciler logic** (`maturing_rows` →
`_expand_maturing` → `merge_ledger`) against the committed Aug-26 close series. All 38
open ticker/session pairs had a 2026-08-26 close. The deterministic closeout produced:

- 38 pair updates → exactly **86 row updates**;
- **598 rows before and after**;
- **0 duplicate `(date,ticker,kind)` keys**;
- `next_close_fill`: **512/598 → 598/598**;
- every matured Aug-25 row has `next_close_date=2026-08-26`;
- **0 `FIRST_WINS` fields changed** and `entered` did not change;
- the 153 undetermined name-sessions remain unknown (`entered=null`), never cross;
- final ledger sha256
  `fb25fcc6b1935d9fdd5e7e2a6e8a5981411acda6825784afb241eceba968c5e0`.

The durable machine receipt is
`data/pit_replay/prophet_live_recovery/_closeout_receipt.json`. Class D remains
refused; no replay, pack reconstruction, board/rank/plan/site mutation, or third ledger
writer was introduced.
