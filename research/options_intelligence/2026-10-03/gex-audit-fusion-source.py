"""US Prophet C1 evidence-family fusion — the LIVE board ranker (``us_prophet_v3``).

WHAT THIS IS.  One vote per evidence FAMILY, equal weight, no fitting beyond a
within-night normalization.  Per member: the cross-sectional percentile rank
(average ties) of the value oriented by its REGISTERED sign.  Per family: the mean
of its present members' percentiles.  The fusion score: the equal-weight mean of the
present family scores, on a 0-100 scale.

WHERE IT CAME FROM, AND WHY THE MATH IS NOT RE-DERIVED HERE.  This is the C1 rung of
``WS:PROPHET-CONDITIONAL-FUSION`` — raced frozen and non-promotion-bearing in PR-1b
(#5667) as ``scripts/prophet_fusion_race.build_c1``.  The Chairman override of
2026-08-15 made it the canonical US board ranker, which means the construction had to
leave ``scripts/`` for an engine module the nightly may import.  The port is an
EXTRACTION, not a re-implementation: :func:`aggregate` is byte-parity-pinned against
``build_c1`` over the frozen research frame by
``tests/test_us_prophet_fusion.py::TestByteParityWithTheRacedC1``.  Production code
never imports ``research/`` or ``scripts/``; the parity TEST does, which is the only
place the two are allowed to meet.

THE TWO HALVES, KEPT APART ON PURPOSE.

  * :func:`admit_members` — the FLOOR evaluation.  Which registered members are
    allowed to vote on a frame, on two axes: PRESENCE (coverage) and VARIANCE.
  * :func:`aggregate` — the C1 arithmetic, over an already-decided admitted set.

They are separate functions because the frozen race and the live board evaluate the
FLOORS over different frames while running identical ARITHMETIC.  PR-1b's race
computed coverage over its whole 24-date frame — lawful for a frozen counterfactual,
and a look-ahead if a live board did it, because tonight's ranker would be consulting
a member's coverage on nights that have not happened.  #5700 named the prospective
form as unfinished work and PR-3's shadow lane inherited it.  The Chairman override
needed it BEFORE that lane, so it is implemented here: the live board calls
:func:`admit_members` with tonight's pool as the whole frame, and the parity test
calls it with the frozen 24-date frame and reproduces the race exactly.  One code
path, two frames.

THE AS-OF-NIGHT VARIANCE FLOOR (the derivation, so a reader can check it).  The
registered law (``research/prophet_fusion/families.yml`` ``variance_floor_spec``) is:
count, per date, the DISTINCT non-null sign-oriented values among that date's rows; a
date "carries variation" when that count is >= 2; a member is VOTE-INERT on the frame
when the share of frame dates carrying variation falls below 0.50.  On a ONE-DATE
frame — which is what a live board is — that share can only be 1.0 or 0.0, so the
rule collapses without loss to: *a member votes tonight iff tonight's pool holds at
least two distinct non-null oriented values for it*.  Nothing is relaxed and no
threshold is re-chosen; the general rule is evaluated on the frame the board actually
has.  This is the axis that PR-1b measured and could not act on: ``news_burst`` fired
on 19 of 1,493 graded rows, its within-date percentile was a near-constant, F8's
leave-one-family-out delta was exactly 0.000 with CI [0, 0] — and the 0.50 PRESENCE
floor admitted it anyway, because presence cannot see a column that is present and
constant.

NULL IS NOT ZERO, AT EVERY LAYER.  A member with no reading for a row ABSTAINS: its
percentile is null and the family mean is taken over the members that did answer.  A
family with no surviving member is ABSENT and is listed with its reason.  A row with
no family at all is scored ``None`` — never 0.0 — and the board's sort puts it after
every scored row in its stage bucket rather than pretending it earned the bottom
score.  A night with no surviving family at all is a REFUSAL
(:class:`FusionUnavailable`), which the board answers with an explicitly stamped
degradation mode, never by quietly ranking on something else.

WHAT MAY NEVER ENTER (:data:`FORBIDDEN_INPUTS`).  Cross-desk COUNTS of agreeing
evidence (``confluence_k``, ``altdata_conv_gte2``) are the anti-double-count budget
spent as one vote, which is the thing the family construct exists to forbid.  The
champion's own composites (``potential_score``, ``conviction``, ``name_score``,
``score``) are BASELINES: a baseline ingested as evidence cannot be beaten by
anything, it is merely re-fit.  Reaching the feature path with one of these raises.
