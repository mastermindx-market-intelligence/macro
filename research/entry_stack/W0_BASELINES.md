# W0 Incumbent Baselines — Entry-Stack Expansion

**Status:** W0 recompute under the program grader (RUL-9).
All numbers here use `engine.grading` barrier definitions:
- Rotational: liftoff 1.08×, horizon 21d, stop 0.95×, cushion 1.05×
- Positional:  liftoff 1.15×, horizon 126d, stop 0.95×, cushion 1.05×

Wave1-era numbers (clean15=1.20+durable-hold) are historical context only
and may NOT satisfy any promotion bar (RUL-9).

## Statistical notes

### days_to_10 — descriptive only, excluded from FDR promotion panel

`days_to_10` (median bars to +10% gain) is computed and reported in the era × tier
tables as a descriptive speed metric.  It is **not** included in the `effect_table`
BH-corrected FDR panel.

Reason: `days_to_10` is defined only for fires that *reached* +10%, making it a
selection-biased (collider) outcome.  Whether a fire ever reaches +10% is itself
a near-equivalent of the positional-liftoff endpoint.  Conditioning on "reached +10%"
opens a selection channel: the stratum coefficient in the conditional population is
not a clean causal stratum effect.  This does not affect the primary endpoint
(`stop5`) or the other FDR-panelled outcomes.

Correct interpretation: the `days_to_10_median` column in the era table shows the
**conditional speed** (given the fire reaches +10%), stratified by era and tier.
Comparison across tiers should be read as "among fires that did reach +10%, how
quickly did each tier reach it?" — not as an unconditional stratum causal effect.

## Deferrals

### NC-2 Entry Quality Bands (RUL-3)

**DEFERRED to W1/S-UR study PR.**

`engine.cycles.entry_quality()` requires per-fire computation of cyc/mtf/early/regime
dicts — each a full cycles.py call chain — making per-fire band assignment too heavy
for W0 baseline computation (~224 tickers × ~38k fires on deep panel).

The hook is present in `r1_estimate(entry_quality_bands=True)` and the loader
interface is defined (pass `eq_band` column in graded DataFrame). The NC-2
marginality test (coefficient survives eq-band FE) runs in W1 when the first
candidate study generates per-fire eq-band labels efficiently (e.g., as a
batch-computed lookup table per ticker×year-quarter).

### COILED/COILED-FIRE Recall Recompute

**DEFERRED to S-UR study PR.**

The COILED state is computed via engine/cycles.py which requires the full
per-ticker cycle state stack. Recomputing recall under the program grader
requires running the full cycle pipeline over all fire dates — scoped to
the S-UR phase0 PR where the COILED∩S-UR intersection is the primary subject.

## RUL-7 THRESHOLD FREEZE (W0 GATE)

**Date:** 2026-07-05
**Reviewer:** W0 opus stats reviewer (Entry-Stack Expansion program)
**Verdict:** FREEZE AS REGISTERED. All §5 promotion bars freeze as written; no arithmetic impossibility found.

### Frozen CHIP floor
- **CHIP/STRATUM primary endpoint: stop5 FE-coefficient ≥ 2pp** (block-bootstrap 95% CI excluding 0). **Held at 2pp — not raised.** Per RUL-7 the reviewer may raise, never lower; raising is declined because the recomputed baselines corroborate the ~5.5pp winner-scale rationale (one-third ≈ 2pp) and the CI-excluding-0 + BH q≤0.10 + sign-stable-3/4-eras + beats-both-NCs + MFE/|MAE| conjunctive hurdles already carry the precision/multiplicity burden.
- All other §5 numbers (n≥400 arm, SPECIES non-inferiority CI-lower > −1pp + superiority CI-excluding-0 on ≥1 axis, HYGIENE CI-excluding-0 degradation + ≤10% vetoed volume, trial budgets summing to 115) freeze as registered.

### Spot-recompute results (deep panel, independent regrade via engine.grading over gate_fires_deep.parquet + data/stocks)
| Cell | Registered | Recomputed | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total fires | 38,250 | 38,250 | exact |
| Gradable | 37,722 | 37,719 | −3 (maturity-boundary snapshot noise) |
| Tier-summary stop5 T1 / T3 | 11.6% / 13.0% | 11.6% / 13.0% | exact |
| 2012-2015 T1 (n / stop5) | 3384 / 6.2% | 3384 / 6.2% | exact |
| 2016-2019 T1 (n / stop5) | 3363 / 7.5% | 3363 / 7.5% | exact |
| 2020-2022 T1 (n / stop5) | 2644 / 14.6% | 2644 / 14.6% | exact |
| 2023-2026 T1 stop5 | 9.7% | 9.7% (n 2724 vs 2727) | ~3-fire boundary |

Baseline tables reproduce; sub-0.01% deltas are ~3 fires at the 126-bar maturity cutoff from a marginally newer snapshot, not error. Estimator verified sound: stop5 window = 5 forward bars from fill (matches registered endpoint); bootstrap p-value is a percentile CI-inversion consistent with the CI-excluding-0 bar; BH is standard.

### Caveats binding W1
1. **The 2pp floor is enforced by the CI hurdle, not by n=400 alone.** At n≥400/arm with baseline stop5 ~12%, the difference-SE ≈ 2.3pp; a true 2pp effect will rarely clear CI-excluding-0 at minimum n. W1 studies must not read a bare 2pp point estimate as a CHIP pass — the CI-excluding-0 clause is operative and implies effective n well above 400 for a 2pp effect.
2. stop5 (5-forward-bar MDD) is distinct from terminal_state STOPPED (full-window). The registered CHIP endpoint is stop5; W1 reports must not substitute STOPPED incidence.
3. Absolute rates are survivor-biased (deep panel = surviving names); per-program law, only within-arm comparisons are valid — carry the survivor stamp on every W1 absolute.

## RUL-14 Note — Vol-Scaled Entry Zone Co-Primaries (B1 PR, 2026-07-05)

**Source:** Amendment 1 §C1, esx/b1 PR.

Two new co-primary outcomes are live in `scripts/research/entry_strata_phase0.py`
from this PR forward and appear in every subsequent `grade_fires()` call:

| Column | Definition |
|---|---|
| `vol_band` | `sigma20 × sqrt(20)` clamped to `[0.05, 0.15]`, computed from trailing 20d close-to-close daily return std at the fill bar (strictly prior bars only). `None` if fewer than 21 trailing bars. |
| `zone_held_21` | `1` if `min(close[fill+1..fill+21]) > fill_price × (1 − band)`, else `0`. `None` if `vol_band` is `None` OR fewer than 21 matured forward bars. |
| `stop_vol_21` | `1 − zone_held_21` (kept explicit for table symmetry). `None` when `zone_held_21` is `None`. |

Both `zone_held_21` and `stop_vol_21` participate in the BH panel per RUL-14,
exactly like `stop5`.  They are reported as co-primary beside `stop5` in every
subsequent study (W2 onward).

**W1 grandfathering:** W1 studies dispatched before this PR (esx_ev_blackout, esx_ts_adx)
are grandfathered — `zone_held_21` / `stop_vol_21` will be computed at adjudication
by re-running `grade_fires()` on their fire sets with the updated harness.

**No existing metric altered.** RUL-7 is not triggered: the addition is purely
additive (new columns; all pre-existing columns, definitions, and promotion bars
are unchanged).  The clamp arithmetic `[0.05, 0.15]` and the 20-bar window are
frozen from this date; any future change requires a new ruling logged here per RUL-7.
