## P3b — Routing placebo

**Seed:** 20260704  **Draws:** 200  **Exclusion zone:** ±10 sessions  **Runtime:** 0.94s

> Verdicts in this section are left as **PENDING ADJUDICATION**.
> PASS rule (G1-routing): real cell mean > 95th percentile of 200 placebo means
> (one-sided; sign = sign of real mean as stored in graph_m.json — see code comment).
> FIX 2: pseudo-onsets sampled from regime-matching dates, count-matched to cell's
> regime-filtered real event count (cell_n from graph_m), not total source onset count.
> FIX 5: cells with fewer than 200 valid draws are marked insufficient_placebo and
> automatically fail G1-routing regardless of their placebo p95.
