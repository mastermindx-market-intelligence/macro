# Experiments audit — 2026-09-02 (10 ready results checked and adjudicated)

Successor to `research/EXPERIMENTS_AUDIT_2026_08_26.md` (72 results) using its §9
method: lane workers re-derive each "ready" experiment's real state from artifacts
only (seed prose never trusted), the orchestrating session adjudicates and writes the
seed. Registry set: `site/marketdata/experiments.json` as of 2026-09-02 — 274
tracked, 10 flagged ready in the admin Experiments panel (4 cortex hypotheses,
2 vector/BTC track-records, 2 setup species, 1 thematic-desk track-record, 1 frozen
phase-0 backtest). Three Opus analyst lanes + one Sonnet builder lane, orchestrated
by Fable. No promotions, no demotions, no DNR kills: every read below is
display-tier, and per house law these are instrument-window verdicts, never market
verdicts.

## 1. Cortex hypotheses (4) — the repaired instrument declines to grade three; the H5 pass is formally fenced

The 08-26 audit's §3 found five evaluator wiring defects; #6503 repaired them
(evaluator now `W7b-PR3`) and built the quarterly FDR batch (`scripts/
quarterly_cortex_fdr.py`, riding weekly.yml). Today's read, from live dry-runs of
both instruments (`python3 -m scripts.evaluate_cortex_hypotheses --dry-run`;
`python3 -m scripts.quarterly_cortex_fdr --dry-run`):

- **H2 high_alibi (`…-898d24`, due 09-02)** → `invalid-gate`: threshold −0.05 is
  outside hit_rate's attainable range in absolute space — the 08-05 re-registration
  carried the same W3 gate shape the audit predicted would fail identically.
  Terminal for this registration; a corrected gate requires a NEW registration
  (Article 7 — the evaluator never rewrites a pre-committed gate).
- **H3 stopped-heterogeneity (`…-b2727c`, due 09-02)** → `invalid-gate`
  (threshold 1.01 > attainable 1.0). Same disposition.
- **Quad-unsupported (`…-4a6d7e`, due 09-02)** → `uncomputable-metric`: its gate
  metric `difference_in_mean_5d_signed_excess` is not in the W7b-PR3 metric enum
  (registered 08-21, before registration-time enforcement landed 08-26). Same
  disposition: re-register with a supported metric (`excess_mean_difference` is the
  matching shape).
- These three verdicts are written by the NIGHTLY (sole advancer of the machine
  registry); all three statuses are terminal in `metabolism.TERMINAL_STATUSES`, so
  they stop flagging on their own once the nightly's evaluator step next runs with
  them due. This audit deliberately writes no ledger rows for them.
- **H5 decay-flag (`…-1bf548`, flagged since 08-26 as the one unconsumed pass)** —
  its consumer now exists and REJECTS it: the 2026Q3 FDR batch fences the 07-13 pass
  with `no evaluator_version recorded (pre-repair verdict)` (1 candidate,
  0 eligible, 0 survivors). Adjudication: **superseding row appended** retiring the
  pass as a pre-repair instrument artifact (W7b-PR2-era, no p-value, trivially
  passable absolute floor per audit §3 W3); re-arm = NEW registration under W7b-PR3
  semantics via the Batch B re-registration lane (`rf-batch-b-cortex-watch`, 09-09).

Registry-mechanics fixes in this PR (same class as 08-26 §0):

1. **The cortex hook did not know the W7b-PR3 terminal statuses** —
   `engine/experiments_registry.py::_refresh_cortex_evaluator`'s `status_map`
   defaulted `invalid-gate` / `uncomputable-metric` / `unresolvable-query` /
   `invalid-self-reference` / `expired-insufficient-n` to "accruing", so tonight's
   three terminal verdicts would have presented as live accruals forever (not
   ready-flagged — terminal rows have `come_back` cleared — but mispresented).
   All five now map to `no_go`, pinned by
   `tests/test_experiments_registry.py::test_cortex_terminal_statuses_all_read_as_concluded`,
   which walks `metabolism.TERMINAL_STATUSES` so a future terminal status cannot
   regress this silently.
2. **`budget-rejected` is terminal in metabolism but mapped "accruing"** — same
   defect, same fix (→ `no_go`), caught by the same test.

Watch items (recorded, not fixed here): (a) the first post-repair weekly FDR
artifact has not landed on main — `data/neuralweb/cortex/fdr_batches/` does not
exist and no weekly.yml deep-dive commit appears around Saturday 08-29; verify next
Saturday's run writes `2026Q3.json` (the local dry-run proves the batch itself
works). (b) `evaluator_run.json` is only written when ≥1 row is due
(`evaluate_due` early-returns), so "ran, nothing due" and "never ran" leave the same
committed trace; the 08-18 receipt is therefore healthy, but the gap is the same
observability class the cancel-invisibility law names.

## 2. thematic-desk — the "inverted" finding is UNREPRODUCED, and independence, not n, is the variable

n tripled (50 → 161 decided) while honest independence went 1 → 2 windows — the 161
[entry, check_by] windows form ONE unbroken overlapping chain 06-18→08-31
(overlap-connected components = 1). The artifact's `independent_blocks=3` is an
interval-scheduling capacity count whose 3 selected windows contain 3 theses (1.9%
of the cohort) — the 08-03 come-back's premise ("n→150, blocks→3-4") was wrong in
construction. The strongest honest partition is two disjoint generations and they
DISAGREE: G1 (n=51) dir 0.412 below the 0.5125 null; G2 (n=20) dir 0.600 above it;
the 90 straddling theses (dir 0.311) carry the aggregate and sit inside the one
July–mid-August theme drawdown. Verdict: hold display-only, do NOT tilt and do NOT
trade the inverse; re-read 10-13 when a THIRD disjoint generation first exists.
Fix scoreboard since 08-03: (c) placebo-null-beside-hit-rate LANDED
(`c2a4dac54456`); (a) expired counter NOT landed — the uncounted-rows leak grew
8 → 12 (URNM/CIBR/IBIT cohort); (b) priceable-proxy gate NOT landed, and a NEW
failure mode was found: IBIT's series exists but ends 06-15, so the gate must
require a bar at/after the prospective check_by, not series existence. REMX
resolved itself (parquet now present, both theses graded).

## 3. species-S6 / species-S13 — every blocker still present; both convert to event-driven cadence

Zero commits have touched either species since 08-03 (`git log --since=2026-08-03
-- research/species/ data/species/` is empty). S6: the bound ledger still
physically cannot store an S6 row (closed 10-code `REJECTION_TAXONOMY`, validator
hard-reject, sole near-miss writer emits two signal_gate codes) — near-miss rows
grew 73 → 148 over two more months with species_id non-null on 0 of 59,691 ledger
rows; the phase-0 result remains unreproducible from tracked state (/tmp fire
parquets gone, hardcoded roots). S13: all three required panels remain absent,
untracked and gitignored (`.gitignore:192-195`); `assert_no_gate` is still a
private substring blocklist reached by no caller input; the 3-vs-2 trial-count/DSR
divergence stands. Both come_back_note predicates fire → per their own prescription
both entries convert `cadence: monthly` → `event_driven` with `come_back_on: null`
(precedent: macro-tx-phase0's nulled come-back, 08-26 audit §0): S6 re-arms on the
first non-zero S6 forward row, S13 on panel availability. S6's next_step now names
the fork honestly: UNBLOCK (a §8-signed taxonomy extension is an adjudication act)
or propose a KILL-or-park rather than carry a third structurally-guaranteed null.

## 4. vector-btc-impulse — the motivating gate FAILED on leak-free labels; the seed was carrying pre-fix numbers

The seed's "historical gate all_pass=true (d2 4.43/d3 2.67/u1 6.37)" was refuted by
the repo itself 63 days before the come-back date: `83a74313859d` (2026-07-01,
PR #808) replaced a leaking label (`close.shift(-1).rolling(H).min()` included
close[t-1]/close[t]) with a strictly-forward one, and `impulse_legs_gate.json`
(asof 09-01) now reads **all_pass=false** — d2/d3 demoted on edge (holdout lifts
1.84/1.187), u1 insufficient_n (lift 1.699, p .002, 14 of 30 holdout fires). The
08-31 come-back question ("confirm first live act-tier fires landed") answers NO
structurally: `_gate()` forces a demoted leg's `fired_today=False`, so the
falsification ledger records 0 fires on all 51 rows and can never accrue live
evidence to re-promote a demoted leg. Status → **blocked**; re-read 12-01 on the
repair gate, not maturation (u1's holdout floor is a 2028-2029 question).

**Live honesty defect (flagged for a separate fix, chip filed):**
`engine/btc_alerts.py:415` reads the UNGATED `fire_series`, so two `tier:"act"`
alerts published live in-window (06-29 d2; 08-19 d2 — 49 days post-demotion)
carrying "a verified LEADING precursor cross" on a demoted leg. Also recorded:
Phase-1 component ledger = radar/decay/falsifier/staleness-fix shipped, alerts
shipped-defective, gauges + June-24 confession exist in JSON only — **zero
templates reference the radar**, so nothing user-visible renders it.

## 5. spvector-overlay — the row fused three different objects; re-keyed and split

The old row's `source` named the S&P LLM knife-veto overlay, its `what/maturation`
described a BTC 5d-regime study with a row schema that has never existed
(`{regime, vector_state, realized_5d_return}` — actual rows carry no forward field
at all), and its merge premise ("same accrual clock" as vector-btc-impulse) is
refuted by 48/51 vs 0/55 matured on different horizons (3d vs 90d). Adjudication:
**keep two rows, mint a third** —

- **`btc-regime-ledger`** (re-keyed from `spvector-overlay`): 55 rows / 10
  contiguous band episodes; falsifier correctly n_matured=0 (first 90d window
  closes 09-18 — though its honesty_note's "ledger is empty" is wrong prose over
  55 rows); `score()` — the only code producing per-tier stats — is wired into no
  workflow. Come-back 09-25 on the first-maturation gate. The audit's own 5d read
  is recorded as NOT a result (TAILWIND = one 3-day episode).
- **`spvector-llm-veto-overlay`** (minted): 332 rows, 0 vetoes — structurally
  uninformative because `shock_reversible=="unknown"` on 332/332, so the veto
  branch is unreachable on live data; plus an undeduped bare-append log. Come-back
  12-01 on the shock_reversible gate.

## 6. s-mlc-3-weekly-wait-cost — harness built and run; Outcome A (COST-IS-REAL), floor clearance knife-edge and printed as such

The frozen prereg (`research/S_MLC_3_WEEKLY_WAIT_COST_PREREG.md`) finally got its
harness (`scripts/s_mlc_3_weekly_wait_cost.py`, +20 pure-function tests) and ran on
the full 1998→2026 SPDR history. Primary cell (δ=0, 21d, t+1-close fills, SPY-parked
non-confirm): mean SPY-excess cost of the half-now/half-on-weekly-confirm
construction vs full immediate entry = **+0.309% per event** (n=617 events / 238
month clusters, HAC t 6.26, month-block sign-flip permutation p≈0.0000), era split
mandatory and sign-stable (pre-2010 +0.223% t 2.15; post-2010 +0.344% t 6.02),
split-half and episode-first-month blocks agree, BH-FDR primary cell survives,
confirm-miss rate 46.5%, δ=0.01 sensitivity +0.339% (NON-PROMOTABLE, same
direction). **Verdict per §3: Outcome A — COST-IS-REAL**, so a leaders-exception
pre-reg is authorized (a separate document; no wiring — this study gates authority
only and the display tier was never gated).

**Adjudicated ambiguity (verdict-affecting, printed not hidden):** §1.5's raw
formula compares the confirm Friday to `close[s,t]` (event day), while BOTH frozen
blocks (Ruling 3 at line 100, Ruling 4's miss branch at line 105) say "weekly close
≥ **t+1 entry close**". The orchestrator adjudicated the FROZEN blocks as the law
(the 07-16 freeze superseded the draft formula; the builder implemented the same
reading independently). Under the superseded literal reading the cost is 0.296% —
BELOW the 0.30% magnitude floor — so the A/B verdict is knife-edge on this textual
choice and the floor margin is 3% relative. Both numbers ship in
`data/mlc/s_mlc_3_weekly_wait_cost_results.json` (`confirm_reference_ambiguity`,
`verdict_sensitive_to_choice: true`) and the report leads with the caution. The
leaders-exception pre-reg, if drafted, MUST define the confirm reference explicitly
and treat the floor clearance as marginal, not comfortable.

## 7. Method note

Same playbook as 08-03/08-26: lane workers re-derive state from artifacts only and
propose; the orchestrating session adjudicates, spot-verifies lane numbers against
the artifacts, and writes the seed. Statuses stay within the registry vocabulary;
every updated entry carries `state_as_of: 2026-09-02`.
