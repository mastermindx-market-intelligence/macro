# Nightly Resilience & Live-Transition Masterplan

**Date:** 2026-08-06 (commissioned by the operator during the stale-board emergency)
**Status:** Part A = actionable program; Part B = trajectory ruling on top of the
already-ratified live architecture
**Extends:** `research/LIVE_INTRADAY_DASHBOARD_MASTERPLAN_2026-07-29.md` (ratified —
this doc does NOT re-adjudicate it), `research/LIVE_DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md`,
`docs/VPS_LIVE_ORCHESTRATION.md`
**Does not create:** a second forecast engine, a second forward ledger, a SPA
rewrite, or any change to the epistemics laws (display vs authority tiers,
nightly as sole forward-ledger advancer, LLM never originates signals).

---

## §0 ACCEPTANCE GATES (Part A — "never again")

Part A is **not done unless**:

1. **A stale live board alerts a human within 26h, from OUTSIDE GitHub.** A
   sentinel that lives in GitHub Actions is blind to the two outages that
   actually happened (GitHub Actions major outage 2026-08-06; six failed
   nightlies that concluded "red" into a channel nobody watched). The gate is:
   kill the nightly for one simulated day → an alert demonstrably fires.
2. **Timeout creep is visible before a kill night.** Any daily.yml job crossing
   85% of its `timeout-minutes` emits a `::warning` (line-start, bare print —
   the repo's annotation law) AND a row in a timings ledger. Gate: the ledger
   exists, has ≥1 night of rows, and a synthetic 86% run trips the warning.
3. **The M1 host has ≥100 GiB free and the theta store lives on the SSD**, per
   the ranked migration plan (snapshots → installer → git gc → per-tier
   symlinks). Gate: `df` screenshot + one clean `collect_tail` night after the
   move + `flow-ops-wt` git status clean.
4. **A cold-spare failover is a runbook, not an improvisation.** Gate: the
   spare-activation steps (label add/remove, what cannot fail over — theta-m1)
   are in `docs/`, and every timeout cap that assumes a warm cache states the
   cold-pace number (collect and engine now do; audit the rest).

## Part A — Never-again nightly

### A1 What actually broke (measured, Aug 2026 — three independent causes)

| Cause | Evidence | Blast radius |
|---|---|---|
| **engine timeout creep**: 200m cap, killed at ~205m two nights straight on two different hosts (mac-builder-5 then -1) | runs 31056495943, 31067383446 | no `commit engine outputs` → boards frozen Jul 31→Aug 6; Prophet pick gap |
| **GitHub Actions platform outage** (hosted runners not acquiring) | sweeper zero-step FAILUREs 17:15Z/18:41Z; main proof run queued 25m+; githubstatus: major_outage 18:46Z | PR proving, merging, pages deploy ALL dead at once — read as "total traffic jam"; 56 armed PRs stuck |
| **M1 disk: TM local snapshots pinning ~80 GiB** against an unreachable backup destination (+ theta store growth, + 29G git bloat in runner-1) | cache purge freed 8 MiB for 1.9 GB deleted; du-vs-df gap | ENOSPC hard-down 08-05; 28 GiB headroom = one bad night from repeat |

Secondary, real but non-fatal: CBOE options-chain whole-family session gaps
(worsening nightly), SEC CS_TERMS compile failure, tushare plane dark since
07-27 — the pipeline degraded to honest-null as designed (`engine` has
`if: always()`), and #4731 split collect's checkpoint so a capital-structure
failure cannot cost the night's market data.

Already shipped during the emergency: collect cap 185→240 under the cold-spare
law (#4731), engine cap 200→240 (#4741), cache purges, ranked SSD plan.

### A2 Workstreams (ranked by outage-hours prevented per unit effort)

**W1 — External freshness sentinel (the dead-man switch).** A cron on the VPS
(not GitHub) fetches the live pages' own bake stamps (`us_stocks.html`,
`china.html`, hub) and the R2 `massive_stock_day` publish time; if anything
exceeds its freshness budget (26h bake / per-plane budgets), it emails/pushes
the operator and writes a visible banner state the site itself can surface.
The 6-day gap happened because "red run in a channel nobody watches" is
indistinguishable from silence. Silence must become impossible: the check
lives on infrastructure that fails independently of GitHub. (The existing R2
freshness tripwire inside `engine` is the right idea in the wrong place — it
only fires when the nightly RUNS.)
**SHIPPED 2026-08-06:** `scripts/freshness_sentinel.py` +
`app/deploy/macro-sentinel.{service,timer}` (self-armed by `update.sh` on the
serving VPS, every 30 min, `Persistent=true`), state served at
`/live/staleness.json`. Budgets: 26h bakes (max observed healthy gap 23.2h over
60 days) + 4 calendar days on the us_stocks board's OWN delayed-board
disclosure (`prices as of` — rendered only when the engine reports the lag).
The board anchor matters: the Jul-31→Aug-6 outage re-baked the page every day
with fresh per-panel as-of annotations while the board froze, so neither
Last-Modified nor a page-wide as-of scrape can see that mode. china.html emits
no board stamp yet (its only `as of` is an FX widget) → bake-only until the
template grows one (follow-up chip filed). Alerts = Telegram + Discord + mailer
fan-out, 6h re-alert (immediate on a NEW surface joining; sticky through
blindness so a dark site never reads as recovery), blind escalation after ~3h,
alerts dispatched BEFORE state writes so a full disk cannot silence them.
Gate §0.1 pinned by
`tests/test_freshness_sentinel.py::test_simulated_dead_nightly_delivers_a_real_alert`
(real local webhook, no mocks on the transport path); the outage replay by
`test_jul31_outage_replay_breaches_on_the_board_marker`. Ops runbook:
`docs/VPS_LIVE_ORCHESTRATION.md` §Lanes.

**W2 — Runtime budget telemetry + 85% trend alarm.** Every cap raise in
daily.yml's history (70→120→150→200→240 engine; 40→120 tech_lab;
100→150→185→240 collect) followed dead nights, never preceded them. Add a
tiny per-band timing ledger (job start/end per named band, committed nightly or
pushed to R2) + a guard that `::warning`s at >85% of cap. Caps then get raised
from trend data BEFORE a kill night. This is ~30 lines of shell in the jobs +
one reader script. **SHIPPED 2026-08-06:** every self-hosted daily.yml job
carries a pre-checkout start mark + an `always()` finish step
(`scripts/ci/nightly_timings_finish.sh`) that appends per-band rows to
`data/ops/nightly_timings/<job>.jsonl` (per-job files — the append can never
race a sibling job's) and trips the line-start `::warning` above 85% of
`timeout-minutes`; band marks instrument collect/collect_tail/engine/tech_lab.
Reader: `scripts/nightly_timings_report.py`. Guard:
`tests/test_nightly_timings.py` (in the dag-conformance CI pack) pins the
wiring, pins each finish arg == the job's `timeout-minutes` so a cap raise
cannot silently rescale the tripwire, and drives the synthetic 86% run of gate
§0.2. Ledger seeded with the 2026-08-06 kill night — whose engine row reads
85.4% of even the NEW 240m cap, i.e. the tripwire fires on night one.

**W3 — Workload trims.** build_news GDELT de-rate first (~26–29m of 429
backoff inside the engine critical path even on green nights — cache/de-rate
or move into the parallel builders band, per the engine comment's own "next
lever"). Then re-measure; do not inherit step-cost labels (tech_lab law).

> **W3 RE-MEASURED 2026-08-06 — the ~26–29m label was itself stale** (the
> tech_lab law fired on this very workstream). That figure was measured on the

> to save ~5m. What W3 actually shipped: (1) the china_news wire query
> (410 chars) had been structurally rejected by GDELT every night since the
> ~06-20 length-limit tightening — a six-week-dark lane burning a doomed
> paced call nightly; it is now split into ≤230-char sub-queries
> (news_vector's probed limit) and live again. (2) daily.yml's stale cost
> labels corrected. **The band that is actually creeping is build_site:
> ~33m (07-21) → 35.7m (07-27) → 42.0m (08-03) → 61.7m/57.8m (08-05/08-06)**
> — +25m in two weeks, the largest step in the job and the real driver of the
> ~205m kill nights. Next W3 target: profile build_site's page loop.

**W3 re-measure (2026-08-06, from `##[group]` boundary timestamps in the engine
job logs — runs 30314534128 / 30862763261 / 31056495943 / 31067383446).** The
"build_news is the next lever" label was stale: measured, the creep is
**entirely inside build_site**, and every sibling band is flat.

| band | 07-27 | 08-03 | 08-05 | 08-06 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| regime engine (engine.run) | 1.6m | 1.1m | 1.4m | 1.3m |
| news suite (build_news) | 5.9m | 4.3m | 4.7m | 5.4m |
| **build_site** | **35.5m** | **41.6m** | **61.3m** | **57.4m** |
| build_track_record | 3.0m | 3.0m | 3.5m | 2.9m |
| MTF signals | 1.3m | 1.3m | 1.2m | 1.3m |

Intra-step attribution is impossible from CI logs (`run_py` buffers the whole
step to `$RUNNER_TEMP/step.log` and `cat`s it at the end, so per-line
timestamps all stamp at flush). A per-section checkpoint ledger now lives in
`scripts/build_site.py` (W2 for this step): 35 `_tmark()` sections, logged as
a sorted table each night + appended to `data/nightly_timings/build_site.jsonl`
(rides the engine job's `git add data/`). First instrumented run (local,
Studio, under nightly load — shares are the signal, absolutes inflate):
**stock_library 1248s (53%) + subsector_rotation 758s (32%) = 84% of the
build**; 32 of 35 sections total <4m together.

Root cause of the rotation pig (cProfile, 706s→27s fix verified): every
grader price lookup funnels through `engine/ai_desk.py::_close_series`, which
re-read parquet **uncached on every call** — `subsector_track_record.compute()`
grades all matured snapshot rows × 4 horizons × members × 2 endpoints =
268,564 loader calls / 413,053 `read_parquet` attempts per night, growing
~250 ledger rows/night since mid-July. That unbounded-in-ledger-size scan is
the gradual +25m creep; `radar_ic.py` had already memoized the same loader
locally in 06-2026 (`_SERIES_MEMO`) — the fix hoists the memo into
`_close_series` itself so every desk grader gets it. stock_library's own
attribution + trim is the follow-on lane (profiled serially; washout-turn
(#4657) and the per-name loop are the candidates).

**W3 PRODUCTION-VERIFIED 2026-08-08 (#4848 merged 08-07 08:20Z).** The trim's
PR body carried local cProfile numbers only; these are the nightly's own rows
from `data/nightly_timings/build_site.jsonl`, i.e. the ledger the same PR
shipped grading its own fix:

| build_site | 08-05 | 08-06 | → | 08-07 23:03Z | 08-08 07:01Z | 08-08 15:34Z |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **TOTAL** | **61.3m** | **57.4m** | | **23.9m** | **24.9m** | **22.6m** |
| `subsector_rotation` | (12.6m local) | | | 0.2m | 0.2m | 0.2m |
| `stock_library` | (20.8m local) | | | 19.9m | 21.1m | 15.9m |

The step now runs at **~38% of its 08-05 cost**, and the engine job that
carried it concluded **126.1m success** (run 31254922905, 08-08 14:24→16:30Z)
against the ~205m hard-cancels of 08-05/08-06. Attribute carefully — the job
total is NOT one lane's win: #4986 (merged 08-08 11:49Z) moved the Filing
Forensics SEC spine off the render path in the same window. What is directly
attributable to #4848 is the `subsector_rotation` section, which the ledger
now records at **0.2m/night** against the 12.6m the first instrumented
(pre-fix) run measured on the same host — the sign and size the 706s → 27s
cProfile before/after predicted. Cross-environment caveat: 12.6m is a local
capture and 0.2m is production, so treat the section's own before/after as
the cProfile pair; the ledger rows confirm the fix held in production.

**Re-measure caution — a trim that was already delivered by somebody else
(tech_lab law, second firing).** `stock_library` is now 70–88% of the step and
the obvious next target. The 08-06/08-07 serial profile of it found a clear #1
hotspot: `confluence_tiers._tf_bars` ran
`resample().apply(lambda x: x.dropna().index.max())`, a pure-Python groupby
(`_aggregate_series_pure_python`, 13.6M lambda calls, ~1600s of a 3400s
capture). That code **no longer exists on main**. PR #4732 (`2a0c5e27184`,
merged 2026-08-07 07:11Z) rewrote `_tf_bars` as one vectorized groupby over
absolute session-calendar bucket ids — for CORRECTNESS, not speed (bin edges
had been anchored to the series' FIRST timestamp, flipping the tier on 13/232
names; `research/SESSION_ANCHOR_ABSOLUTE_CALENDAR_ADJUDICATION_BY_FABLE.md`
R1–R3) — and deleted the Python-level apply from the hot path as a side
effect. A correctness lane silently collected the perf win, and a profile
captured on a base one commit older would have sent this workstream to
re-optimise code that was already gone.

Two consequences, both load-bearing: (1) the three ledger rows above ALL
postdate #4732, so 15.9–21.1m is what stock_library costs *after* that fix —
the 21.1m → 15.9m spread between the 08-08 07:01Z and 15:34Z runs is
**unattributed run-to-run variance** (differing host load / cache warmth on a
shared builder), NOT a landed trim, and must not be read as one. (2) The only
survivor of that `resample().apply` pattern is
`engine/entry_primitives.py:796`. Any further stock_library trim must be
profiled against CURRENT main; the 08-06 capture is void.

**W4 — Disk program on the M1.** Execute the ranked plan (operator sudo
required for ranks 0/3): TM snapshots ~80G → `tmutil disable` decision →
macOS Install Data 12G → `git gc` runner-1's 29G `.git` → theta store 60G to
`/Volumes/STORAGE` via per-tier symlinks (no repo PR needed — the resolver
follows symlinks). Explicitly REJECTED: relocating runner `_work` to the SSD
(case-sensitive HFS+ under a git checkout; USB unmount kills all jobs; only
~28G marginal after the gc). Ratify the Worktree GC (#4563) on the Studio —
the disarmed guard is a slow outage, already proven once at 223 worktrees.

**W5 — Runner fleet redundancy.** The label failover WORKED (mac-builder-5
took collect cold). Codify it: spare-activation runbook; keep `macstudio` on
one Studio spare permanently (operator choice 2026-08-05, make it standing);
the only non-failoverable job is `collect_tail` (theta store is M1-local —
after W4 the store is on a portable SSD, which *creates* the option of
re-homing it if the M1 dies). Cloud/VPS runners: NOT for the mac-bound engine
band (data locality, cost); OPTIONAL as a burst lane for Linux-tolerant jobs —
but note the 2026-08-06 lesson cuts the other way: our self-hosted fleet was
the thing that KEPT working while GitHub's own hosted pool died. The
resilience buy is a second *alerting* path, not a second compute pool.

**W6 — Data-source forensics lane. EXECUTED 2026-08-06 — see §A4 for findings.**
CBOE whole-family gaps (backfill + root-cause the growing session misses), SEC
CS_TERMS, tushare token (#4676). These are display-tier data outages — they never
block the build (epistemics law) but each one quietly narrows confluence inputs
([[dead-shared-input-caps-the-confluence-count]] class). Outcome: two of the three
were NOT the collector's fault (nightly commit-loss; a vendor credential), and
the growing CBOE list was two causes wearing one symptom.

### A3 Explicit non-goals for Part A

No nightly rewrite, no orchestrator swap, no new CI system. The nightly's
problem was budgets, disk, and observability — not its existence. Part B owns
its gradual dissolution.

## Part B — The breathing dashboard (trajectory, extending the ratified plan)

### B1 What is already ratified (unchanged)

The 07-29 masterplan rules: hybrid product — committed HTML shell + always-on
live data plane + browser hydrators on high-change islands + same-origin
API/SSE as the stable contract; canonical vintages/scores/ledgers stay
single-writer nightly. A SPA rewrite is explicitly not the remedy. This doc
does not reopen any of that.

### B2 The trajectory ruling (what "supersede the nightly" actually means)

The end-state is NOT "the nightly, but every 5 minutes." It is a **cadence
split along the authority boundary** the repo already enforces:

- **Display tier → continuous.** Every fact whose useful life is minutes
  (quotes, breadth, flow, live signal *readings*) migrates island-by-island
  onto the VPS live plane per the ratified architecture. Each island that
  migrates is REMOVED from the render path, so the nightly's engine band
  shrinks monotonically — the creep that killed Aug 2–6 reverses
  structurally instead of being re-budgeted forever.
- **Authority tier → stays batch, gets small.** Forward-ledger advancement,
  grading, calibration, vintages, promotion gates remain a nightly
  single-writer checkpoint (epistemics law). Freed of page rendering and news
  sweeps, that job trends toward a <60m data-and-ledgers run that fits any
  runner, cold or warm.
- **The site becomes reader, not artifact.** Pages progressively read the
  JSON/SSE plane; the committed-HTML shell remains the resilience floor
  (VPS 3-min pull), exactly as ratified. When GitHub is down, the shell
  serves; when the VPS plane is down, the shell's last bake + honest
  staleness banners serve (W1's sentinel state doubles as the banner input).

### B3 Migration waves

- **W0 (now):** Part A hardening. Prerequisite for everything — a live system
  built on an unobserved substrate inherits the blindness.
- **W-B1:** finish the ratified Phase 1 islands; every migrated island deletes
  its render-path twin (measured engine-minutes reclaimed per island — report
  in the PR body).
- **W-B2:** collectors decompose from the 1×3h `collect` monolith into
  per-source jobs on their own cadences (5–60 min, idempotent, R2-versioned).
  `config/dag.yml` is already the dependency spine — the change is trigger
  granularity, not topology.
- **W-B3:** signal services — the incremental recompute path for display-tier
  signals on data arrival (VPS or a small dedicated compute box), publishing
  to the same plane contract. The nightly re-derives the same signals as the
  authority checkpoint; divergence between the two is itself a monitored
  signal (free integrity check).
- **W-B4:** nightly is now grading + vintages + heavy backfills only. Retire
  the 240m caps; the cold-spare law becomes trivial to satisfy.

### B4 Infrastructure posture

Current fleet (M1 + Studio + 4 Linux render boxes + VPS + R2) is sufficient
through W-B2 once W4 lands. Decision points, deferred until measured need:
one dedicated compute VPS for signal services at W-B3 (sized after W-B2 tells
us the per-cadence compute cost); real-time quote upgrade per the Polygon
websocket seam doc. GitHub plan upgrades buy nothing for the failure modes we
actually had (public repo = free hosted minutes; the outage was GitHub's, not
a quota).

### A4 W6 findings (executed 2026-08-06 — all three sources root-caused)

The W6 lane was commissioned as "three display-tier outages"; it found **three
different failure classes**, only one of which was the collector's own fault.

**(1) CBOE delayed-chain family — TWO causes, not one.** The growing
missing-session list (2 sessions on 08-04 → 4 by 08-06) read like one worsening
collector defect. It was two:

| session | cause | recoverable |
|---|---|---|
| 07-30 | CBOE CDN 429'd ≥3 min (run 30590845976, 23:42–23:45Z+) — outlasted the 3/6/12s ladder AND the 60s cooldown that was sized for the ~1-min 07-27 flap | gex_SPY/QQQ/IWM only, from the polygon archive |
| 07-31 | same 429 shape later in the sweep — gex_META/gex_MSFT 429'd through the cooldown too (run 30673008620, 23:40:15Z first fail → 23:41:35Z post-cooldown fail) | no |
| 08-03 | `NYGamingAdapter` duck-typing crash (run 30862763261) → step exit 1 → the night's single checkpoint never committed | no |
| 08-04 | capital-structure `ManifestIdentityError` (run 30960328285) → same commit loss | no |
| 08-05 | CS document-terms exit 2 degraded (run 31056495943) → same commit loss | no |

The last three are **not CBOE failures at all** — the rows were fetched and then
discarded unwritten. This is the [[skipped-commit-deletes-live-snapshot-stores]]
class: an unrelated step's non-zero exit silently deletes every store the night
touched. #4534/#4600/#4640 fixed the three individual crashers and **#4731 closed
the class** by splitting the checkpoint so market data commits before the CS
chain. The remaining collector-owned defect is the retry ladder, now escalated to
60s→300s.

**Backfill discovery worth its own law:** `data/polygon_gex/` carries the same
16-column schema from the same `engine.gex_engine.compute_gex`, so a lost cboe
`gex_<name>` session *can* be honestly cross-filled — but the store is stamped
`datetime.now(UTC).date()` at accrual, and the evening band runs past 00:00Z, so
**every polygon row is stamped session+1** (verified: stamp 07-31 spot 741.69 ==
yahoo SPY close of session 07-30). The same shift makes the `is_session` gate
refuse every Friday-evening accrual outright. An unverified copy would have
landed the WRONG session into an authority-adjacent store; the backfill script
therefore hard-asserts spot-vs-yahoo before writing. Fixing the stamping (and
migrating the young store) is chipped separately. SPX has no archive anywhere, so
putcall/gex/gex_SPX stay permanently lost for all five sessions — registered in
`KNOWN_PERMANENT_GAPS`, never fabricated.

> **SUPERSEDED 2026-08-07 (#4807) — do not apply the `session+1` rule above to a
> cross-fill today.** The chip landed: `build_polygon_gex` now stamps the session a
> snapshot describes, so rows written after it carry that session with **no shift**.
> Its migration re-stamped the raw `chains/` files but **not** the chain-family
> underlyings' summaries (SPY/QQQ/IWM/NVDA/AAPL/TSLA/AMD/META/MSFT), so those files
> now hold **both** eras. Measured on all nine 2026-08-07: stamps ≤ 07-31 match the
> PRIOR session's close to 0.000%, the 08-07 stamp matches its OWN session to 0.000%,
> and the 08-06 stamp matches no session at all (a pre-market tape). The offset is
> era-dependent — pin the session on the spot-vs-yahoo identity check, never on the
> stamp. The paragraph above stands as the 2026-08-06 forensic record only.

**(2) SEC CS_TERMS — forensics only; the two nights failed DIFFERENTLY.** Treating
"CS_TERMS failed" as one recurring fault would have mis-fixed it. 08-05 (run
31056495943) exited **2, `status: degraded`**, mass `SEC complete-submission must
contain exactly 1 canonical SEC-HEADER opener line(s)` — the grammar class #4640
fixed. 08-06 (run 31067383446) exited **1** from
`_validate_observation_lineage` → `validate_manifest_retained_bytes_binding`:
`ManifestIdentityError: retained source bytes are required`. The lineage pass
decided a row was exempt from byte-reading (`needs_source_bytes` heuristic: only
rows with a child document or a sub-document span), but the sealed binder added
by #4319 re-derives manifest identity from the submission envelope *before* it
looks at any span, so it requires the bytes unconditionally — and the four
deferral branches emit exactly the root-span-only rows the heuristic exempted.
A caller's model of a validator's contract drifted from the validator. Already
owned by open PR #4740 (rebased onto healed main during this lane); no second
lane opened.

**(3) Tushare — not a repo defect at all.** Every call returns vendor
**`code=40101 msg=您的token不对，请确认。`** (verified, asia run 31095457182:
trade_cal, daily, daily_basic, moneyflow_dc). The GitHub secret exists; the
vendor rejects its **value**. Prior diagnosis (#4676: denied plan / exhausted
积分) is superseded. The plane has been dark 10 days while `run_status` read
`ok`, because each module cleanly returned 0 rows and the adapter still wrote its
heartbeat — [[heartbeat-only-adapter-is-invisible-to-freshness-guards]] in its
purest form. W6 makes it visible (`last_auth_error()` + a raise + a line-start
`::error`); **restoring it is an operator action**: reissue the token at
tushare.pro and update the `TUSHARE_TOKEN` secret.

**Cross-cutting lesson for the W1 sentinel:** all three outages were invisible to
`run_status` for days-to-weeks, and two of them (the commit-loss nights, the
tushare heartbeat) reported **`status: ok`** while producing nothing. A sentinel
that reads adapter status will not see this class; it must read **store
membership against the exchange calendar**, which is what
`check_chain_session_coverage` already does for one family and what the tushare
`run_log` all-zeros row would have shown on day one.

### B5 Falsifiers / kill criteria

- If W1's sentinel produces >2 false-positive pages in a month, the freshness
  budgets are wrong — fix budgets, don't mute the sentinel.
- If an island migration does NOT reduce engine minutes (twin not deleted),
