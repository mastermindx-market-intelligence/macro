# Massive Advanced Integration — umbrella masterplan for the tick plane, the flow desks, and the Terminal bridge

_Authored by Fable, 2026-08-08, on operator commission ("research what new data we can
implement… advanced strategies… across macro dashboard and terminal and options intraday
flow in Terminal — create extensive build plan"). Status: **PLAN OF RECORD, waves gated
individually** — TP-0 ships with this PR; every later wave is a normal ship-loop PR (or a
charting-app PR for §6) commissioned per §5's inline prompts. Grounded in: a live
entitlement probe run today (§1), the four-lane census run for this doc (repo estate,
Terminal estate, collision registry, vendor matrix), and the anchor docs cited throughout.
Companion docs: `research/BREATHING_PLATFORM_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md` §7½ (M-waves — a
SIBLING program, not subsumed), `research/LIVE_FLOW_PRODUCTION_ROADMAP_BY_FABLE.md`
(P-phases; this plan executes its deferred rungs), `research/DARKPOOL_DESK_AUDIT_AND_UPGRADE_2026-08-05.md`
(the desk this plan gives eyes to), `research/OPTIONS_FLOW_DATA.md`, `research/LIVE_DATA_POLYGON.md` §3._

## §0 ACCEPTANCE GATES (per wave, "not done unless")

Inline per the spawn-handoff law — a pointer to this section goes in every commissioning
prompt, and the wave's PR body must show the evidence.

**TP-0 (this PR) — verified ruler:**
1. `scripts/massive_entitlement_probe.py` + tests merged; probe run against the live key;
   `data/massive/capability_manifest.json` committed with `derived{}` verdicts populated
   (not `null`) for realtime trades, realtime quotes, second aggs, tick-history depth,
   options tier, indices tier.
2. The manifest never contains key material (self-check in the probe, pinned by a test
   that plants a fake key in a raised exception and asserts it cannot reach the output).
3. This masterplan merged with every DNR row it must honor cited by stable key (§2.4).

**TP-0.5 (concurrency + depth re-probe; small, BEFORE TP-1 design freezes):**
1. WS concurrency probe run during RTH: hold the real-time stocks socket open, then
   attempt the delayed socket (and the reverse), recording whether both survive — this
   decides whether delayed/real-time share one connection bucket (§3.1b's premise; the
   TP-0 Saturday run cannot decide it, see §1 footnote). Also read the Terminal hub's
   effective cluster (`/health`) before/after.
2. RTH re-probe of `ws_stocks_realtime` with data frames observed (TP-0's Saturday
   verdict rests on auth+subscribe only).
3. Quote-history depth rungs (`v3/quotes` at 2015/2005) + S3 flat-file LIST probes
   (`trades_v1`, `quotes_v1` prefixes) added to the probe + manifest — TP-B's quotes
   branch is unsatisfiable until the manifest actually carries these verdicts.
4. Probe's business-day fallback switched to `/v1/marketstatus/upcoming` (entitled)
   with the hardcoded holiday table demoted to offline fallback.

**TP-1 (ingest spine) — not done unless:**
1. A supervised WS client holds `T.*` + `Q.*` subscriptions for the pilot universe
   through a full RTH session with ≥ 99% session-seconds connected — early-close
   sessions (13:00 ET) and DST transitions handled via the market-status calendar,
   never wall-clock arithmetic. Reconnect gaps healed via REST replay; healed trades
   are signed only against replayed `v3/quotes` for the same gap, else hard-labeled
   `unclassified` (a cold NBBO ring must never sign silently); replay/live dedup key
   pinned as `(ticker, id, sip_timestamp)`; heal receipts logged as structured JSONL.
2. In-flight NBBO join measured and printed in the PR body **stratified by venue
   class**: lit prints ≥ 95% classified against a quote ≤ 5s old; off-exchange
   (TRF-reported) prints measured and disclosed separately with NO floor at TP-1 —
   their floor is set at TP-2 from this measurement (late reporting makes their
   quote-age distribution structurally different; hiding them inside a blended gate
   would fake precision). Remainder labeled `unclassified`, never guessed.
3. Off-exchange (`exchange == 4`) prints carry `trf_id` through to the minute rollup;
   lit vs off-exchange totals reconcile against the day's grouped-daily volume within
   2% on ≥ 90% of pilot names, with session scope stated (RTH vs incl-extended) and
   halted names carved out to their own disclosed bucket (no NBBO during a halt;
   reopen prints excluded from the ≤5s gate, counted in volume per condition rules).
4. Every artifact lands in a **dedicated PRIVATE R2 bucket with its own credential
   family** — the existing `publish_r2.py`/`audit_r2.py` pipeline serves the PUBLIC
   bucket (`audit_r2.py` literally alarms when an object is not publicly readable), so
   TP-1's first deliverable is the private plane: bucket + creds + a credentialed
   (S3 HEAD) beacon mode + freshness assertion on CONTENT advancing. **Zero tick/quote
   payloads in the public bucket or the public repo, ever.** Producer registers in the
   data-health breaker (`run_status.json` + audit tripwire) so a silent death surfaces
   within one session (the 21-night `massive_stock_day` no-creds incident is the
   binding precedent).
5. Kill switch: one config flag stops the daemon and the site falls back to the current
   (M1) REST presentation with no dead panels.

**TP-2 (off-exchange intraday desk) — not done unless:**
1. `darkpool.html` gains its intraday tier fed from R2 rollups: real per-print block tape
   (≥ $100k/$500k/$1m tiers), off-exchange share vs 20-day baseline (median/MAD z, current
   observation excluded — reuse `engine/darkpool_signals.trailing_z`), and price-level
   shelves — all labeled "off-exchange" per R5 semantics; the words "dark pool" appear
   only where ATS attribution genuinely exists (FINRA weekly tier).
2. Signed inference (NBBO quote-rule) ships **display-tier** with its measured
   classification rate on the card; no rank/size/gate authority; `is_context_only=true`.
3. Forward ledger rows accrue nightly from the intraday observations via the nightly lane
   only (the intraday lane never advances a forward ledger — epistemics law).
4. Bilingual EN/ZH; glance tier passes the banned-vocab sweep; hover carries the receipt
   (venue nuance: TRF ≠ named ATS; attribution stays weekly-FINRA).
5. The nightly rollup step fits the measured budget: ≤ 5 min added to `collect_tail` or
   an offrender sibling (never the render path), timings-ledger entry present.

**TP-3 (block/institutional signal factory) — not done unless:** every new signal
artifact registers in `config/synapse.yml` with grade + lobe, ships display-tier with
nulls printed, and any promotion beyond display carries its own pre-registered gate doc
(§4.4) — "not found yet" outcomes print as nulls, never blocked from shipping.

**TP-4 (Prophet/engine confluence) — not done unless:** confluence inputs land behind
Prophet's existing input contracts as **nullable columns** with coverage floors declared
(the `nullable-input-to-a-cross-sectional-gate-needs-a-coverage-floor` law); zero
published-threshold recomputes without a pre-registered era note (M3's era law binds here
too); ledger columns single-writer (A9).

**TP-5 (Terminal bridge) — not done unless:** Terminal surfaces render from the same R2
artifacts the dashboard reads (one producer, two faces); tier-gating enforced
server-side; i18n complete across the Terminal lexicons; no vendor names user-facing
(debrand law); the D4 deferral lift is recorded (operator ask 2026-08-08) in the PR body.

**TP-6 (event microstructure) — not done unless:** every event-study artifact carries its
timestamp provenance (`participant_timestamp` vs `sip_timestamp` choice stated); headline
join uses the wire's ingest stamp with measured wire latency disclosed; any "informed
flow" style tripwire ships as a watch condition, never a verdict (2026-07-27 falsifier
language law).

**Global, all waves:** normal ship loop (commit → push → PR → CI → same-day squash-merge
→ live verification); new guards registered in `config/house_law_checks.yml`; new
producers in the freshness breaker; GH annotations only as line-start `print(..., flush=True)`.

**Global licensing gate (B3) — CLOSED 2026-08-09. Every user-facing wave is
unblocked.** An Enterprise Market Data License and Redistribution Addendum
(effective 2026-08-09) grants full display, non-display, redistribution, AI/ML,
white-label and export rights across the enterprise stock-data scope, and the
operator has confirmed full licensing and distribution rights. The record is
`research/licenses/MASSIVE_ENTITLEMENT_RECORD.md`; **the executed instrument is
held privately and is deliberately not committed — this repo is PUBLIC and the
agreement is mutually confidential.**

TP-2…TP-6 surfaces no longer ship internal-first on licensing grounds. The Terminal
hub README's note ("live cluster requires an RT-entitled plan + signed exchange
agreements") is satisfied at the plan level; per-dataset provider conditions (e.g.
an exchange entitlement for raw NBBO redistribution) are identified by the vendor in
writing and remain the authority for that specific feed. The debrand law is
unchanged — the vendor is never named on a public product surface, and licensing
grants no signal authority: promotion to rank/size/gate still runs the gauntlet.

## §1 What the upgrade actually grants (verified, not marketing)

Two independent verifications, same day:

1. **Breathing Platform §7½ live check (2026-08-08 ~06:50Z):** `v3/trades` + `v3/quotes`
   403→200; second aggs, snapshot, financials, splits all 200; S3 flat files
   `us_stocks_sip/day_aggs_v1` back to 2006-03-15, `minute_aggs_v1` to ≥ 2010-06-15;
   trades tape current through prior session's 20:00 ET close. Plan sold as: real-time,
   unlimited calls, trades+quotes, second+minute aggs, 20y+ flat files, websockets,
   snapshot, reference, corporate actions, financials, business licensing included.
   **RESOLVED 2026-08-09:** the licensing clause was a purchase-record claim when this
   was written — no probe can establish display/redistribution rights. It is now
   backed by an executed Enterprise Market Data License and Redistribution Addendum
   and an operator confirmation of full licensing and distribution rights; the §0 gate
   is CLOSED and the record is `research/licenses/MASSIVE_ENTITLEMENT_RECORD.md`.
   The distinction the original wording drew still stands as doctrine: an entitlement
   PROBE answers "does the key return data", never "may we show or redistribute it".
2. **TP-0 probe manifest (`data/massive/capability_manifest.json`, committed with this
   PR):** re-runnable (`scripts/massive_entitlement_probe.py`), 36 test functions (59
   parametrized cases), key-scrubbed (leak self-check runs before every write). Run
   2026-08-08T11:44Z, 33s, market closed — WS verdicts rest on auth+subscribe only
   (zero data frames expected on a Saturday; TP-0.5 re-proves during RTH):

   | Capability | Verdict | Evidence |
   |---|---|---|
   | Real-time trades (REST `v2/last/trade`) | **entitled** | 200, ts 23:59:59Z prior session |
   | Real-time NBBO (REST `v2/last/nbbo`) | **entitled** | 200, bid+ask present |
   | WS stocks real-time `T.*`+`Q.*` | **entitled** | auth_success + subscribe success |
   | Second aggregates | **entitled** | 50 bars returned |
   | Tick history depth | **20y+** | `v3/trades` non-empty at 2015 AND 2005 probes |
   | Quote **recency** (`v3/quotes`, no depth rung probed) | entitled | 200 — historical NBBO depth + flat-file `quotes_v1` entitlement are UNPROBED until TP-0.5; nothing downstream may assume them |
   | Snapshots (single/gainers/unified) + grouped daily | entitled | 200 × 4 |
   | Reference/conditions/splits/dividends/financials | entitled | 200 (94 conditions; 27 stocks venues) |
   | **Short interest + short volume REST** (`/stocks/v1/*`) | entitled | 200 — new since the old integration |
   | Treasury yields | entitled | 200 |
   | Options chain snapshot (greeks/IV/OI) | entitled | 200, greeks present |
   | **Options trades / options WS / options realtime** | **not_entitled** | 403 + subscribe error + no `last_quote`/`last_trade` in snapshot (3 signals triangulate) |
   | Indices (`v3/snapshot/indices`, WS) | **not_entitled** | 403 + auth_failed |
   | Benzinga endpoints | not_entitled | 403 (paid add-ons) |
   | WS stocks **delayed** cluster | ambiguous | auth_success then close **1008 (max_connections)** — cause UNDECIDABLE from this run: the probe's own just-closed real-time socket (close_timeout 2s vs 1.5s settle) explains it as well as the Terminal hub holding the slot; a Saturday hub may hold nothing. TP-0.5's concurrency probe decides it |
   | `plan_guess` | `stocks: advanced_or_higher; options: snapshot-tier; indices: none` | derived block, committed |

   Naming nuance recorded by the probe: the exchanges reference labels **id 4 "FINRA
   Alternative Display Facility"** — the vendor's own scanner tutorial nonetheless
   defines off-exchange prints as `exchange==4 && trf_id present` (ADF + TRFs report
   through the same id namespace slot). TP-1 validates empirically on live prints
   (distribution of `exchange` ids where `trf_id` is present) before any copy names a
   facility; `trf_id` 201/202/203 remains the TRF-pipe map.

What this **does not** change (probed, §7½-consistent, and load-bearing for scope):
- **Options entitlements are a separate product.** As of the 2026-06-21 probe
  (`research/OPTIONS_FLOW_DATA.md`): options snapshot (OI/IV/greeks) + flat-file
  minute/day aggs entitled; OPRA per-trade tape and options NBBO **not** entitled. The
  TP-0 manifest re-probes this — if the bundle changed, §7 re-scopes by amendment.
  Until then: the options *tape* vendor remains ThetaData (signing calibration ratified
  #1292); Massive Advanced contributes the **equity leg** (real-time spot for greeks,
  NBBO for the underlying, second bars) to the options stack.
- **Indices/futures/fx/crypto real-time**: not part of Stocks Advanced (indices cluster
  probe recorded in the manifest; expected not-entitled).

### §1.1 Vendor facts that bind the architecture (docs-sourced, 2026-08-08)

- **ONE simultaneous WebSocket connection per cluster per product** on individual
  plans (extras $75/mo via support). This is the single most architecture-shaping
  constraint — see §3.1b connection-ownership law. Delayed and real-time hosts are
  separate endpoints (`delayed.polygon.io` vs `socket.polygon.io`).
- Stocks Advanced tier ladder: `T.*` real-time from Advanced (Developer = delayed);
  **`Q.*` NBBO exists at Advanced only** (no delayed tier below it); `A.*` second aggs
  + `AM.*` minute aggs; **`LULD.*` is Advanced-only** (halt/band monitor is genuinely
  new); **`FMV.*` is Business-tier only — we do NOT have it; never design against it.**
- REST: `v3/trades` + `v2/last/trade` (Developer+), `v3/quotes` + `v2/last/nbbo`
  (Advanced-only), full-market + unified snapshots, grouped daily, second-level custom
  bars. Unlimited calls with a documented soft ceiling (~<100 req/s recommended);
  M2's politeness law binds regardless.
- **Flat Files (S3)** on all paid tiers: daily gzip CSVs for trades / quotes (top-of-book
  NBBO) / minute / day aggs, nanosecond stamps, TRF prints included; prior-day file
  ready ~11:00 ET — flat files are a T+1 substrate, never a live one. **Depth + size
  verified by LIST 2026-08-08 (our creds):** `trades_v1` from 2005-06 (64MB/day gz
  then → ~1.6GB/day gz 2024); `quotes_v1` from 2005-06 (160MB/day gz then →
  **~4.8GB/day gz 2024** — market-wide daily files, so a blanket multi-year quote
  backfill is TB-scale; TP-B's quote strategy is therefore episode-windowed files +
  per-name REST `v3/quotes` (proven 20y deep) for targeted windows, never a bulk
  crawl).
- **Condition codes carry machine-readable `update_rules`** (`updates_volume`,
  `updates_high_low`, `updates_open_close`) via `/v3/reference/conditions` — all
  bar/VWAP math branches on those booleans, never on hardcoded condition IDs.
- **Off-exchange identification (official tutorial method):** `exchange == 4` AND
  `trf_id` present ⇒ TRF-reported print; `trf_id` 201 = FINRA/NYSE TRF,
  202 = FINRA/Nasdaq TRF Carteret, 203 = FINRA/Nasdaq TRF Chicago. Tutorial default
  block floor $100k notional. The tutorial omits the attribution caveat — house law
  keeps it: **TRF ≠ named ATS**; venue naming stays with FINRA weekly (§2.1).
- **Short Interest (`/stocks/v1/short-interest`, biweekly) and Short Volume
  (`/stocks/v1/short-volume`, daily, venue + exempt split, history from 2024-02)** are
  included on all stocks tiers — a free cross-check for the FINRA CNMSshvol collector,
  not a replacement (FINRA history is deeper and already sealed/attested).
- Benzinga endpoints are $99/mo-per-dataset add-ons — **not** included; do not plan
  around them. Financials vX is sunset (June 2026) in favor of the Fundamentals
  family — M5's concern, noted so the probe's `financials` verdict is read correctly.
- Rebrand mechanics: PyPI package is now `massive` (v2.8.x; `polygon-api-client`
  frozen at 1.16.3, critical-fixes only); hosts `api.massive.com` /
  `socket.massive.com` canonical with `*.polygon.io` still honored "for an extended
  period". New code takes the host from config (`config.yml polygon.base_url`), adds
  the massive.com hosts as the documented default at TP-1, and never hardcodes either.

## §2 Program boundaries — who owns what (collision map)

This is an umbrella plan in a crowded estate. The census found the estate **prepared**
for this purchase — three documents pre-registered seams that were waiting for the
entitlement. This plan activates those seams and builds only what nobody owns.

### §2.1 Owned elsewhere — cited, not rebuilt

| Lane | Owner | This plan's relationship |
|---|---|---|
| **M1 real-time honesty flip** (`delayed_min 15→0`, ~19 label sites, `verify_massive_realtime.py`) | Breathing Platform §7½ | Prerequisite for user-facing "live" copy anywhere; TP waves consume its verdict, never flip labels themselves |
| **M2 rate-guard re-tunes** (workers 5→measured, pacing, `max_underlyings`) | BP §7½ | TP-1's daemon obeys the same politeness law; measured raises only |
| **M3 daily/minute-agg history extension** (`EARLIEST_ENTITLED` → 2006) | BP §7½ | TP-2's baselines read the extended store when it lands; era law respected |
| **M4 equity-tape adoption for flow signing** (`engine/flow_signing.py` tick-rule → quote-rule via REST/flat-file `quotes_v1`; retire databento; LSR reopener via fresh prereg) | BP §7½ | TP-1's **live** NBBO join is the streaming sibling of M4's historical join — same classification code, one home (§3.4); the LSR reopener prereg stays M4's |
| **M5 reference/corp-actions/financials collectors** | BP §7½ | TP stores join splits/divs from M5's spine (the F6 split trap lives here) |
| Provisional close-pass, breathing board, CN same-day (W-L1…W-L4) | BP core waves | TP artifacts may feed its badges later; no shared files |
| Fear/greed, screener, EOD flow desk phases P1–P5 | `LIVE_FLOW_PRODUCTION_ROADMAP` | Untouched; TP-2/TP-3 fulfill its **T3e/T4e** dark-pool rungs ("massive trades_v1 upgrade… paid SIP/live tape") that were procurement-deferred |
| FINRA weekly ATS/non-ATS attribution, venue roles, PSS-AF1 compliance | Dark-pool desk v2 (shipped 08-05) | TP-2 adds the desk's own §3-declared missing tier (intraday/per-print); weekly attribution remains the venue-truth layer |
| Options EOD tape, signing calibration, T2a signed features | Roadmap P2 (ThetaData; `HOLD-THETA-TAPE` suspends the Final3-lobes tape lobe specifically) | Unchanged vendor; TP-7 only upgrades *cadence* and the equity leg |
| **`/ws/tape` browser fanout + futures tape + live breadth scoreboard** | `LIVE_TAPE_SCOREBOARD_MASTERPLAN` (CHARTERED 07-24; built `app/tape.py`, Yahoo-sourced). Its **D2** assigned any future Polygon WS to slot behind its relay; its **D6** chartered breadth as snapshot-join, NOT per-name WS | Honest tension, named: TP-1 stands up a vendor socket for **artifact production** (a scope D2 did not adjudicate — D2 governs the browser quote path, whose consumers stay unchanged). §4.2/8 (WS-derived breadth) is an amendment PROPOSAL to their D6, not an offer; their charter decides. Any conflict at build time resolves by amendment to one doc or the other, never silently |
| Heartbeat/staleness spine (CSP-W5/W6 `run_status.json`, breakers) | Contagion-sensing program | TP producers REGISTER in it (mandatory), never fork it |
| Intel Hub lobe audit (W0–W6) | `INTEL_HUB_LOBE_AUDIT…` (08-08) | Parallel program, no shared files; new synapse artifacts follow its ruler conventions |
| Terminal options-hub UX, flow desk, GEX desk, voltick port | `OPTIONS_HUB_MASTERPLAN`, `VOLTICK_COMPETITIVE_SWEEP_AND_BUILD_PLAN`, `INTRADAY_FLOW_TRACKER_DESIGN`(+V2 ruling) | TP-5 lands *data planes + overlays* into their surfaces; UX programs keep their charters |

### §2.2 This plan owns (net-new)

1. **The tick plane** — supervised Massive WS ingest (trades + NBBO), in-flight
   classification, minute/second rollups, R2 tick-artifact layout, gap heal, health.
2. **Off-exchange intraday** — real TRF prints: blocks, DP share intraday, shelves,
   signed inference (display-tier), after-hours block monitor.
3. **Tick history plane** — flat-file trades/quotes backfill (scoped universe), baseline
   calibration for every intraday z-score, and the backtest substrate for promotions.
4. **Event microstructure** — press-wire/earnings-wire × nanosecond tape joins.
5. **Second-aggregate structures** — opening-range/acceleration features offered to BP's
   breathing lane and Prophet anticipation (consumers decide; display first).
6. **Terminal bridge** — the D4 lift: flow/desk surfaces in charting-app fed by this
   repo's R2 artifacts (one producer, two faces).
7. **Options cadence upgrade** — intraday snapshot cadence for GEX/flow context using
   already-entitled endpoints + live equity spot (no new OPRA claims).

### §2.3 Explicit non-goals

- No second quotes pipeline: `live_quotes.py`/worker/`live.js` presentation is M1's.
- No options-tape vendor change; no OPRA claims beyond probed entitlements.
- No indices/futures/fx feeds (not entitled; probe-recorded).
- No yfinance replacement program (separate risk decision; `massive_stock_day` already
  covers whole-market daily cross-sections).
- No LLM-originated signals anywhere in the plane (A7; LLMs may only de-escalate
  calibrated keys).

### §2.4 Standing kills/laws/holds honored (stable keys, quoted scope)

| Key | What it forbids/holds here | TP consequence |
|---|---|---|
| `DNR:KILL-LIQUIDITY-SHOCK-REVERSAL-CLASSIFIER` | LSR-P0 killed; STILL-OPEN clause names tape-grade features (signed order imbalance, price-impact-per-signed-dollar, true spread) as "blocked on entitlement, not effort" | The reopener is **M4's** to exercise via fresh prereg; TP waves build the substrate but never resurrect LSR constructions on the side |
| `DNR:HOLD-PSS-AF1-FINRA` (+ charter §14) | Raw short ratio / off-exchange share forbidden as standalone direction | TP-2's signed inference is a *different construction* — per-print NBBO aggressor classification (quote rule), a measured procedure with **disclosed coverage rates per venue stratum and a literature-cited method whose equity signing ACCURACY is UNMEASURED here** (we hold no aggressor ground truth; live-vs-historical agreement in §9 is reproducibility, not accuracy). It ships display-tier, framed as classified flow, and **cannot enter any promotion gauntlet until a pre-registered accuracy design exists** (§4.4). The killed construction (raw share ⇒ verdict) stays dead. Frozen-family seals untouched: TP stores are **new files**; nothing appends to `data/finra_short_volume/panel.parquet` |
| `DNR:KILL-INTRADAY-CHRONICLE` | Intraday lanes advancing nightly-owned stores | Restated as TP law: the tick plane writes ONLY its own R2 stores + live-dir artifacts; every forward ledger advances via nightly |
| `DNR:KILL-REGIME-SCORECARD` + `DNR:KILL-COMPOSITE-REGIME-RELIABILITY-MONITOR` | Fusing gamma/vol/flow/breadth/positioning into composite regime verdicts (positioning-fusion illegal) | §4 ships per-signal observations only; **no "institutional flow score", no fused dial** — confluence chips reference individual keys through the existing risk_radar→market_state chain |
| `DNR:KILL-NIGHTLY-HARD-GATE` | Hard-gating downstream jobs on collector success | Tick-plane producers fail soft: staleness via disclosure + heartbeat; consumers render honest nulls |
| `DNR:KILL-DIRECTIONAL-SHORTING` | Short-side reads as SHORT calls | Any short-flavored TP context (SSR flags, short-volume cross-checks) is AVOID-only evidence |
| `DNR:KILL-FRESH-TICKS-WINDOW` | Prophet admission "ticks" window widening | Naming discipline: TP never uses "ticks" for Prophet-adjacent features (the word is claimed); trade-print features are named `tape_*`/`prints_*` |
| `DNR:KILL-CHARM-NARRATIVES`, `DNR:KILL-DOI-FAMILY`, `DNR:KILL-SKEW-DECELERATION` | Killed options constructions | TP-7 cadence work surfaces observed greeks drift only; none of these constructions return via "intraday" re-skins |
| `DNR:HOLD-THETA-TAPE` | Theta tape lobe SUSPENDED (Final3-lobes program) | TP treats the options tape as an operating *production* feed for the flow desk but builds no new lobes on it; the hold's lift belongs to its program |
| `DNR:HOLD-WF-OPTIONS` | W-F options track PARKED | TP-7 does not advance it |
| `DNR:HOLD-IGNITION-SURFACES` | Live-ish predictive "radar" surfaces suspended pending ≥30 graded calls + operator ruling | TP surfaces are **observational desks** (what printed, what is elevated vs own baseline), never "igniting/warming" predictions; any alerting rides existing alert_triage precision floors |
| `DNR:KILL-PUBLIC-INTERNALS` | Internals on public surfaces | TP receipts cite product artifacts only (CXI-R23 unchanged) |

---

## §3 Target architecture — the tick plane

Design law: the render budget is untouched (all ingest off-path), GHA hosts no daemons
(BP R6: "cadenced lanes run on OUR metal"), the public repo carries no paid payloads
(public-repo law), and every store answers "who heals it, who watches it, who retires it"
before it exists (§3.6).

### §3.1 Placement

- **Ingest daemon**: VPS systemd unit (`app/deploy/` pattern, like `macro-sentinel`),
  running from the VPS deploy tree; secrets via the existing env file mechanism, key name
  `POLYGON_API_KEY` (alias `MASSIVE_API_KEY`). The VPS is 24/7, already fronts
  `/ws/tape`, and BP R6 assigns quote-driven lanes there. The Mac fleet is the fallback
  home (launchd + `run_with_env.sh` + dedicated deploy-tree doctrine) if VPS CPU/egress
  measures tight in TP-1's pilot.
- **Heavy compute**: Mac fleet launchd (idle through RTH; §7½ census) or nightly
  offrender siblings (`needs: engine, if: always()`) — never the render path.
- **Browser fanout**: NOT in scope for TP-1 (no per-user tick streaming). Site panels
  read R2-derived JSON at existing cadences; a `/ws/tape`-style fanout for Terminal is a
  §6 decision **after** measured demand (mirrors §7½'s worker-deferral logic).

### §3.1b Connection-ownership law (single-WS constraint)

The plan allows **one simultaneous WS connection per cluster** — and whether the
delayed and real-time endpoints are one bucket or two is **untested** (the TP-0
Saturday 1008 cannot decide it; TP-0.5 gate 1 exists to decide it). Two candidate
clients exist in the estate: this repo's TP-1 daemon (to build) and Terminal's Quote
Hub (`hub/lib/polygon.js`, today subscribing `AM.*` only, with auto-demote-to-delayed
on a real-time-denial frame). Law:

1. **The TP-1 ingest daemon is the sole owner of `socket.*/stocks` (real-time).**
   Recorded in a connection registry block in this doc + the daemon's runbook; any
   second real-time client is a defect, not a config choice.
2. **Terminal's hub pins `HUB_POLYGON_CLUSTER=delayed`** until TP-5, when it migrates
   to consuming TP-1's derived per-minute stream (via co-located macro-api or R2) and
   drops its own vendor socket for US equities. Its auto-demote behavior is the interim
   safety net, not the design. **If TP-0.5 shows delayed and real-time share ONE
   bucket, the hub migration moves INTO TP-1's wave** (the daemon cannot take the slot
   until the hub is off it — shipping a Terminal quote outage as an architecture is
   the named failure this law exists to prevent), with the hub's REST-snapshot
   fallback bridging the cutover.
3. **The paging predicate is post-`auth_success` `1008`/`max_connections`** — NOT auth
   failure. The vendor delivers entitlement/slot denials AFTER a successful auth (the
   hub's own code documents this: "RT entitlement denied arrives AFTER auth_success").
   TP-1's supervisor reads the hub's `/health` effective cluster before first connect
   and on every eviction.

**§3.1b.4 — measured semantics (TP-0.5 gate-1 experiment, run 2026-08-08 ~13:05Z):**
delayed and real-time ARE separate buckets (a held RT socket coexisted with a fresh
delayed connection; delayed-alone connected clean twice) — the hub keeps its delayed
socket and TP-1 does not fold the hub migration in. But overflow **EVICTS THE OLDEST
connection** (a second RT connection authed and survived while the original holder
was 1008-killed mid-hold) — the vendor does not refuse the newcomer. Consequences,
binding on TP-1:
   - **Singleton discipline is existential**: any stray second RT client (debug
     session, re-run probe, second daemon instance, blue/green overlap) silently
     kills production. Systemd single-instance + a startup check that refuses to
     start when the breaker shows the daemon healthy elsewhere.
   - **Slot-fight detection**: a 1008 arriving within N seconds of our own
     (re)connect means something else is competing for the slot — page immediately,
     do NOT enter an evict-each-other reconnect loop (this exact loop is the best
     explanation of TP-0's Saturday delayed-1008: the probe evicted the hub, the
     hub's auto-reconnect evicted the probe back).
   - **Probes never touch the RT cluster while the daemon lives**: the weekly
     entitlement tripwire verifies RT via REST (`v2/last/trade`/`last/nbbo`) only;
     WS probes of the stocks RT cluster require the daemon's maintenance window.

### §3.2 Universe policy (storage is the binding constraint, not API calls)

Full-SIP capture is a firehose (quotes ~O(10⁹)/day market-wide) and is **rejected**.
Tiered capture instead:

- **Tier A — full trade capture + NBBO classification**: pilot = the options/GEX
  universe (`gex_symbols()`, ~375) ∪ Prophet US actives ∪ index/sector ETFs, **hard
  cap 600 symbols** (a bounded set, not two unbounded unions — overflow drops
  lowest-ADV names, logged). Trades stored per-print (~50-80M/day market-wide; this
  tier is a fraction); quotes **never stored raw** — consumed in-flight for
  classification, only per-minute spread/imbalance summaries persist. TP-1's PR mints
  the measured GB/day envelope for the cap; §9's storage tripwire is inert until that
  number exists and arms the day it does.
- **Tier B — whole-market rollups**: no per-print retention; per-minute aggregates from
  the same feed for breadth/DP-share context (whole-tape `T.*` is affordable to *listen*
  to; storage is what's rationed). Enabled only after Tier A runs clean for a week.
- **Tier C — everything else**: grouped-daily + snapshot (already canonical via
  `massive_stock_day`).

### §3.3 Stores (all R2-private; naming provisional until TP-1's PR)

| Store | Grain | Retention (creep remedy applies to ⚡ rows) |
|---|---|---|
| `tick/trades/<yyyy-mm-dd>/<SYM>/part-<HHMM>.parquet` ⚡ | per-print, Tier A, **appended as intraday part files** (a symbol-day file rewritten every N minutes uploads O(N²) bytes — parts + EOD compaction upload each byte ~once) | 90d hot, then EOD-compacted archive; archive prunable by age |
| `tick/rollup_1m/<yyyy-mm-dd>.parquet` | symbol×minute | permanent — bounded by construction (KBs/name/day) |
| `tick/blocks/<yyyy-mm-dd>.parquet` | per block print | permanent — bounded by construction |
| `tick/oe_daily/<yyyy-mm-dd>.parquet` | symbol×day off-exchange summary | permanent — bounded by construction |
| `tick/health/<yyyy-mm-dd>.jsonl` | gaps, heals, classification rates | permanent — bounded |
| local spool ⚡ | crash-safe ring on the ingest host | ring-bounded; oldest-partition drop is LOUD (§3.6) |

Local spool survives R2 outages (replay on recovery). EOD compaction reconciles vs
grouped-daily (the 2% SIP self-consistency gate, §0/TP-1.3). §9's storage remedy names
the ⚡ rows — the "permanent" rows cannot creep by construction, and if one does, that
is a defect in its producer, not a pruning decision.

### §3.4 One classification home (corrected per review)

`engine/flow_signing.py` **already implements** the quote rule:
`quote_rule_sign` = quote rule with tick-test tiebreak at the midpoint, and it is
already the shared signer for the options-tape callers (`engine/tape_flow.py`,
`engine/live_flow.py`). TP does NOT re-add it. TP-1 adds a **new, additive entry
point** (working name `classify_print`) in the same module that (a) returns the
4-bucket vocabulary `buy | sell | mid | unclassified` + the quote-age that justified
it — `mid` is a bucket the existing tiebreak deliberately collapses, so the existing
callers' contract is untouched (no signature or behavior change to
`quote_rule_sign`); (b) is imported by both the live daemon and any historical
backfill, so live and historical paths cannot drift. **Sequencing with M4:** M4 is
chartered to touch this same module for the options-side migration — TP-1 lands the
additive entry point first (or rebases onto M4 if M4 lands first); neither wave
modifies the other's functions, and the PR that arrives second carries the
reconciliation note.

### §3.5 Timestamps

`participant_timestamp` (venue) is the event time for microstructure work;
`sip_timestamp` for tape-sequence work; wall-clock only for freshness. **TRF-reported
prints are the exception and get their own policy:** they are late-reported by
construction, and their participant stamp is frequently absent or not meaningful — a
TRF print is signed against the NBBO at `participant_timestamp` when present and
sane (≤ session bounds, ≤ sip), else at `trf_timestamp`, else labeled `unclassified`;
the stratum's stamp-availability rates are disclosed in TP-1's PR body. Every derived
artifact states which stamp it used. Nanoseconds survive parquet as int64 — no
datetime truncation in stores; humanize only at render.

### §3.6 Ops covenant per store

Producer registered in the freshness breaker; private-plane beacon (§0 TP-1.4); a
documented heal command; a retirement condition ("if unread for 90 days, retire the
producer"). No heartbeat-only adapters: the breaker asserts **content advanced**, not
process-exited-0 (binding precedent: 21 nights of silent `{"blocked":"no_creds"}`).
Host discipline (load-bearing because a 5s quote-age window rides nanosecond stamps):
NTP sync asserted at daemon start + hourly (refuse to classify when measured skew
> 1s — quote-age becomes fiction); spool-full behavior defined (oldest-partition
drop with a loud breaker event, never a silent wedge); key/credential rotation
runbook lines for both the API key and the private-bucket creds.

## §4 What Advanced uniquely enables (the signal catalog)

Ordered by (evidence-of-demand × buildability). Everything enters **display-tier free**
(nulls never block building); authority requires the §4.4 gauntlet. Confluence framing
throughout — a factor that is null standalone is retained as a confluence input.

### §4.1 Off-exchange / institutional prints (the dark-pool desk's missing tier)

The desk today: FINRA daily short-volume (T+0 ~18:00 ET) + weekly ATS attribution
(2-4wk lag). Advanced adds the **same-day, per-print** layer it declared pending:

1. **Real-time off-exchange share** — TRF volume ÷ consolidated, intraday cumulative vs
   each name's own baseline. Two measurement laws baked in from the audit: baselines
   are **minute-of-session-conditioned** (off-exchange share has a strong intraday
   shape — a 10:00 cumulative scored against a full-day distribution manufactures
   morning z-spikes; F7's median/MAD discipline fixes the estimator, this fixes the
   conditioning), and **split-guarded in-wave** (TP-B computes `share_break_index`
   baseline restarts itself from the entitled splits endpoint — F6's BKNG z=+53.7
   ghost is the precedent; no waiting on M5).
2. **Block tape** — large prints with lit/off-exchange venue leg, session tag
   (pre/RTH/AH), and NBBO-relative placement (at bid/mid/ask). Tiers are
   **dual-reported**: absolute notional ($100k/$500k/$1m, the vendor-tutorial
   convention users recognize) AND ADV/percentile-relative (a $100k print is a
   different event in F vs in a $3 microcap; the relative tier is what feeds any
   z-scored context). Copy says "large prints" — size is measured; who traded is not
   (no "institutional" attribution in glance copy; the ATS-character blend in 2b is
   the honest actor-context layer).
2b. **ATS-character blend (the named-dark-pool layer)** — each live off-exchange
   observation carries the name's trailing FINRA venue split as context: ATS fraction
   (true dark pools) vs wholesaler vs bank-desk vs unattributed, from the ALREADY-SHIPPED
   weekly collectors (`finra_ats_transparency`, `finra_otc_nonats`) and
   `knowledge/darkpool/otc_firm_roles.yaml`. Copy law: the blend is a **labeled
   historical heuristic** ("~31% of AAPL's hidden volume typically routes through true
   dark pools — weekly FINRA, 2-4wk lag"), never a live measurement; a live print is
   attributed to a TRF pipe (201/202/203), never to a named ATS. Named-venue truth
   arrives on FINRA's clock and back-fills the desk's weekly tier — the fast signal and
   the slow attribution are two layers by design, not a gap to paper over.
3. **Signed off-exchange flow** — quote-rule classified TRF prints, aggregated to
   buy/sell/mid/unclassified notional. Display-tier with the measured **coverage** rate
   per stratum printed on the card; the method is literature-standard but its equity
   signing **accuracy is unmeasured here** (§2.4) and the copy never overstates that.
   Different construction than what PSS-AF1 killed (classified prints, not inferred
   direction from share) — and it still cannot touch authority without the §4.4
   accuracy design + gauntlet.
4. **Repeat-print levels** — price levels where off-exchange notional repeatedly
   concentrates; rendered as level chips with recurrence counts. Recurrence is the
   measurement; "accumulation" is an actor-intent claim the data cannot make, so the
   word does not appear (§11.16).
5. **After-hours block monitor** — AH TRF prints joined to that evening's
   earnings-wire/press-wire events; feeds the earnings desks' "what moved after the
   close" context.
6. **Off-exchange acceleration** — day-over-day and intra-day slope of DP share on
   names already flagged by Prophet/standouts (confluence chip, never standalone).
7. **Sector/board rollups** — off-exchange notional flow by sector/basket via the
   existing membership spine, feeding sector rotation desks as context columns.

### §4.2 Microstructure & breadth (whole-tape listening)

8. **True real-time breadth** — advancers/decliners/new-highs from the live tape.
   **This contradicts two standing decisions of the tape-scoreboard charter and is an
   AMENDMENT PROPOSAL to that program, not an offer**: its D6 chartered breadth as a
   full-market snapshot join, explicitly NOT per-name websocket, and its D2 assigned
   any future Polygon WS to slot behind its relay. TP-1's ingest socket exists for
   artifact production regardless (that decision is this plan's); whether breadth
   presentation ever consumes a TP artifact is that charter's call via its own
   amendment — until then their snapshot-join breadth stands, upgraded to real-time
   labels by M1 alone.
9. **Spread/liquidity regime** — per-minute effective spread + top-of-book imbalance
   summaries (from the in-flight NBBO cache; never raw quote storage) → a liquidity
   stress chip for risk overlays; also the execution-quality context Mastermind needs.
10. **Halt/LULD monitor** — halts and reopenings as events on the wire desks.
11. **Odd-lot share** — odd-lot % of prints as a context column. NOT claimed as an
    institutional/retail separator: odd-lot share is dominated by share price (a $900
    name prints odd lots mechanically) and by post-2014 algorithmic slicing — the
    column ships price-normalized (vs same-price-band peers) or not at all.
12. **Opening/closing structure** — opening-range formation from second-aggs; MOC
    imbalance *proxies* from the closing print cluster (labeled proxy — we do not have
    exchange imbalance feeds; no fabricated "imbalance" claims).

### §4.3 History-enabled (flat files: trades to 20y, quotes where entitled)

13. **Baseline truth for every intraday z** — 2-5y of per-name DP-share/block-rate
    distributions so day-one intraday z-scores aren't cold-started (the audit's F5
    lesson: never ship a 47-day baseline again).
14. **Event studies at print resolution** — earnings/headline reaction latency and
    depth (joins press-wire/earnings-wire stamps to the tape); produces the "how fast
    does this name absorb news" per-name profile the wires can cite.
15. **Signed-flow history for gauntlets** — the backtest substrate for every §4.1
    promotion attempt (quote-rule over historical NBBO where flat-file quotes are
    entitled; tick-rule fallback labeled where not).
16. **Execution-cost curves** — spread/impact by time-of-day per name (Mastermind's
    slippage model input; receipts live in that repo).

### §4.4 Promotion gauntlet (unchanged house law, restated as the contract)

Display → authority requires: pre-registered gate doc (hypothesis, eras, FDR family,
kill criteria) BEFORE the joined look; walk-forward on the §4.3 substrate; nulls printed
either way; "validated" never emitted (CI-enforced); falsifier language never
user-facing (watch-conditions only). A null keeps the factor as display + confluence
input — the search continues, the specific construction closes.

**Additional clause for signed-flow factors (B4):** no signed-flow construction enters
any gauntlet until a **pre-registered accuracy design** exists for the classifier
itself — an estimator of signing accuracy against something that is not the same
classifier on another data path (candidates: a purchased labeled sample, an
exchange-direct aggressor-flagged feed, or a designed natural experiment; live-vs-M4
agreement measures reproducibility and is expressly insufficient). Until that design
exists and runs, signed flow is display + confluence context, permanently capped.

## §5 Waves

Model routing per house law: Opus builds (`builder`), Opus reviews (`reviewer`),
Sonnet censuses, Fable (main loop) adjudicates/ratifies. Every wave = fresh worktree off
`origin/main`, one PR, `merge-on-green`, live verification. Gates: §0.

| Wave | Scope (repo) | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| **TP-0** | Probe + manifest + this plan (macro) | — (this PR) |
| **TP-0.5** | Concurrency probe (delayed↔realtime buckets), RTH WS re-probe, quote-depth rungs, flat-file LIST probes, marketstatus-based calendar in the probe | TP-0; **blocks TP-1 design freeze and TP-B's quotes branch** |
| **TP-1** | `engine/tick_plane/` ingest daemon + spool + **private R2 plane (new bucket + creds + credentialed beacon)** + health + VPS systemd unit + pilot-universe RTH soak; hub migration folds in if TP-0.5 proves one shared connection bucket | TP-0.5 |
| **TP-2** | Off-exchange intraday desk tier (builders + `darkpool.html` sections + ledger accrual via nightly) | TP-1 stores |
| **TP-3** | Signal factory: blocks/shelves/AH monitor/sector rollups as synapse-registered artifacts + desk cards | TP-1; TP-2 patterns |
| **TP-B** | History backfill: flat-file trades (+quotes where entitled) for Tier-A universe → R2; baseline calibration pack | TP-0 (parallel to TP-1/2) |
| **TP-4** | Prophet/engine confluence columns + breathing-lane artifact offers (BP consumes at their choice) | TP-2/TP-3 + TP-B baselines |
| **TP-5** | Terminal bridge (charting-app PRs): desk mirrors + chart overlays via R2/intel bridge | TP-2/TP-3 artifacts; §6 census |
| **TP-6** | Event microstructure: wire×tape joins, reaction profiles, AH-block × earnings joins | TP-1 + TP-B |
| **TP-7** | Options cadence upgrade: intraday snapshot passes + live-spot greeks context (existing entitlements only) | TP-1 (spot feed); probe verdicts |

Wave sizing: TP-1 is deliberately the **only** infrastructure wave; every later wave is
artifact/product work on top of its stores. If TP-1's pilot week fails its gates, nothing
downstream has been built against fiction — the plan degrades to M-waves + EOD tiers
(which ship regardless).

### §5.1 Commissioning prompts (spawn-handoff law: gates travel with the prompt)

Later waves get their prompts minted by the commissioning session at dispatch time
(context changes between waves); TP-1/TP-2/TP-B/TP-5 are pinned now because their specs

## §6 Terminal track (charting-app) — census-grounded

The Terminal was *designed* for this purchase: its founding architecture doc names the
"Polygon/Massive full-SIP tier" as the target primary vendor, and its Databento design
doc + options audit both record TRF prints as a named gap whose "only route" is exactly
this feed. Census facts that bind the build:

- **Estate today:** options flow = SSE from the co-located macro-api
  (`127.0.0.1:8000` on the SAME VPS — this repo's FastAPI serves Terminal directly) with
  R2 fallback (`flowSource.ts` `backendPath()`/`r2Key()`); root options vendor is
  ThetaData on the Mac fleet → R2. The equity WS leg is the Node Quote Hub
  (`hub/lib/polygon.js`, `AM.*` only, systemd `quote-hub.service`). Dark pool exists
  only as the EOD context belt (FINRA, labeled "NOT prints, NOT live"). No equity
  time-and-sales, no Level-2, no equity block feature anywhere — all net-new surface.
- **Transport for TP-5 already exists**: extend `flowSource.ts` upstream paths +
  macro-api endpoints + the public R2 bucket keys — the same three-rung ladder the flow
  desk uses today. No new infra class needed for desk mirrors.
- **Chart overlays** target the in-progress `terminal/lib/chart-engine/` contract
  (never raw Lightweight-Charts call sites): DP shelves/levels via the
  `createPriceLine` pattern (the "Options Levels R3.1" overlay at
  `ChartPanel.tsx:1519` is the template), block prints via `createSeriesMarkers`,
  anything richer (shaded DP bands, in-canvas tape strip) via the `ISeriesPrimitive`
  template (`sessionShading.ts`).
- **Gating:** new features key off macro-api `/api/me` `features[]` (the
  `terminal_live_options` precedent) — feature flags minted on the billing side of THIS
  repo; `entitlement.ts` 45s positive-cache consumes them. Tiers free/essential/pro.
- **i18n:** self-contained surfaces get a sibling `xxxStrings.ts` lexicon (the
  `flowdeskStrings.ts`/`gexStrings.ts` precedent); chrome strings go to `i18n.tsx`.
- **Pre-build audit:** two unmerged branches likely contain reusable prototypes —
  `claude/massive-financials` (Massive fundamentals client) and
  `claude/live-rt-second-bars` (`HUB_REALTIME_QUOTES`, second bars, measured-freshness
  labels). TP-5's builder audits both before writing new client code. The Terminal
  working tree may sit far behind `master` — TP-5 branches from `master`, always.

Binding decisions:
1. **One producer, two faces.** Terminal renders artifacts this repo produces (macro-api
   + R2), exactly like the flow desk today. No second vendor ingest in Terminal; the
   Quote Hub *sheds* its vendor socket per §3.1b rather than gaining channels.
2. **D4 lift: commissioned, pending ratification.** The operator's 2026-08-08 ask
   names Terminal explicitly — that is the commission, and this plan treats it as
   intent. But D4 lives in the roadmap's plan-of-record, and plan-of-record changes
   move by ruling, not by inference from a commission. **TP-5 dispatch is gated on the
   ruling**: one line appended to `LIVE_FLOW_PRODUCTION_ROADMAP_BY_FABLE.md` §6 (or
   operator confirmation on the TP-5 PR) recording the lift. Scope once lifted: desk
   mirrors + chart overlays + tape panels reading TP artifacts; a Terminal-native
   per-user streaming tick feed stays a later, measured decision
   (HOLD-IGNITION-SURFACES-adjacent caution: observational surfaces only).
3. Tier-gating server-side; debrand law (no vendor names user-facing); LIVE badges obey
   the measured-freshness law (a badge reflects data freshness, not transport
   liveness — the flow desk's ~48-min-loop lesson is the cautionary precedent).
4. Options intraday flow upgrades ride TP-7 cadence artifacts (existing OPRA
   entitlements), not claimed new options data.
5. Concrete TP-5 deliverables (each its own charting-app PR, spec-first per the
   design lane): (a) **Hidden Flow desk mirror** (off-exchange share, block tape,
   ATS-character context) beside the EOD belt it upgrades; (b) **on-chart DP levels +
   block markers** overlay toggle; (c) **equity time-and-sales pane** for Tier-A names
   (from rollup + block artifacts, honest cadence label); (d) hub migration off its
   vendor socket (§3.1b.2).

## §7 Options track — what Advanced changes and what it doesn't

Facts (2026-06-21 probe + TP-0 re-probe): options tape/quotes remain un-entitled unless
the manifest says otherwise; snapshot (OI/IV/greeks) + minute/day flat-file aggs remain
entitled. Therefore:

1. **Cadence, not tape:** an RTH snapshot pass every N minutes (politeness-tuned) on the
   GEX universe → intraday GEX/IV drift context (`intraday_greeks.py` exists; it gains a
   real intraday spot from TP-1 instead of delayed snapshot spot). Display-tier chips on
   gex.html / flow desks: "dealer gamma drifting long/short since open" as observed
   deltas, no forecasts.
2. **Equity-leg upgrades to existing options analytics:** live underlying spot for
   strike-distance/moneyness; NBBO spread context for the screener's liquidity columns;
   second-agg underlying bars under 0DTE charts.
3. **Signed options flow stays on the ThetaData production feed** (calibration ratified
   #1292; `DNR:HOLD-THETA-TAPE` suspends the Final3-lobes tape *lobe*, and TP builds no
   new lobes on the tape). M4 retires the databento crutch on the equity side only. The
   roadmap's P6 15-min tier earn-in now has its transport (TP-1 infrastructure + TP-7
   cadence artifacts) — the earn-in condition (demonstrated desk usage) is unchanged.
4. If the TP-0 manifest shows the options bundle DID change (any 403→200 on OPRA
   trades/quotes), §7 re-scopes by amendment with its own prereg — not silently.
5. **Procurement decision, explicitly deferred (operator's when demand proves):**
   Options Advanced ($199/mo, separate product) would add real-time OPRA trades+quotes —
   true live sweeps/blocks with NBBO signing, replacing the poller-loop cadence
   honestly. The trigger mirrors T3e's discipline: measured flow-desk usage + a written
   case that the ThetaData plane can't serve the demanded latency. Until then, no OPRA
   real-time claims anywhere.

## §8 Cross-engine integration map

| Consumer | Input from this plan | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| Prophet US (eyes-open/anticipation) | DP-share z, block/AH-block flags, signed-flow confluence chips | nullable columns + coverage floors; display until gauntleted |
| Breathing lane (BP W-L2) | real-time breadth artifact, second-agg opening structures | offered artifacts; BP owns presentation + evaluator use |
| Dark-pool desk | the entire intraday tier (§4.1) | desk page + forward ledger via nightly |
| Neural Web / brain | new synapse artifacts per §4; market_packet gains a compact "tape block" (aggregation-only, A7 intact) | synapse registry + lobe grades |
| Earnings/press wires | AH block joins, reaction-latency profiles | wire desks cite; no effect/beneficiary invention (TI-R5) |
| Mastermind (sister repo) | spread/impact curves, DP shelves as execution context | R2 read contract; execution receipts stay in that repo |
| Calibration Lab | every gauntlet verdict, promotion or null | below-the-fold receipts per falsifier-language law |

## §9 Risks, falsifiers, kill criteria

- **Feed discipline:** if the daemon cannot hold ≥ 99% session coverage over the pilot
  week (net of vendor outages), TP-2+ do not build; fix or re-home first (the gate is
  the feed, not the calendar).
- **Classification honesty:** if live quote-rule classification (vs the M4 historical
  join on the same days) disagrees on signed-notional sign for > 10% of name-days,
  signed surfaces stay dark until reconciled — magnitude-only ships regardless (the
  OPTIONS_FLOW precedent: direction soft, magnitude reliable).
- **Storage creep:** tick bucket > 2× the envelope TP-1's PR mints (tripwire inert
  until that number exists, armed the day it does) for 2 consecutive weeks → halt
  Tier-B, re-model, prune the §3.3 ⚡ stores (per-print archive + spool — the
  bounded-by-construction stores are not prunable remedies; one of them creeping is a
  producer defect). No silent growth: growth must trace to universe × days, nothing
  else.
- **Program-level falsifier (usage review):** at TP-3 merge and again at TP-6 merge, a
  measured usage review over every TP surface shipped so far — surfaces without
  demonstrated reads get retired or demoted to data-only, and the program halts
  surface expansion (data plane may continue) until something earns its screen space.
  HOLD-IGNITION-SURFACES exists because surfaces outran their gates; this program
  schedules its own reckoning instead of waiting for one.
- **Budget law:** any nightly step this plan adds that exceeds its declared minutes in
  the timings ledger for 3 consecutive nights → the step moves offrender or dies; the
  render budget is not negotiable.
- **Epistemic drift:** any TP surface caught asserting direction from unsigned share,
  emitting "validated", or advancing a forward ledger intraday → halt the wave,
  re-adjudicate against §2.4/§4.4 (these are the exact failure modes the estate already
  paid for once).
- **Vendor drift:** entitlement probe re-run (weekly cron + before each TP wave);
  a 200→403 regression freezes dependent waves and pages the operator (manifest diff in
  the alert).

---

## §10 Budget & storage math (bounded, revisited at TP-1 merge)

- **Render path:** +0 minutes (nothing in this plan touches render).
- **Nightly:** TP-2 rollup read ≤ 5 min (offrender/collect_tail); ledger accrual ≤ 1 min.
- **VPS daemon:** one WS connection, one core-ish decode budget at Tier A (pilot
  measures; Tier B only if headroom proves out), R2 egress trivial (rollups are MBs).
- **R2 (private plane):** Tier-A per-print trades expected low-GB/day pre-compaction at
  the 600-symbol cap — TP-1's PR replaces "expected" with the measured envelope that
  arms §9's tripwire; rollups MBs/day; blocks KBs/day. TP-B backfill sized before pull
  (flat-file LIST first, budget in the wave PR, hard cap declared) — never an
  unbounded crawl.
- **API:** unlimited-calls plan, but M2's politeness law governs concurrency; the probe +
  daemon share the existing key with no new key surface.

## §11 What NOT to build (standing rejections restated for this program)

1. No full-market raw quote retention (firehose; classification is in-flight only).
2. No standalone direction verdicts from share/ratio constructions (PSS-AF1 stays dead).
3. No user-facing "dark pool prints" labels on TRF data — off-exchange semantics with
   ATS attribution only where FINRA weekly provides it (R5).
4. No falsifier/refutation vocabulary user-facing; watch conditions only (07-27 law).
5. No vendor names on customer surfaces (debrand law); no paid payloads in the public
   repo (R2-private only).
6. No browser tick-streaming to end users until a measured-demand decision (mirrors the
   §7½ worker deferral); no per-user WS fanout in TP-1.
7. No indices/futures/fx/crypto claims (not entitled).
8. No LLM-originated signals/scores/escalations anywhere in the plane (A7).
9. No new schedulers on GHA for live cadences (jitter-disqualified; BP R6 metal law).
10. No re-cutting the PSS-AF1 tamper seal; new stores are new files, unions at read time.
11. No composite "institutional flow score" or fused regime dial from TP inputs
    (KILL-REGIME-SCORECARD / KILL-COMPOSITE-REGIME-RELIABILITY-MONITOR — positioning
    fusion is illegal); per-signal chips only, composed only by the existing
    risk_radar→market_state chain.
12. No FMV usage (Business-tier only — not entitled); no Benzinga-endpoint assumptions
    ($99/dataset add-ons, not bundled).
13. No second real-time stocks WS client, ever (§3.1b single-connection law).
14. No predictive "igniting/warming" framing on any TP surface (HOLD-IGNITION-SURFACES
    boundary): desks state what printed and what is elevated vs its own baseline.
15. No "ticks" vocabulary in Prophet-adjacent features (KILL-FRESH-TICKS-WINDOW claims
    the word for admission sessions); tape/prints vocabulary only.
16. No "accumulation clusters" / "institutional prints" vocabulary anywhere — both
    assert actor intent/identity the tape cannot measure (the PSS-AF1 inference in
    fresh words). House terms: "repeat-print levels", "large prints".
17. ~~No user-facing or Terminal-facing TP surface before the vendor terms are filed
    under `research/licenses/`~~ — **SATISFIED 2026-08-09.** The §0 global licensing
    gate is CLOSED; record at `research/licenses/MASSIVE_ENTITLEMENT_RECORD.md`.
    The debrand rule (items 15–16 above) is untouched: the vendor is still never
    named on a public product surface, even though attribution is not required.

## §12 Status log

| Date | Event |
|---|---|
| 2026-08-08 | Plan authored on operator commission; TP-0 probe + manifest shipped in the same PR; census lanes (repo, Terminal, registry, vendor) + live probe grounded §1–§6. |
| 2026-08-08 | TP-0.5 gate-1 + gate-3 measurements run same-day (scratchpad harness; durable probe upgrade ships as the TP-0.5 wave): WS buckets SEPARATE (delayed ≠ RT) but overflow EVICTS-OLDEST (§3.1b.4 — singleton discipline, slot-fight paging, REST-only tripwires while the daemon lives); REST `v3/quotes` depth verified to 2005; S3 LIST verified `trades_v1`+`quotes_v1` to 2005-06 with 2024 quote files ~4.8GB/day gz (TP-B quote strategy re-scoped to episode windows + per-name REST). TP-1 design freeze is UNBLOCKED on the bucket question; TP-0.5 still ships the durable probe + RTH data-frame re-proof. |
| 2026-08-08 | Adversarial review (opus) returned HOLD: 4 blockers, 10 material, 8 minor — ALL accepted and folded pre-merge. Structural consequences: §0 gains the global licensing gate (B3) and wave TP-0.5 (B2/m1/m2); TP-1 now mints the PRIVATE R2 plane first (B1 — the existing publisher/beacon serve the public bucket only); the PSS-AF1 distinction restated on measured COVERAGE with signing accuracy explicitly unmeasured + a §4.4 accuracy-design prerequisite for any promotion (B4); stratified classification gates + TRF timestamp policy (M8); gap-heal quote replay + dedup key (M1); minute-of-session baselines (M2); in-wave split guard for TP-B (M3); part-file store layout (M4); 600-symbol cap + envelope-minting (M5/M6); §3.4 corrected to the additive `classify_print` contract with M4 sequencing (M7); tape-scoreboard D2/D6 tension named as amendment-proposal (M9); program-level usage falsifier at TP-3/TP-6 (M10); vocabulary bans extended (m3/m4); D4 lift marked ratification-pending (m8). Wave order is now TP-0.5 → TP-1. |
