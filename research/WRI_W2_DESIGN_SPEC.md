# WRI W2 — design spec of record (pinned, v2)

Date: 2026-07-24 (v2 same day — operator feedback: "more premium, match macro.html", braid v1
read as "cartoon noodles"). Parent: `WATCHLIST_RISK_INTELLIGENCE_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md`
(§0 gates bind). Pinned artifact: **`mockups/wri/watchlist_risk_mockup.html`** — the exact
markup/CSS W3 copies. Reference crops: `mockups/refs/wri/01–05` (dark stress/calm, zh, light,
mobile). Verified live in preview (all five variants + calm lens + console-clean). Design
decided per DESIGN_DOCTRINE + frontend-design skill in the Fable main loop; W3 is
implementation only — deviations come back here first.

## 1. The design in one line

The page's thesis is a verdict — "Your 8 names move as 2 bets" — set in macro.html's
gradient-ink type and proven by the **bets patch-bay** (signature element): one hairline
multi-filament cord per holding dropping into a bus rail, cords of the same bet landing on a
shared segment; a two-lens toggle re-patches it for calm tape vs selloffs, and re-words the
verdict ("Calm days: 6 groups. Selloffs: 2 bets").

## 1b. macro.html idiom ported (v2 — the premium layer)

- **Aurora backdrop**: fixed blurred radial washes (violet .10 + green .07; lighter in light
  theme), z-0 behind a z-1 content wrap — the mx5 atmosphere.
- **Hairline tiles**: cards = 1px `color-mix(line 72%, transparent)` border, translucent panel
  fill, 12px radius, hover lift — the ms-sig anatomy; no fat borders anywhere.
- **Gradient-ink verdict** (the macro `v-thesis` treatment): h2 clamp(19–24px)/800/-.02em,
  `background-clip:text` gradient from the book-state hue to an info blend; hue driven by
  `data-state` on the hero (ok/tilt/conc/one). State chip = mono letterspaced hairline chip
  with glowing dot in the same hue.
- **Mono micro-labels**: every eyebrow, section head, table header, tick, state token, chip
  label in `--font-mono` 10–11px uppercase letterspaced (.10–.16em) — numerals tabular mono.
  Typeface stays the house pair (self-hosted Inter + SF Mono stack) — premium comes from
  treatment (gradient ink, weight discipline, letterspacing), not a new font download.
- **Bars**: 7px tracks `rgba(255,255,255,.07)` (light: `rgba(10,25,40,.08)`), fills
  `linear-gradient(90deg, hue@40% → hue)` — the mx5-factor-bar idiom.

## 2. Page order (top → bottom)

1. Header panel (existing) — subtitle gains "…and what your book really is / 以及你的组合到底押了什么".
2. **L3 regime rail** — one line: market read (baked `risk_radar.dominant_label_*` + state tint)
   · book beta sentence (client) · "market state →" link. Tint = state ramp, NOT --up/--down.
3. **L2 Book Risk hero** — eyebrow (BOOK RISK · as-of) → verdict h2 + state chip → one so-what
   sentence → lens toggle → braid (≥561px) / bucket list (≤560px) → three sub-cards →
   one merged footnote with `?` method receipt.
4. Sync/account bar, controls, **watchlist card grid** (existing cards + L1 additions).
5. **Portfolio table** + two new columns (Share of book risk w/ mini-bar · Risk read).
6. Export/import details (unchanged).
`#fx_panel` is **absorbed**: sub-card 1 replaces its top block; its full beta table, shock
scenarios, and weight editor move into a `<details>` drawer inside sub-card 1 (Tier-2 home).
Weight plumbing (`FX.setAutoWeights` / `mdash.fx_weights.v1` fallback) is reused as-is.

## 3. Tokens (scoped under `.wri` / `.wri-rail`; theme.css untouched)

- Risk-state ramp (never --up/--down — zh-flip trap): `--wri-ok #3fb98d · --wri-tilt #d9a13c ·
  --wri-conc #e2703a · --wri-one #e05252`.
- Factor hues: mkt #8fa4b8 · growth #9a7bff · size #4fc3d9 · rates #5f8dff · usd #7fae72 ·
  oil #d9903c · china #e0645c · btc #f0a13c · gold #d4b23c · idio #66788c.
- Numerals: `--wri-mono: ui-monospace, "SF Mono", …` (ui-monospace leads — Chrome serif trap).
- All tints via `color-mix` over theme tokens → light/dark for free (verified crops 01/04).

## 4. Verdict + states (L2)

- **Lens-aware verdict** (decided in critique): stress lens is the DEFAULT (WRI-R7); flipping
  to "All days" re-words the verdict line, e.g. "On calm days: 6 groups. In selloffs: 2."
  The braid cluster count drives the sentence (picture-true); measured ENB prints only in
  sub-card 1 ("effective bets ≈ 2.1 of 8 names").
- State chip from ENB (stress lens): ≥4 "Spread out / 分散", 2.5–4 "Leaning one way / 偏向一侧",
  1.5–2.5 "Mostly one bet / 高度集中", <1.5 "Effectively one bet / 实为单一押注". Chip color =
  ramp. Thresholds print in the `?` receipt as heuristic v0.
- So-what sentence formula: top factor + its share + consequence + what moves independently.
  Review language only; no advice verbs; ≤ 2 lines at 760px.
- **Abstain state:** >40% of book dollars unmodeled → verdict = "Not enough modeled names to
  read the book / 可建模持仓不足，暂不给出组合判读" + chip listing unmodeled tickers. No state chip.
- **Empty/thin:** <2 weighted names → hero collapses to one invitation line (empty state is
  an invitation, not a mood).

## 5. Patch-bay spec (signature, v2 — replaces the noodle braid)

- SVG viewBox `0 0 1000 192`. Ticks (mono 10.5px) y=12; faint dotted vertical guides
  (`stroke:var(--line)`, dash `1 6`, .55) per name from y=20 to the rail.
- **Cords, not strokes**: each holding = a bundle of 1.25px hairline filaments,
  `count = min(6, 1 + round(|share|·14))` spaced 2.6px — weight is conveyed by filament
  count at hairline weight, never by fat strokes. Hedges: dashed `5 4` + `⇄` on tick/label.
- Geometry: drop vertical `M x,24 L x,92`, then ONE late tight cubic into the rail landing —
  engineering bend, no S-swoosh. Landings distribute along the segment
  (`bx = seg.x + seg.w·(k+.5)/n`) so member cords fan into their bus like cables.
- **Bus rail**: full-width 1px hairline at y=150; each cluster = a 2.5px segment on it, length
  ∝ cluster risk share (min 56px, renormalized), square end-ticks ±4px. **Only the dominant
  cluster carries saturated hue + drop-shadow glow**; all other segments/cords lean
  `color-mix(hue ~50%, muted)` — restraint is the premium.
- Labels: mono 10px uppercase .1em under segments (stagger +13 when <96px & odd); dominant
  label ink-bright, rest muted. **No numbers on the braid** (v1 critique ruling stands).
- Clusters = connected components of the twin graph (ρ ≥ 0.70) under the active lens.
- Motion: draw-in ONLY on first paint (`.animate` class removed after ~1.4s) — lens/lang
  re-renders swap instantly (replay jank + mid-draw screenshots were a v1 bug); hedge cords
  exempt from the draw trick (dasharray conflict); `prefers-reduced-motion` → static.
- `role="img"` + aria-label summarising clusters; bucket-list fallback ≤560px (hairline rows:
  swatch + bet name + member tickers, singleton dedupe).
- **Lens-aware verdict** (§4) is DEMONSTRATED in the mockup: `setLens` swaps the h2 wording
  (stress: "Your 8 names move as 2 bets" / calm: "Calm days: 6 groups. Selloffs: 2 bets");
  the state chip stays pinned to the stress read.

## 6. Sub-cards (L2)

1. **What drives your swings / 波动的来源** — factor variance-share bars (factor hue), idio row
   "Stock-specific / 个股特有", ENB line beneath; `?` = model receipt. Drawer (`<details>`):
   full per-name beta table + shocks + weight editor (absorbed FX panel).
2. **Move as one / 同涨同跌** — twin chip-groups; stress-only joins tagged "joins in selloffs /
   跌市中并入" + one-line why; calm lens dims stress-only rows (opacity .45).
3. **Biggest single risks / 最大单一风险** — top 3–4 positions by |MCTR share| with bars;
   negative rows green + "offsets the book / 对冲组合" note line.

## 7. L1 — cards + portfolio table

- Chips (max 3 at rest + `details` toggle; overflow lives in drawer). Vocabulary (EN/ZH),
  driven by lane states per masterplan §8 field mapping:
  Earnings in Nd/财报N天内 (hot ≤5d) · Stretched/过度拉伸 · Below trend/跌破趋势 ·
  Estimates falling/盈利预期下调 · Debt watch/债务关注 · Insiders selling/内部人卖出 ·
  Shorts rising/空头增加 · Rate-sensitive/利率敏感 · N% of book risk/占组合风险N% (info, from L2) ·
  moves with X/与X同步 (info twin) · price signals only — not in the risk model/仅价格信号——未纳入风险模型.
- Role badge top-right ONLY at ≥review: Review/复查 · Take-profit review/止盈复查 ·
  Exit review/离场复查 (ramp-tinted). Quiet (`ok`) names show nothing.
- Drawer rows: label (muted, 118px) + state token (OK/WATCH/plain-word elevated) + one plain
  reason ≤ 1 line + single as-of. Lane names are plain words (Price & trend / Stretch / Events /
  Estimates / Balance sheet / Who's selling — 价格与趋势/拉伸度/事件/盈利预期/资产负债/谁在卖出).
- Portfolio table: `Share of book risk` col (mono % + 44px mini-bar, negative → green
  "offsets") + `Risk read` col (role badge or —).

## 8. Compliance mapping (doctrine §5 checklist)

5-second test: verdict sentence IS the answer. Stance: so-what line + role badges (review
verbs). Banned vocab: none on Tier 1 (no ENB/MCTR/corr/z on glance — "corr ≥ .85" appears
only inside sub-card 2 body: **move it to the `?` tip in W3** — flagged). Numbers carry
meaning (Law 3): every % arrives inside a sentence or labeled bar. One as-of (eyebrow), one
merged footnote + method receipt. ZH parity verified (crop 03). No `title=` translated text —
mockup uses `title` on `?` glyphs: **W3 converts to `data-tip-en/zh`** (flagged). Nulls plain:
unmodeled chip + abstain state. honesty: "Measurement, not a forecast" footnote retained.

## 9. W3 builder checklist (hand this + mockup + crops)

1. Port mockup CSS into `templates/watchlist.html.j2` `<style>` (scoped `.wri*`); add rail +
   hero sections; absorb `#fx_panel`; extend cards/table per §7. `templates/risk_core.js`
   (pure math per masterplan §7) + `templates/watchlist_risk.js` (render; braid builder from
   mockup JS, data-driven). PAIRED site/ copies via `python -m scripts.check_template_site_sync --fix`.
2. Server inputs: build_site passes `window.WRI_REGIME` (risk_radar state + dominant_label_en/zh
   + vol_regime.regime + asof) into the template; everything else client-side from
   factor_betas.json (+W1 stress block) & stockdata JSONs.
3. Fix the two flagged items (§8): corr receipt → tip; `title=` → data-tip-en/zh.
4. Lens-aware verdict per §4; abstain/empty states; reduced-motion; keyboard focus on toggle
   (aria-pressed) + details; braid aria-label.
5. Verify against production-shaped data in preview (not curl); crops light+dark+zh in PR body;
   nav-gap + banned-vocab + template-site-sync CI green; **no self-merge** (masterplan §0.2).

## 5-A. W3 adjudication record (2026-07-24, orchestrator ratification)

The W3 build surfaced that §5's cluster rule (twin components at implied ρ≥0.70) is
unreachable on the calm lens for real books: factor-IMPLIED pairwise correlation is capped
at √(r²ᵢ·r²ⱼ) ≈ 0.5–0.6 for typical names (each ~50% idio under the 9-factor model, which
carries no industry factors — shared semi-industry moves count as idio). The literal spec
produced "7 names move as 7 bets" beside a "mostly one bet" chip.

**RATIFIED (builder decision #1, PR #3405):** the patch-bay picture + verdict count group by
dominant factor-bet, verdict count = round(ENB) — the same construct family as the state
chip, so the surface cannot self-contradict. The ρ≥0.70 twin rule remains the "Move as one"
card's standard (honest "literally track each other" claim; populated mainly under the
stress lens). Riders: the twins card must show a plain-word empty state on the calm lens;
the verdict phrasing uses "about N bets". Model-limitation come-backs recorded in the
masterplan lane: (a) evaluate an industry/subsector factor extension, (b) add GLD/IAU to
the factor model's ETF universe (gold factor exists; GLD currently reads unmodeled).
