# XPV2-SC-R3B.1 — EN/ZH copy ledger, Lane A (authority hero repair)

Commission: `research/reference_integrity/mastermind-xpv2-sector-r3b-1/COMMISSION.md`
Fix packet items covered by this lane: **R3B1-01 · 02 · 03 · 04 · 05 · 06 · 07 · 13**.

This ledger records **every EN/ZH pair Lane A rendered into the successor
artifact**, whether restored from a producer field, restored verbatim from a
production template, or authored by this lane. It supplements — it does not
replace — `research/reference_integrity/mastermind-xpv2-sector-r3b/copy_ledger.md`,
which still governs every string the predecessor cycle minted.

Every pair below was read back out of the **built** artifact
(`proposal/MASTERMIND_SECTOR_CENTRAL_R3_CANDIDATE.html`) with headless Chromium
on 2026-08-22 — the "rendered" column quotes `innerText`, not source — so no row
is retyped from memory.

**Provenance vocabulary** (same three values the predecessor ledger uses, plus one):

- **producer-field** — the whole string is a value read out of a fixture
  artifact at the frozen epoch. The reference supplies no words at all.
- **bound-from-production (verbatim)** — the words are copied unchanged from a
  named production template/JS file; the numbers inside them are producer values.
- **bound-from-production (recomposed)** — production's own words, re-punctuated
  or re-ordered for the R3 grammar, with **no semantic change**. Every instance
  is itemised in §4.
- **authored-new** — this lane wrote both halves; no production string exists.

## 1 · R3B1-01 — the position-sizing directive

Producer: `basketdata/baskets.json → theme_intel.regime_sizing`
(`schema vol_regime.sizing.v2`; at the frozen fixture `active: true`,
`gross_scalar: 0.81`, `mech_scalar: 0.81`, `regime_caution: 1.0`,
`scored_cut: 1.0`, `regime: "normalizing"`,
`caution_passport.verdict: "display-only"`).
Render site: `build/views/overview.html`, `sizingHTML()`, marker `data-r3b1="01"`.
Inert-when-calm rule reproduced from **`templates/sector_central.html.j2:2888`**
(`if(!rs||!rs.active||(rs.gross_scalar||1)>=1.0) return '';   // inert when calm`).

| EN | ZH | provenance | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `positions sized to 81%` | `仓位缩至 81%` | bound-from-production (verbatim), `sector_central.html.j2:2919` | `81` is `Math.round(gross_scalar*100)` — production's own rounding, no other arithmetic. |
| `How position sizing is set` | `仓位如何设定` | authored-new | Accessible name for the receipt control (`.r3-vh`). Production's chip has no accessible name at all; house law forbids `title=` and a single-language `aria-label`. |
| `How it's set: volatility target 81% → 81%` | `计算方式：波动率目标 81% → 81%` | bound-from-production (verbatim), `:2905-2912` | Receipt line 1. `risk regime` / `signal mix` legs and the `N theme(s) eased to hold-only` clause carry production's guards and are correctly inert on this fixture (`regime_caution` and `scored_cut` are both 1.0; zero themes carry `regime_demoted`). |
| `Read from US volatility, applied on every market page. Volatile markets get smaller position sizes. This does not change the basket ranking.` | `依据美国波动率读数，各市场页面同用此读数。波动加大时降低仓位；不改变篮子排序。` | bound-from-production (verbatim), `:2907` / `:2911` | Receipt line 2. Production joins lines 1 and 2 with ` \| `; the reference separates them with a newline (§4, R-1). |

Not rendered, correctly: production's `showNote` branch (the risk-off shadow
caution and its Tier-2 caution-passport receipt) requires
`regime_caution_shadow < 100` **and** a mapped `regime` label. This fixture has
`regime_caution_shadow: 1.0` and `regime: "normalizing"` (unmapped), so the
branch is inert and **no stand-in copy was invented for it**.

---

## 2 · R3B1-02 — the leadership methodology caveat

Producer: none — this is production template copy governing
`si_handoff.json → theme_context.leadership`.
Render site: `overview.html`, `paintContext()`, marker `data-r3b1="02"`.
Source: **`templates/sector_central.html.j2:2155`**.

| EN | ZH | provenance | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `How this works` | `原理说明` | bound-from-production (verbatim), `:2155` | The control's **visible** label. Production renders it as `ⓘ How this works`; the glyph is dropped because §9.3 of the design spec forbids typed marks (the receipt's `?` ring is drawn in CSS). |
| `Shape read only — not a forecast.` | `仅为形态读数，非预测。` | bound-from-production (verbatim), `:2155` | Clause 1 of the disclosure. Promoted to **first** line (§4, R-2). |
| `Trailing-momentum rank names Memory, HBM & Storage first; skips the most recent ~3 weeks by construction; suggested weights unchanged.` | `趋势动量排名以内存、HBM 与存储居首；设计上跳过最近约3周数据；建议权重不变。` | bound-from-production (verbatim), `:2155` | Clause 2. The theme name is the producer's `trailing_leader.name` / `.name_zh`, interpolated exactly as production interpolates it. |

## 3 · R3B1-03 · 04 · 05 · 06 · 07 · 13

### 3.1 R3B1-03 — migration note

| EN | ZH | provenance | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Money is moving into Software and out of Semiconductors.` | `资金正流入软件，流出半导体。` | **producer-field** — `si_handoff.json → theme_context.migration.note_en` / `note_zh` | Rendered verbatim, escaped, `data-r3b1="03"`. Production's site is `sector_central.html.j2:2130`. Absent field renders as absence. |

### 3.2 R3B1-04 — the working destination

| EN | ZH | provenance | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Open the playbook` | `打开操盘手册` | bound-from-production (verbatim), `sector_central.html.j2:2163` | Real `href="allocation.html"` + `data-ref-nav` (the recorder path every other off-page destination on this board uses). Production types a trailing `→`; the R3 system draws the chevron as a CSS border (`.r3-more::after`), so the arrow character is dropped — §4, R-3. |

### 3.3 R3B1-05 — hero enrichment

Producer: `baskets.json → theme_intel.themes[].perf.<win>.rel`,
`themes[].pulse_rank_delta_5d`, `baskets[]`, `categories[]`. Looked up through
`REF.themeById()`, the shim's mirror of production's `themeById()`
(`sector_central.html.j2:2877`). Production sites: `:2926`, `:2928-2933`.

| EN | ZH | provenance | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `was #1` | `原第一` | bound-from-production (verbatim), `:2143`, `:2929` | Pre-existing in the predecessor; now the head of the enriched line. `data-r3b1="05a"`. |
| `-9.6% 20d` | `-9.6% 20日` | **producer-field** (`memory_storage.perf.20d.rel = -0.0959`) | Unit deviation recorded in §4, R-4. |
| `+11.5% 20d` | `+11.5% 20日` | **producer-field** (`big_pharma.perf.20d.rel = 0.1154`) | `data-r3b1="05b"`. |
| `climbing fast` | `快速上行` | bound-from-production (verbatim), `:2933` | Guarded on `pulse_rank_delta_5d > 0` (here `9`). |
| *(5d clause)* `-N.N% 5d` | `-N.N% 5日` | **producer-field**, guarded | Production renders the outgoing leader's 5d **only when it is negative** (`:2930`). This fixture's `memory_storage.perf.5d.rel` is `+0.0433`, so the clause is correctly inert — **NOT_EXERCISED on this fixture**, code path present. |
| `· 49 themes · 15 categories` | `· 49 个主题 · 15 个分类` | bound-from-production (verbatim), `:2926` | `.length` over two full producer lists — the same mirror production performs. `data-r3b1="05c"`. |

### 3.4 R3B1-06 — context score terminology

No new pair. `theme_intel.themes[].score` already carries exactly one name on
every context surface of this build — **Strength / 强度** (`map.html:84`, marker
`data-r3b1="06"`), **Strength / 强度** in the scatter tooltip (`map.html:576`)
and **Strength score / 强度评分** in the selected-object list (`map.html:628`,
production's own label at `sector_central.html.j2:2991`). See §5 for the residual
exposure this leaves on Overview.

### 3.5 R3B1-07 — S&P thin-coverage sentence

Producer: `marketdata/subsector_confluence.json → coverage`
(`n_subsectors: 113`, `n_gateable: 65`, `n_thin: 48`). Render site:
`confluence.html`, `paintFoot()`, marker `data-r3b1="07"`.

| EN | ZH | provenance | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `65 of 113 subsectors have enough live data to time.` | `113 个子行业中，65 个实时数据足够，可用于计时。` | bound-from-production (recomposed), `templates/subsectors.js:220-221` | Only the sentence boundary changed (a full stop replaces the ` · ` that joined it to the thin clause). Noun swaps per universe, unchanged. |
| `48 are too thin to time and are omitted from the timed table.` | `另有 48 个数据过于稀疏，无法计时，未列入下方计时表。` | bound-from-production (recomposed), `templates/subsectors.js:220-221` | **This is the corrected clause.** Production says `48 thin (listed in the table, not timed)`; the 48 are gate-dropped and never enter `subsectors[]` at all (113 − 65 = 48, and the table renders exactly 65 rows). §4, R-5. |

Renders on S&P only at this fixture: Nasdaq and Russell carry `n_thin: 0`, so
the thin clause is inert there; `basket_confluence.json` emits no `n_gateable`,
so the Baskets tab renders **nothing** here — the BLOCKED_DATA ruling stands and
no Baskets thin disclosure was invented.

### 3.6 R3B1-13 — the Stock-picks figure label

Producer: `marketdata/subsector_confluence.json → double_gated.double_buy[].combined_score`.
Contract: **`engine/subsector_confluence.py:322-324`** — *"combined_score = stock
cascade weight × subsector buyability factor"* — value written at **`:347`**
(`round((m["stock_weight"] or 0.0) * sub_factor, 4)`).
Production's own header for that exact field: **`templates/subsectors.js:330`**.
Render site: `confluence.html`, `paintPicks()`, marker `data-r3b1="13"`.

| EN | ZH | provenance | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Conviction` | `综合把握` | bound-from-production (verbatim), `templates/subsectors.js:330` | Used as the `.r3-cols` column header **and** as a `.r3-vh` accessible name inside every picks row, so the figure is never a naked decimal to a screen reader either. Not "Score", "Probability", "Confidence" or "Strength" — none of those is a claim the contract makes. |
| `Stock` | `个股` | bound-from-production (verbatim), `templates/subsectors.js:330` | Column 1 header. |
| `Why it is here` | `入选原因` | pre-existing in this build (`overview.html:676`, `confluence.html:669`; picks header at `confluence.html:753`) | Column 3 header — reused, not minted. |

## 4 · Recomposition register — every departure from production's exact wording

| # | What changed | Why | Semantic change? |
|---|---|---|---|
| R-1 | The sizing receipt's two halves are separated by a **newline** instead of production's ` \| ` pipe. | Commission R3B1-02/§"no paragraph tooltip": a receipt reads as short statements, not a run-on. `.r3-tipbox` gained `white-space:pre-line`; every pre-existing single-clause tip carries no newline and is byte-unchanged. | None. |
| R-2 | The caveat's two clauses are **re-ordered** — `Shape read only — not a forecast.` leads, the construction-lag clause follows. | The non-forecast caveat is the clause that governs how the whole band may be read (DAC-102). A reader who reads one line must read that one. | None — both clauses render, verbatim, in one disclosure. |
| R-3 | Trailing `→` dropped from `Open the playbook →`; trailing `ⓘ` dropped from `ⓘ How this works`. | DESIGN_SYSTEM_SPEC §9.3: marks are drawn (CSS borders/pseudo-elements), never typed. Both controls draw their mark. | None. |
| R-4 | `perf.<win>.rel` is rendered **×100** (`-9.6%`), not through production's `fmtPct()` (which appends `%` to the raw fraction and prints `-0.10%`). | The identical producer byte (`-0.0959`) is already rendered `-9.6%` by the action board **on this same view** (`overview.html` `rowHTML()`, from `action_board.json`'s `perf_20d_rel`, which `scripts/build_site.py:1784` copies from the same theme record). Printing one number at two magnitudes on one screen would make the reference teach a production unit defect as migration law. | The producer byte is unchanged; only its scale is stated once, consistently. **Flagged for Sol** — see §5. |
| R-5 | `48 thin (listed in the table, not timed)` → `48 are too thin to time and are omitted from the timed table.` | Commissioned repair R3B1-07 / DAC-105. Production's wording is false against its own payload. | Yes — deliberately. This is the commissioned correction, and it is a **production-repair delta for R3C**, not a licence for the reference to re-word producer copy generally. |

---

## 5 · Open items this ledger hands forward

1. **R-4 unit deviation (§4).** Lane A rendered the hero's relative performance at
   the same magnitude the board uses. If Sol wants byte-identical fidelity to
   `fmtPct()` instead, the change is one helper in `overview.html`
   (`relTxt()`), and the correct home for the repair is then production's
   `fmtPct` call sites, not the reference.
2. **R3B1-06 residual.** The Overview action board's figure column is headed
   `Score / 评分` (reference-authored — production renders the number bare,
   `_us_act_now_board.html.j2:490`). Its value is `action_board.json`'s `score`,
   which `scripts/build_site.py:1784` sets to `th.get("score")` — i.e. it **is**
   `theme_intel.themes[].score`, verified identical for all 33 theme rows in this
   fixture. The commission's R3B1-06 explicitly carves that column out
   ("Do not rename the independent action-board score"), so Lane A did not touch
   it, and DAC-107's one-measure-two-names exposure therefore survives on
   Overview. Sol's call.
3. **`Conviction` collides across two artifacts.** `Conviction / 综合把握`
   (Confluence picks, `combined_score`) and `Conviction / 信心`
   (Overview trace card, `sectordata/sector_central.json → conviction.score`) are
   two different measures sharing one EN word. Both labels are production's own,
   so neither is the reference's to rename. Producer-side naming item for R3C.

## 6 · Lane B (accessibility + token repair) — appended; nothing above is altered

Fix packet items covered by this lane: **R3B1-08 · 09 · 10 · 11 · 12**.

Lane B is a geometry, token, ARIA and plumbing repair. Four of its five items
render **no new words at all** — R3B1-09 changes wrapping, R3B1-10 changes an
attribute value, R3B1-11 changes token rungs and type sizes, R3B1-12 changes
element ids. The only user-facing strings this lane added are the accessible
names the three Moving help controls had been missing, which is the whole
substance of R3B1-08: before this repair a nonvisual reader heard "question
mark, button" three times and could not tell the three apart.

Every pair below was read back out of the **built** artifact with headless
Chromium on 2026-08-22 — see `build/lane_crops_b/01_moving_help_open_*.png` and
`05_moving_help_named_open_390_dark_zh.png` for the rendered EN/ZH disclosures.

### 6.1 R3B1-08 — the three Moving help controls

Render site: `build/views/moving.html`, `trackRecordHtml()`, marker
`data-r3b1="08"` on each control. The disclosure TEXT is unchanged: two controls
carry the pre-existing reference-authored `data-tip-en/zh` sentences and the
third carries the producer's own `track_record.disclaimer` / `disclaimer_zh`.
Only the NAMES are new.

| EN | ZH | provenance | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Rank fit — how this works` | `排序吻合 — 原理说明` | authored-new | `aria-label` on the Rank-fit column-header control. Names the concept the column already prints, then the house disclosure phrase, so a screen reader announces which of the three it has landed on. Concept half is the column header verbatim (`Rank fit` / `排序吻合`); disclosure half is production's own `sector_central.html.j2:2155` pair — the same one Lane A bound for R3B1-02. |
| `Reliability — how this works` | `可靠度 — 原理说明` | authored-new | `aria-label` on the Reliability column-header control. Same construction. |
| `Scorecard method — how this works` | `记分卡方法 — 原理说明` | authored-new | `aria-label` on the scorecard's method control. This one also carries a VISIBLE label (next row); the accessible name contains that visible label in full, so WCAG 2.5.3 Label in Name holds in both languages. |
| `How this works` | `原理说明` | bound-from-production (verbatim), `templates/sector_central.html.j2:2155` | The visible label on the scorecard method control (the `--named` receipt variant). Reused, not minted: it is the identical pair Lane A bound for the leadership caveat, deliberately so, because it is the identical control doing the identical job. One explain vocabulary, one explain idiom. |

The two column-header controls stay visually bare — a ring, no label — for the
reason Lane A recorded for the same variant: a footnote whose subject is already
on the line does not need to repeat it, and "RANK FIT ?" reads as one phrase. The
scorecard control is the case Lane A's own rule sends the other way — a method
disclosure with no subject on the line — so it wears the label.

### 6.2 Items 09 · 10 · 11 · 12 — no new pairs

- **R3B1-09** (severe-zoom reflow): geometry only. The Money verdict's vol chip
  wraps instead of being cut, the sizing directive's row wraps at 160 CSS px, the
  receipt control gained `position:relative`, and the treemap now measures its
  labels before printing them. **No wording changed**, in either language.
- **R3B1-10** (document language): the only value introduced is the language TAG
  `zh-CN`, and it is production's, not this lane's — `templates/theme.js:600`,
  `:614` and `templates/_public_chrome_js.html.j2:110` all write exactly that.
  No visible copy is involved.
- **R3B1-11** (contrast/type): token rungs and font sizes. Every string it
  touches — `Still measuring / 测量中`, `Clears the bar / 已达标`,
  `20d vs market / 20日对比市场`, and the action/risk state vocabulary — is
  pre-existing and **byte-unchanged**; only the ink and the size moved.
- **R3B1-12** (duplicate ids): `id="ref-data"` → `id="ref-data-<n>"` on the 22
  embedded registry blocks. Not user-facing; nothing reads the id (the registry
  is keyed by `data-path`).
