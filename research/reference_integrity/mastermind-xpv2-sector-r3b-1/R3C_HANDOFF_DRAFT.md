# R3C production-migration handoff — DRAFT, DO NOT START

**Status: DO NOT START.** This file records the live-integration conditions the R3C
production-migration wave must satisfy, per the R3B.1 commission ("Stop condition": an R3C
draft carrying ONLY live-integration conditions; "R3C-only conditions — record, do not
implement"). R3C may begin only after (1) the four NEW fresh critic seats review the frozen
R3B.1 successor SHA, and (2) Sol approves that exact SHA. Nothing in this file authorizes
implementation. It supersedes the predecessor's
`mastermind-xpv2-sector-r3b/R3C_HANDOFF_DRAFT.md` as the live R3C record once the successor
freezes; that file remains predecessor history.

## §1 Live-integration conditions (commission "R3C-only" list, verbatim scope)

1. **Time Machine live oracledata episode/chunk fetch** — the reference's manifest-only TM
   (disclosed "the manifest is real; the frames are not carried here") is NOT the data
   contract. Bind production episode/chunk producers.
   (`mastermind-xpv2-sector-r3b::product_regression::PRC-001`.)
2. **Real `whenAuthSettled` and authenticated hydrate path** — the reference's drawer-driven
   access states are a harness; implement from the R3A access/hydration contract
   (single premium wall = premiumdata/sector_central.json, tier_payload.v1, silent
   401/403/5xx/offline no-op), not from the harness drawer.
3. **Real `/premiumdata/` 403/offline behavior** — URL-level enforcement is a production-server
   property the artifact cannot execute (`product_regression` NOT_EVALUABLE SC-018).
4. **Current `si_workspace.js` router law** — reuse verbatim at migration time; re-verify the
   sha against origin/main then (freeze-time sha256 dfab9118…).
5. **Heatmap `stock_url` bytes** — destinations remain the producer field, never rebuilt.
6. **No Baskets thin/gateable invention** — BLOCKED_DATA ruling stands (SC-066).
7. **No correction/revision invention** — BLOCKED_DATA ruling stands (SC-092).
8. **Upstream `category_zh` gap** — producer emits it zero times; untranslated Explore
   category chips are a PRODUCER repair, not a template one (predecessor copy_ledger §4).
9. **Upstream generic `reco_why` copy quality** — 105 rows / 8 distinct strings is producer
   output; improving it is an engine-side work item.
10. **Site-wide relative-unit typography debt** — the px-only type ramp is a verbatim mirror
    of production (`mastermind-xpv2-sector-r3b::visual_taste::VTC-014`, advisory); a
    rem/em migration is a platform-wide decision outside any sector-central wave.

## §2 R3C inputs from the critic cycle (recorded, non-binding taste/composition)

- Map quadrant scatter non-chromatic encoding (shape / direct labels / leader lines) so a
  named leader is findable without hover — within the reserved-hue law
  (`::visual_taste::VTC-001`, second-pass downgraded).
- Explore 1440 default-open CATEGORY filter costs 136px of first-viewport data; revisit the
  desktop default-open state (`::visual_taste::VTC-002`, downgraded).
- Universe-tab selected state at 320 is a hairline-only distinction; Money style/risk grid
  leaves an empty cell (`::visual_taste::VTC-011/VTC-013`, upheld minors — taste tier).
- Optional Group-pulse column: either demonstrate with pulse.json or keep production's
  absent-column fail-soft explicit in the migration packet (`::product_regression::PRC-002`).
- Heatmap reachability: keep reachable without a dead-end; first-viewport absence is not
  removal (`::product_regression::PRC-003`).
- Producer-side naming collision: two producers both label their field "Conviction" —
  `subsector_confluence.combined_score` (综合把握, `templates/subsectors.js:330`) vs
  `sector_central.json → conviction.score` (信心). Both labels are production's own;
  disambiguation is an engine/template naming item, not a reference change (R3B.1 Lane A
  GAP-4).
- Production unit defect: `fmtPct()` applied to raw fractional `perf.<win>.rel` renders
  "-0.10%" in the hero while the same byte renders "-9.6%" on the action board of the same
  view. The R3B.1 reference renders one consistent board-scale value (adjudications §4.2);
  production should fix the hero's `fmtPct` scale rather than inherit the dual-magnitude
  rendering.

## §3 Inherited required dependencies (carried from the predecessor R3C draft)

- Production sticky-hash scroll-offset repair (the reference's `--ref-sticky-offset`
  behavior is REQUIRED reference behavior; production must implement the equivalent).
- Validated-allowlist surfaces check (`scripts/check_validated_claims.py`) over any migrated
  copy before ship.
- The predecessor draft's §4 discovered production repair candidates (desk-watch
  outage-reads-as-calm, `renderFormingNarratives` defer race, leadership-strip emoji,
  `sc_flows` ZH gaps, chrome divergences adjudication) remain open production work items.

## §4 Design-system dependency (bounded, from R3B.1 Lane B)

If Lane B records a shared-token amendment need in `design_system_dependency_r3c.md`
(contrast repair that production theme.css would need for parity), R3C carries it as a
bounded Design-System dependency; the reference itself never edits production theme.css.

## §5 What R3C must NOT re-litigate

The R3B.1 do-not-reopen list is carried forward whole: six-view navigation/task order, State
Ledge, action/context authority split, Overview five-state structure, Bottoming Watch
role/placement, Map reserved-hue law, mobile Map quadrant recomposition, Moving
five-artifact binding, Money core composition, Explore task architecture, Confluence
universe order/distribution + active-universe isolation, premium arithmetic, canonical
router/hash law, sanctioned icon system, and mobile workspace nav at ≤359 = 2 columns ×
3 rows (Sol-ratified, `::mobile_accessibility::MAC-004` override).
