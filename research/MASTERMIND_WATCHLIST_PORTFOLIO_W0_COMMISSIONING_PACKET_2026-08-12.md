# Mastermind Watchlist + Portfolio — W0 Commissioning Packet (by Fable)

Date: 2026-08-12
Status: W0 census + commissioning output. Product authority: `research/MASTERMIND_PORTFOLIO_WATCHLIST_CEO_REVAMP_HANDOFF_2026-08-12.md` (CEO handoff, committed alongside this packet).
Repos: `mastermindx-market-intelligence/macro` (this repo) + `mastermindx-market-intelligence/mastermind-terminal` (local checkout `/Users/chriswong/Documents/Cluade/charting-app`, default branch `master`).
Predecessor charters amended by this packet: `research/UNIFIED_WATCHLIST_PORTFOLIO_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md` (UWP), `research/WATCHLIST_RISK_INTELLIGENCE_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md` (WRI), `research/PORTFOLIO_SUPERINTELLIGENCE_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md` (PSI), `research/PSI_MARKET_BOOKS_DESIGN_SPEC.md`.
Governance: display-tier Portfolio Health Score remains lawful per `DNR:KILL-FUSED-COMPOSITE` Amendment 2 (2026-08-03) under PSI §3.1.2 conditions; it is NOT a blocker for this program (handoff §7.3). The `MASTER_PRODUCT_INFORMATION_ARCHITECTURE_V1.md` §10 open decision on watchlist identity is RESOLVED by the CEO handoff: **Watchlist ≠ Portfolio; two concepts, one canonical relational store each** (see §14).

## §0 ACCEPTANCE GATES (program-wide; every wave PR cites the rows it proves)

**Semantic invariants (non-negotiable, tested in W1 and never regressed):**
- A. Add AAPL to Watchlist `AI` → `portfolio_positions` unchanged.
- B. Add NVDA to Portfolio → no watchlist row changes.
- C. NVDA in both; remove from Watchlist → Portfolio position remains.
- D. Close Portfolio NVDA → Watchlist membership remains.

**Cross-product sync (W1 exit):**
- Create `Gold Miners` (NEM/AEM/GOLD) in Macro → identical list + membership in Terminal.
- Create `Space` (RKLB/ASTS) in Terminal → appears in Macro.
- Add a portfolio position in Macro → Terminal `/portfolio` shows it; and the reverse.
- Migration is additive, idempotent (run-twice test yields identical state), conflict-safe (same name → merge symbols, dedupe), owner-scoped; never mass-deletes cloud state; records a migration marker only on success.

**Anonymous funnel (W2 exit):**
- Precondition (P0 defect §2.7): the watchlist UI bundle is anonymously loadable — the regwall 401s on pure-UI JS are cured (graded data artifacts stay walled) and verified with a cookie-free fetch.
- Clean browser, no login: enter 8 tickers → real risk + per-ticker analysis renders; refresh → session persists locally; Save → signup → local state folds ONCE into the account (no duplicate rows).

**Large-list law (W2 exit; regression-tested thereafter):**
- 55 and 100 names: all rows present (DOM count == list count), no cap, no horizontal page scroll at 390px, search/filter responsive, per-name details hydrate progressively, one failed ticker degrades one row — never the table or page.

**Risk correctness fixture (W3 exit):**
- 8 correlated tech names + GLD + TLT: tech concentration visible; effective bets materially below ticker count; GLD/TLT read as diversifiers where the model says so; stress lens can show convergence; no unmodeled ticker silently enters factor math.

**Coverage honesty (W3/W4 exit):**
- US + crypto modeled names, HK/CN/CA positions, one unsupported symbol: never fabricate a cross-currency total; per-market signals work where a store exists; factor model states its market coverage; unsupported rows stay visible with an honest state.

**Visual gate (every UI wave; commissioning review, no self-merge):**
- Crops: desktop dark EN, desktop light EN, desktop ZH, 390px dark EN, 390px ZH.
- States: anonymous empty, anonymous analyzed, signed-in Portfolio, 55-name Watchlist, per-ticker drawer, Risk Center, Scenario Lab, offline/local.
- Real data, browser-driven interactions (not staged HTML). Terminal waves additionally verify 1440×900 / 820×1180 / 390×844 and run `npm run test:e2e:responsive`.

**Performance/resilience (every wave):**
- Shell paints before ticker hydration; quote calls batched; polling pauses when tab hidden; nightly artifacts cached; no per-user holdings in repo artifacts; never log shares/cost basis; owner-scoped RLS preserved.

**Copy/design law (every UI wave):**
- `docs/DESIGN_DOCTRINE.md` + frontend-design skill before surface work; no new token system, header family, or card grammar; no unexplained ENB/MCTR/WRI/lane vocabulary at glance tier; technical names live in tooltips/method detail; descriptive language only — no buy/sell/add/hedge imperatives; "validated" banned (CI-enforced); bilingual EN/ZH with zh copy in templates AND builders; no translated text in `title=` attributes.

## §1 Current-state truth table

All rows verified 2026-08-12 against macro `origin/main` (8e90bc669ed) and terminal `origin/master` (c1abc9a0, read via `git show` — the shared checkout is dirty with a sibling's live work and was never trusted).

### 1a. Persistent stores

| Store | Kind | Schema/RLS source of record | Writers | Readers | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `watchlists` | Supabase (shared project `fsldfzlxyavsuwqbceod`) | Terminal `supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql` (owner policy `watchlists_owner`; unique `(user_id,name)`) | Macro `watchstore.js:125` auto-creates ONE list `'Watchlist'`; Terminal `terminal/page.tsx:61` seed-upserts `'Default'`. **No rename/delete path exists in either product** — Terminal list rename/delete/copy are localStorage-only (`TerminalShell.tsx:2234-2270`) | Macro `watchstore.js:113` (`.limit(1)` — first list only), macro brief fallback `app/main.py:1556` (service-role), Terminal `/terminal` + `/portfolio` pages, brain `get_watchlist` | Registered multi-list exists in schema, is unreachable from Macro, and is only half-reachable from Terminal (server lists render; only `Default` syncs) |
| `watchlist_symbols` | Supabase | Terminal `0001_init.sql` (`wls_via_parent` policy) | Macro `watchstore.js` fold `:222` / full-membership diff push `:277,:288` (insert+delete, single resolved list, debounced 600ms); Terminal seed + `POST /api/watchlist` add/remove/move (**first list only**, `route.ts:31`; remove/move batched ≤500 since #405) | Same set as above | `section`,`position` columns exist; **no note column** — Macro notes can never sync without a schema change |
| `portfolio_positions` | Supabase | **CREATE TABLE never version-controlled anywhere** (live since ≤2026-07-18); RLS only, in Macro `templates/uwp_supabase.sql` (4 own-row policies) | Macro `watchstore.js` full CRUD `:480-581` (client-direct under RLS, double `user_id` filter) | Macro brief positions-mode `app/main.py:1544` (service-role), brain tools | **Zero references in the entire Terminal tree** (`git grep portfolio_positions` = 0 hits) |
| `user_entitlements` | Supabase | Macro `scripts/deploy/0005_user_entitlements.sql` | billing | `_resolve_tier` → Pro gate on brief | Terminal `profiles.is_pro` is explicitly a UI hint only, trigger-locked |
| `mdash.watchlist.v1` | localStorage (macro origin) | shape `{v,updated,items:[{t,added,note}],order,settings}` | `watchlist.js:118` | `watchlist.js:112` | The anonymous/local watchlist AND the signed-in mirror; notes/order/settings live only here |
| `mdash.pf.v1` | localStorage (macro) | `{v,rows:[position-shaped]}` | `watchstore.js:353` | `:336` | Anonymous/local-mode portfolio; one-shot fold marker `mdash.watchstore.pf_folded.v1` |
| `mdash.book.v1` | localStorage (macro) | active book id | `market_books.js:182` | `:177` | Persisted market filter — silently shortens the rendered list (root cause §2.6b) |
| `mdash.fx_weights.v1`, `mdash.wl.seen.v1`, `mdash.watchstore.folded.v1` | localStorage (macro) | — | `factor_exposure.js:37` / `market_books.js:308` / `watchstore.js:237` | — | Manual factor weights fallback; seen-state snapshot; watchlist fold marker |
| `mm.wls` | localStorage (terminal origin) | `{lists:Record<name,{symbol,section}[]>, active, meta}` | `TerminalShell.tsx:1278` (sole writer) | Shell restore `:1215`, `PortfolioView.tsx:44,47` (read-only + storage event) | Named lists; **non-Default lists never touch Supabase**; guest seed = 6 hard-coded symbols |
| `mm.set`/`mm.setVersion`, `mm.flags`, `mm.railW`, `mm.devTier`, `mm.lastFlagColor` | localStorage (terminal) | — | `TerminalShell.tsx` | — | Watchlist display prefs / flags / rail width |
| `flowdesk.watchlist` | localStorage (terminal) | flat `string[]` | `FlowDeskView.tsx:112` | `:105` | **A second, unrelated watchlist system** (options-flow desk only). Out of scope — named here so nobody "unifies" it by accident |

Both products point at the same Supabase project (terminal-minted user JWTs authenticate against Macro's `/api/portfolio/brief` — same GoTrue issuer; UWP §2 records the shared `.mastermind-x.com` SSO cookie).

### 1b. Renderers

| Surface | Source | Population rendered |
|---|---|---|
| Macro `watchlist.html` | `templates/watchlist.html.j2` → `scripts/build_site.py:6337`; sole embedder of `wl_*`/`pf_*`/`bk_*`; 8 JS modules with hand-written `?v=N` (`:867-878`); nav entry = "Mastermind Portfolio" (`_navlinks.html.j2:228`) | Local blob (+ cloud-merged single list when signed in); portfolio section from `portfolio_positions`/`mdash.pf.v1`; WRI hero tile + always-open PRE-TRADE row (≥1 modeled holding); Account Sync bar `#wl_auth` |
| Terminal `/terminal` rail | `TerminalShell.tsx` | `mm.wls` named lists; `Default` reconciled with server (local order wins, server-only appended, local-only healed via idempotent add) |
| Terminal `/portfolio` | `app/(shell)/portfolio/page.tsx` + `PortfolioView.tsx` (`data-portfolio-watchlists="r5-v1"`, PR #386) | Sign-in-gated; server `watchlists`+`watchlist_symbols` merged display-only with `mm.wls`; ONE selected list → "Conviction Book" table ∩ `/data/manifest.json`; `PortfolioBriefPanel` above it fetches an unrelated population (§1c) |
| `committee.html.j2` | loads `watchstore.js?v=2` (stale stamp vs `v=3`) | Inert there (`watchstore.js:645` bails without host ids) — globals only |

### 1c. API / server surface

| Endpoint | Auth | Population | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Macro `GET /api/portfolio/brief` (`app/main.py:1573`) | bearer → Supabase user; Pro gate (`pro|unlimited` + `active|trialing`) | Open `portfolio_positions` if any (real shares/entry), **else union of ALL the user's watchlists, equal-weight nulls** (`:1556-1569`) | GET-only, no parameters — caller cannot name a population; service-role reads bypass RLS with hand-written `user_id=eq.` filters; 300s per-user cache; composes nightly `site/data/portfolio_ctx.json` via `engine/portfolio_brief.compose_brief` |
| Terminal `GET /api/portfolio-brief` (proxy) | server-verified session; mints bearer server-side | forwards verbatim — no list identifier exists to forward | 5-min token-keyed cache; 401 handled locally; 403 `pro_required` → teaser state; upstream default `https://mastermind-x.com` |
| Terminal `POST /api/watchlist` | Supabase user | **first watchlist only** (`.order("position").limit(1).single()`) | actions add (single) / remove / move (batched ≤500) |
| Brain tools `get_watchlist` / `get_portfolio_brief` (`brain_gateway.py:2785,2887`) | user id / + Pro gate | duplicate the same positions-else-watchlist-union load logic | `get_watchlist` is NOT Pro-gated (own data — fine, noted) |
| Nightly `scripts/run_watchlist_sentinel.py` | operator only (`SUPABASE_OPERATOR_USER_ID`) | operator's own watchlist → `data/alerts/watchlist_alerts.jsonl` | **Per-user alerts do not exist yet** (W6 material) |
| Sync | — | — | No sync endpoints exist; Macro syncs client-direct via PostgREST under RLS, Terminal via its own route/server components |

### 1d. The population mismatch, stated once

On Terminal `/portfolio` today: the **brief** describes `portfolio_positions` if any exist, else ALL-lists-union equal-weight; the **table** describes ONE selected list (possibly a local-only list the server has never seen) filtered by the Terminal manifest. Four independent divergence mechanisms plus undisclosed weighting divergence — see §2.2. The handoff's question ("do `/api/portfolio/brief` and `PortfolioView` describe the same population?") is answered: **no, not even usually.**

### 1e. Live production reproduction (2026-08-12; page stamp "Generated 2026-08-12 06:37 UTC")

- **Section order (anonymous, DOM order):** aurora decor → site nav → panel [h1 "Watchlist & Portfolio" + search + count] → `#wri_rail` regime rail (hidden) → `#bk_strip` books → `#tod_strip` → `#wri_hero` **BOOK RISK** (braid + analytic cards + PRE-TRADE CHECK live inside it) → `#wl_auth` **ACCOUNT SYNC** → banner → `#pf_section` **Portfolio** → `#fx_panel` → controls → `#wl_list` **watchlist cards (dead last)** → empty-state → export/import. Matches `templates/watchlist.html.j2` exactly (prod is current). Signed-in: cards start ~1,206 px down, under a ~700 px risk hero — the CEO's screenshot hierarchy confirmed.
- **Anonymous = dead husk (root cause §2.7):** ten scripts 401 (`x-regwall: deny`, `{"locked":true,…,"signin_url":"/?signin=1"}`); `window.SD/WL/MB/FX` undefined; visible text is just the heading, "Portfolio ?", a nightly-close line, and Export/import. No empty state (should be `block`), no sign-in CTA. The shell itself is `cache-control: public, max-age=60`.
- **55/100-name run (production HTML + current templates + real R2 data):** 55/55 and 100/100 cards in DOM and visible; 0 dropped, 0 `wl-gone`, 0 console errors, 0 failed requests; `#wl_list` has no max-height/overflow clip. Payload measured: 5.65 MB (55) / ~10 MB (100) of per-ticker JSON on one load. The "cutoff" is §2.6(a)+(b): headline printed "YOUR 45 NAMES" over the 55-name book (10 unmodeled names silently absent from the headline; braid plots 45/55), and at 55+ names every braid axis label overlaps its neighbour (53/54 pairs, min gap −17.6 units; at 100: 97/98, −32.5).
- **PRE-TRADE CHECK:** absent for anonymous (JS never runs); signed-in shows an empty ticker box beside a hardcoded **$10,000** (`W4_DEFAULT_DOLLARS`, `watchlist_risk.js:940`) — the contextless default the handoff flags.
- **Terminal contrast:** anonymous `app.mastermind-x.com/portfolio` renders a proper benefits regwall ("FREE ACCOUNT — … Watchlists synced across your devices …" + create/sign-in CTAs). The Terminal already does what the Macro page fails to do pre-signup.
- **Freshness/caching:** the eight watchlist-bundle scripts carry hand-written `?v=N` stamps while the rest of the estate uses content hashes (`theme.js?v=e07e6c36`) — confirms §2.9. Caveat: harness used the repo's `factor_betas.json` (2026-07-09) because the live one is regwalled — coverage *set* may differ nightly; the headline/braid *mechanisms* are code-pinned and not affected.

## §2 Root-cause list (ranked; every item verified against origin/main + origin/master 2026-08-12)

1. **Terminal `/portfolio` has the wrong semantic source — confirmed, total.** `terminal/app/(shell)/portfolio/page.tsx:40-53` reads only `watchlists` + `watchlist_symbols`; `PortfolioView.tsx:90` titles it "Conviction Book"; `git grep portfolio_positions origin/master -- terminal/` returns **zero hits** across the entire Terminal tree. PSI §20 itself documents "Terminal has NO portfolio_positions awareness." UWP W3 (Terminal parity) was chartered optional and never shipped.
2. **The Portfolio Brief and the table under it can describe different populations — four independent mechanisms.** `/api/portfolio/brief` (`app/main.py:1573`, GET-only, no parameters) returns open `portfolio_positions` if any exist, else the **union of ALL the user's watchlists** equal-weight (`main.py:1556-1569`). The Terminal table renders **one selected list** — which can be a local-only `mm.wls` list invisible to the brief — then drops symbols missing from `/data/manifest.json` (`PortfolioView.tsx:75`). Weighting also diverges silently (real shares vs equal-weight nulls). Nothing on the page discloses which population either panel describes.
3. **Macro registered sync is single-list by construction.** `watchstore.js:112-133` resolves ONE list (`.limit(1)`, auto-created) and every downstream op targets that `wlId`; header comment pins "W1 scope: ticker sync only — notes/order/settings remain localStorage-only." Multi-list was deferred (UWP W2.5) with named preconditions and never resumed.
4. **Terminal watchlist truth is fragmented.** Server tables + `mm.wls` named lists (`TerminalShell.tsx:1216,1278`) reconcile **display-only** (`portfolioWatchlists.ts`), while `app/api/watchlist/route.ts:31` still targets the user's FIRST list (`.order("position").limit(1).single()`). Three partial authorities (Macro primary-list, Terminal locals, Supabase) reconcile forever — exactly what the handoff forbids.
5. **Page hierarchy is inverted and the identity is mashed.** The WRI hero tile (`watchlist.html.j2:686` `#wri_hero`) mounts book-risk + always-open PRE-TRADE CHECK row (once ≥1 modeled holding) above the user's names; the Account Sync bar `#wl_auth` was frozen "(unchanged)" by the Books spec §4; the nav already sells the page as "Mastermind Portfolio" while the page h1 says "Watchlist & Portfolio". Holdings read as bolted underneath the risk architecture.
6. **The 55-name "cutoff" is the risk hero misrepresenting the list — MEASURED, not the table dropping rows.** Live reproduction (production HTML + real R2 data): at 55 and at 100 names, **every card renders** — DOM count == blob count, zero console errors, zero failed fetches, no CSS clipping, no cap. What a user actually experiences:
   - **(a) The hero headline prints the factor-modeled subset as the user's list.** `watchlist_risk.js:762-767` renders `held.length` — `cvg.modeled` after `MB.modeledOnly()` + coverage stripping — as "YOUR **45** NAMES MOVE AS ABOUT 2 BETS" over a 55-name mixed book (10 names silently absent: GLD/EEM/ARKK, crypto, foreign). The card-level "not in the risk model" chip is honest; the largest type on the page is not.
   - **(b) The braid axis mathematically collides beyond ~37 names.** `paintBraid` (`watchlist_risk.js:1249`) spaces labels in a fixed 1000-unit viewBox: at 55 names, 53 of 54 adjacent labels overlap (min gap −17.6 units); at 100, 97 of 98 — an unreadable band that reads as "cut off". Legibility bound ≈ n ≤ 37.
7. **Anonymous production is a dead husk — P0 acquisition defect.** All ten watchlist-page scripts (`watchlist.js`, `watchstore.js`, `risk_core.js`, …) return **HTTP 401** from the regwall (`app/deploy/Caddyfile` `@reg_asset` default-deny; the allowlist names `theme.js account.js …` but none of the watchlist bundle; `tier_preview.js` — the promised locked-slot painter — is never loaded by this page). Anonymous visitors get a publicly-cached (`max-age=60`) shell with a heading, a "?" and an export widget: **no cards, no empty state, no sign-in CTA, zero console errors because nothing runs**. The walled files are pure UI; the graded data (`stockdata/*.json`) is walled separately — so the wall buys nothing and costs the entire pre-signup funnel the handoff §6 wants. Terminal's anonymous `/portfolio`, by contrast, renders a proper benefits regwall.
8. **Latent large-list fragilities (code-verified; not the live trigger at 55/100 on a healthy network — all fixed in W2 regardless):**
   - `watchlist_risk.js:1353-1364` `decorateCards()` fires `SD.loadTicker(t)` for every card at once (5.65 MB at 55 names, ~10 MB at 100 — measured); `stockdata.js:132-140` caches failures as `null` **permanently** (no retry/TTL) and caches values, not in-flight promises (double-fetch race).
   - `market_books.js:195` persisted active-book filter silently shortens the list with no partial-filter disclosure (`watchlist.js:190,202`).
   - `viewItems()` sort is O(n²) (`watchlist.js:214`); order-missing tickers silently sort first.
   - `watchstore.js:146-149` selects with no `.range()` → silent PostgREST row-cap + corrupt `maxPos` watermark (`:156`) at scale.
   - localStorage quota failure (`watchlist.js:116-122`) keeps the in-memory blob → list vanishes on reload.
   - `scheduleDecorate()` rAF latch (`watchlist_risk.js:1529`) never fires in hidden tabs — background-tab loads render undecorated until focus.
   - (No deliberate cap exists: the only `.slice(0,12)` is the search dropdown.)
9. **Deploy split-brain trap for every JS wave.** The six page JS files are plain-copy template/site pairs (live in ~3 min via VPS pull, CI-guarded) but their `?v=N` stamps are **hand-written** in `watchlist.html.j2:867-878` and only reach production via a render — so a JS body can go live minutes-to-hours before its stamp, and `site/watchlist.html` itself can lag the `.j2`.
10. **Governance drift froze the wrong identity.** Three charters pinned watchlist-page primacy (UWP-R1 "evolution of watchlist.html", PSI §13.1 "stays watchlist.html — NO new page", Books §4 `#wl_auth` "(unchanged)") while `MASTER_PRODUCT_INFORMATION_ARCHITECTURE_V1.md` §10.4 held the page's identity OPEN for Sol/Chairman. Nobody owned the product story; every program added a correct layer to an incoherent whole — precisely the failure mode the CEO handoff names.
11. **Quality-tier debt on the honest-null path.** `portfolio.js:387-392` drawer swallows lane-render throws (`catch(e){}` → empty section, no honesty line); `risk_core.js` `factorBets()` uses diagonal-only variance (acknowledged approximation) so the patch-bay and the book read can name different dominant factors for the same ticker.

```

- One Portfolio (`portfolio_positions`); US/CN/HK/CA/Crypto market books are **derived views**, never separate portfolios or rows (handoff §1.2). A `portfolios`/`portfolio_id` schema is explicitly out of scope.
- Registered watchlists: full multi-list CRUD against `watchlists`/`watchlist_symbols` from BOTH products through one service contract per repo; no `.limit(1)`/first-list behavior anywhere.
- Local stores are demoted to: anonymous persistence, offline cache, optimistic UI, one-time migration source (handoff §13). They are never a peer authority for registered users.
- Watchlist and Portfolio operations never implicitly mutate each other (gates A–D).
- UWP-R2 (two-organisms) stands: user holdings never feed the signal path, boards, rankers, Neural Web, or alerts-authority; all joins are client-side display tier.
- UWP-R5 stands: any RLS/policy change ships as SQL in the same PR (`templates/uwp_supabase.sql` lineage).
- UWP-R6 stands: page never breaks logged-out or with Supabase unreachable; sync state disclosed quietly ("Saved / Saving… / Local to this browser / Offline").
- **Schema authority ruling (new):** the Terminal repo's `supabase/migrations/` chain becomes the single schema+RLS source of record for all three user-state tables. W1b adds an idempotent migration recording the already-live `portfolio_positions` DDL+RLS (column types verified against live PostgREST introspection first — never inferred); Macro `templates/uwp_supabase.sql` gains a pointer header and stops being an independent authority. Fixes the current split where `watchlists` DDL lives in Terminal, `portfolio_positions` RLS lives in Macro, and no repo holds the CREATE TABLEs.
- **Six-job nav reconciliation (new):** the IA doc's six-job model keeps Monitor (watchlist) and Portfolio as separate jobs. One page serves both jobs via its two modes: nav "Portfolio" → `watchlist.html` (Portfolio mode default), nav Monitor's watchlist entry → `watchlist.html#watchlists` (Watchlists mode deep link). No URL changes (N0-compatible); the two jobs stay distinct in nav while sharing one workspace shell. Flagged to Sol in §11 since this supersedes IA §10.4's two-option framing.
- **Drawer vs canonical-page law (new, per design packet):** the per-ticker drawer is an in-workspace composition of already-baked artifacts and ALWAYS links out to the canonical detail pages (`stocks/<T>.html`, Terminal chart deep link). It never becomes a second competing ticker-detail page, and its anonymous tier must not leak board-tier Prophet signal (design packet red-team BLOCKER #1 class) — locked slices reuse the `.mx-tier-gate` shell.
- **Notes/order sync decision (new):** `watchlist_symbols` has no note column; W1 adopts the `position` column as cross-product order authority, and notes remain a Macro-local feature disclosed as "this device" until a deliberate schema wave adds a note column. No silent schema additions ride this program.

## §4 Supabase / local-state migration plan

Principles (handoff §13): additive, idempotent, conflict-safe, owner-scoped; same name → merge symbols; local-only list → create server list; server-only list → keep; dedupe symbols; preserve order best-effort; migration marker only on success; run-twice test required.

**Phase 0 — verification before any migration code (W1 preflight):**
1. Confirm both products' runtime envs point at project `fsldfzlxyavsuwqbceod` (Macro `theme.js` sb-config ref; Terminal `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`).
2. Introspect live column types of `portfolio_positions` via PostgREST (the DDL was never committed; §1a) — the recorded migration must match reality byte-for-byte, not the UWP doc's memory of it.
3. Confirm live RLS on all three tables matches `0001_init.sql` + `uwp_supabase.sql` (owner-scoped, via-parent).

**Schema acts (Terminal repo, per §3 schema-authority ruling):**
- New migration `supabase/migrations/000X_portfolio_positions.sql`: `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.portfolio_positions (...verified live shape...)`, `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, and the four own-row policies copied verbatim from `templates/uwp_supabase.sql` (wrapped idempotently) — a no-op against live prod, but the schema finally has a home. Macro's `uwp_supabase.sql` gets a pointer header in the same program (W1a).
- No new tables, no `portfolios`/`portfolio_id`, no note column, no `watchlists.updated_at` — zero schema drift beyond recording reality.

**Macro local → server (W1a, evolving the shipped fold):**
- `mdash.watchlist.v1` fold (marker `mdash.watchstore.folded.v1`, skip-marking-on-empty — both behaviors kept) retargets from "the first list" to "the list named `'Watchlist'`" (created if absent). Same one-shot semantics; existing folded users are unaffected.
- Registered mode becomes per-list: cache keys `mdash.wl.<listId>.v1`; `mdash.watchlist.v1` remains the anonymous store unchanged (zero risk to signed-out users). `listId` enters `stateSig` and storage-event scoping per the UWP W2.5 checklist.
- The push diff (insert missing / delete absent) becomes strictly list-scoped: a delete may only ever target rows of the list currently being pushed — the full-membership diff must never see another list's rows. (Regression risk named in §11.)
- `mdash.pf.v1` → `portfolio_positions` fold: already shipped (`pf_folded.v1`); unchanged.

**Terminal local → server (W1b):**
- One-time additive migration on signed-in mount when `mm.wls.migrated.v1` marker is absent. For each non-`Default` local list: find server list by exact name → create if absent (`position` = max+1) → insert missing symbols preserving `section` and local order into `position`; dedupe by symbol. Never delete or rename server rows. Server-only lists are kept. `Default` keeps its existing reconcile semantics exactly (TRAP-1 mount-side and guest→signed-in transitions preserved as-is).
- Marker is a per-list success map; a partially-failed migration retries only the failed lists on next mount (idempotent by construction — merge-by-name + insert-missing).
- After migration, signed-in named lists are server-backed with `mm.wls` demoted to optimistic cache + guest store; `resolvePortfolioWatchlists`'s local-wins merge logic is retired from `/portfolio` (the page stops rendering watchlists at all in W5) and survives only as the guest-mode shell reconciler.
- Anonymous Terminal users keep `mm.wls` exactly as today.

**Collision rules (both repos, tested):** same name → merge symbols (dedupe; server `position` wins for existing rows, local-only rows append in local order); local-only list → create; server-only list → keep. Name comparison is exact (the schema's unique `(user_id,name)` is case-sensitive); no fuzzy matching.

**Tests:** run-twice-same-result (both repos); interleaved-writer test (Macro fold + Terminal migration on the same account converge without dupes); the §0 semantic invariants A–D run against the migrated state.

## §7 PR / wave sequence

| Wave | Repo | Scope | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|
| W0 (this PR) | macro | Census + commissioning packet + handoff committed; no production UI | — |
| W1a | macro | Canonical multi-watchlist registered store (`watchstore.js` seam, no first-list-only), per-list local keys, fold-in migration + run-twice tests; portfolio service seam exported cleanly | W0 |
| W1b | terminal | Canonical registered watchlist adapter; `mm.wls` custom-list migration (additive/idempotent); anonymous local preserved; drop first-list server behavior | W0 (parallel with W1a; contract agreed in W0) |
| W2 | macro | Flagship workspace shell: Portfolio ǀ Watchlists switch, holdings/watchlist dense tables, Account-Sync panel deleted → header save state, anonymous bulk-entry funnel. MOCKUP GATE before build; commissioning review before merge | W1a |
| W5 | terminal | `/portfolio` → `portfolio_positions` consumer; watchlist switcher removed from the page; live values; portfolio CRUD; Add-to split (Portfolio vs Watchlist); rail toggle | W1b (parallel with W2 — different repo/lane) |
| W3 | macro | Risk Center reorganization over existing engines (risk_core, factor model, stress lens, market books); Scenario Lab rehomed collapsed | W2 |
| W4 | macro | Per-ticker Intelligence Drawer composing portfolio_ctx v2 + stockdata + WRI + options + news + Company Intelligence + transmission + themes; honest tier degradation | W2 (enriched by W3) |
| W6 | both | Retention: change history, change-triggered digest, status alerts, “since your last visit”, Portfolio Brief v2; optional Health Score per DNR amendment | W2–W5 |

Discipline: one wave = one session = one reviewable PR per repo (macro PRs armed `merge-on-green`; terminal PRs follow that repo's delivery chain). No 10,000-line PR. Flagship UI waves return crops to the commissioning session before merge.

## §8 Files expected to change per wave

**W1a (macro):** `templates/watchstore.js` (multi-list CRUD, list-scoped push, per-list caches, fold retarget); `templates/watchlist.js` (parameterization seams only — `listId` in `stateSig`, storage-event scoping; no UI change); `templates/uwp_supabase.sql` (pointer header); `scripts/build_site.py` (add `watchstore.js`/`portfolio.js`/`market_books.js` to the asset-copy loop `:4744-4770`; fix stale `watchlist_supabase.sql` ref `:4735`); `config.yml:2828` (same stale ref); `WATCHLIST.md` (rewrite to current truth); node-shelled tests (multi-list CRUD isolation, fold idempotency ×2, list-scoped delete); paired `site/` copies via `python -m scripts.check_template_site_sync --fix`.

**W1b (terminal):** `supabase/migrations/000X_portfolio_positions.sql` (recorded DDL+RLS); new `terminal/lib/watchlists.ts` (canonical service: list CRUD incl. create/rename/delete server rows, symbol ops by list id); `terminal/app/api/watchlist/route.ts` (list-targeted actions; batched add parity; list CRUD); `terminal/components/TerminalShell.tsx` (server-backed signed-in lists + `mm.wls` migration + marker); `terminal/lib/portfolioWatchlists.ts` (reduce to guest shell reconciler); e2e: extend `watchlist-bulk-actions.spec.ts` coverage + new sync/migration spec; `terminal/lib/i18n.tsx` (new LEX keys).

**W2 (macro flagship shell):** `templates/watchlist.html.j2` (IA rebuild: two modes, header state chip, `#wl_auth` panel removed, dense tables markup, anonymous bulk entry); `templates/watchlist.js` (table renderer, modes, O(n²) sort fix, bulk-entry parser); `templates/stockdata.js` (bounded-concurrency fan-out + TTL'd negative cache — required for the W2 large-list gate); `templates/watchlist_risk.js` (`decorateCards` batching); `templates/portfolio.js` (cockpit composition + drawer honesty line on lane failure); `templates/watchstore.js` (save-state chip events); `templates/market_books.js` (book chips row); `?v=` bumps in the `.j2` for every touched JS; `app/deploy/Caddyfile` `@reg_asset` allowlist + `app/regwall.py` (cure the anonymous 401 husk — UI JS only, graded data stays walled; §2.7 — an operator-approvable slice of this may ship earlier as a hotfix); `mockups/refs/psi/workspace/` (mockup-gate crops committed BEFORE builder spawn); paired `site/` copies; zh copy in template and any builder-injected strings.

**W5 (terminal portfolio correction):** `terminal/app/(shell)/portfolio/page.tsx` (reads `portfolio_positions`); `terminal/components/PortfolioView.tsx` (positions table; watchlist switcher removed); new `terminal/app/api/portfolio/route.ts` (position CRUD) or direct RLS'd server-client writes matching the watchlist pattern; `terminal/components/PortfolioBriefPanel.tsx` (same-population binding note + disclosure line); `terminal/components/SearchModal.tsx` + `TerminalShell.tsx` ("Add to…" split: Portfolio modal vs watchlist picker; rail `[Portfolio|Watchlists]` toggle); e2e: new portfolio spec + `test:e2e:responsive`; LEX keys.

**W3 (macro risk center):** `templates/watchlist_risk.js` (tabbed Risk Center presentation; Scenario Lab rehome collapsed); `templates/risk_core.js` (no math changes; `factorBets` diagonal-only caveat surfaced or upgraded); `templates/watchlist.html.j2` (risk-center section swap); `templates/factor_exposure.js` (panel rehome).

**W4 (macro drawer):** `templates/portfolio.js` + `templates/watchlist_risk.js` (drawer shell composing ctx v2/stockdata/WRI/options-when-wired/news/CI/transmission/themes; tier degradation; canonical-page links; Terminal deep-link route verified, never guessed); `scripts/build_portfolio_ctx.py` only if a cheap missing field is required (default: no).

**W6 (retention):** `engine/portfolio_brief.py` (v2 fields per PSI §5.2); digest/alerts surfaces (`app/mailer.py` path per PSI §19.5); per-user sentinel decision (today operator-only); optional Health Score behind PSI §12 prereg.

## §9 New vs reused engines

**REUSED AS-IS (inventory verified against code, not doc claims):**
- `templates/risk_core.js` — all ten claimed capabilities confirmed present (factor betas, book variance, factor variance shares, idio risk, ENB, pairwise implied ρ, twin clusters at 0.70, per-position MCTR, calm/stress lens, coverage abstention >40% unmodeled) plus `whatIf` and `factorBets`.
- `templates/watchlist_risk.js` — nine per-name lanes (price/trend, stretch, events, estimates, balance sheet, selling/ownership, rate sensitivity, transmission chains, role ladder), `laneRows`/`chainRows`/`roleBadge` drawer helpers.
- `templates/portfolio.js` position drawer + CRUD UI; `templates/market_books.js` `marketOf()` derived views (already exactly the CEO's "books are views" law); `templates/factor_exposure.js` + `engine/factor_exposure.py` (`factor_betas.json`, `factor_cov_stress`); `scripts/build_portfolio_ctx.py` (ctx v1 live, v2 per PSI §5.1); `engine/portfolio_brief.py`; five per-market stock stores + `data_base.js` CDN rewrite; options plane, ticker news, Company Intelligence, transmission chains (drawer sources).
- Terminal: `TerminalShell` watchlist model + `SearchModal` add-to picker + `watchlistSelection.ts` bulk helpers (#405); `portfolioWatchlists.ts` merge logic (as the migration's reference semantics); `PortfolioBriefPanel` (rebound, not rebuilt); `SignupGate`; quote hub for live values; e2e responsive suite.
- Supabase substrate: `watchlists`/`watchlist_symbols` schema + RLS (`supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql`: owner policy + via-parent policy), `portfolio_positions` schema + RLS (`templates/uwp_supabase.sql`).

**MODIFIED (the seams — this is where W1 lives):**
- `templates/watchstore.js`: registered **multi-list** CRUD (retire `resolvePrimaryList()` soloism); widen sync beyond ticker-only (notes/order round-trip decision recorded in W1); clean exported portfolio service seam.
- `templates/watchlist.js`: UWP W2.5 parameterization checklist (per-list local keys, `listId` in `stateSig` + storage-event scoping, share-hash scoping); O(n²) sort fix; dense-table rendering.
- `templates/stockdata.js`: bounded-concurrency batched fan-out + TTL'd negative cache (kills root-cause 6a).
- Terminal `app/api/watchlist/route.ts`: named-list targeting (list id), batched `add` parity, server-side list create/rename/delete (today: none exists).
- Terminal `TerminalShell.tsx`: signed-in named lists become server-backed with `mm.wls` as optimistic cache + one-time additive migration; guest behavior unchanged.
- Terminal `/portfolio` page + `PortfolioView.tsx`: `portfolio_positions` consumer via the same RLS'd server-client pattern the page already uses for watchlists; watchlist switcher removed; plus a small positions CRUD route.
- Macro `/api/portfolio/brief`: adds explicit population disclosure (`mode: positions | watchlist_union`) so no consumer can ever silently mix populations again.

**NEW (small, composed — no new estimators):**
- Cross-repo watchlist/portfolio service contract doc + a Terminal migration recording the already-live `portfolio_positions` DDL idempotently (fixes the split schema authority; one source of truth going forward).
- Deterministic "What needs attention" stack (precedence rules over existing lane/risk outputs; no weights, no composite).
- Scenario Lab shell (rehomes existing `whatIf`); anonymous bulk-entry parser (paste list, optional weights); per-ticker Intelligence Drawer shell (composes existing artifacts; always links out to canonical detail pages).

**FORBIDDEN NEW:** optimizer/recommended sizing (WRI-R3 stands); new estimators (WRI-R2); `portfolios` table / `portfolio_id` (handoff §1.2); new token/header/card systems; LLM legs in any score (PSI §3.1.2); engine reads of user holdings (UWP-R2).

## §10 Acceptance matrix

§0 gates mapped per wave (W1: semantic invariants + sync + migration idempotency; W2: funnel + large-list + visual; W3: risk fixture + coverage; W4: drawer + tier degradation; W5: terminal population correction + CRUD isolation re-run; W6: retention flows). Full state table lives in §0.

## §11 Risks / collision check

**Collisions (checked 2026-08-12):**
- Macro: no open PRs and no sibling worktrees on this estate; ACTIVE_BUILD_MAP shows the two adjacent PSI lanes (#4897 market books, #4887 ctx v2) SHIPPED. CXI adjudication search: no conflicting rulings.
- Terminal: zero open PRs right now, but the estate is HOT — 15 watchlist PRs merged in ~5 weeks, two TODAY (#404 ext %, #405 bulk actions), and an uncommitted mobile-responsive overhaul is live in the shared checkout. Terminal waves MUST branch from fresh `origin/master` in an isolated `.claude/worktrees/` worktree (`claude/*` branch) and re-census `TerminalShell.tsx` at wave start.
- Operation Institutionalize: Sol is reconciling handoffs A–D into a Wave-1 decision packet. This program **supersedes IA §10.4** (watchlist identity) by direct CEO ruling and builds the Macro portfolio surface the IA doc deferred ("until a Macro-side portfolio surface earns its place"). The W0 PR body flags both so Sol's Wave-1 reconciliation ingests this resolution instead of colliding with it. If institutionalize PR-0 foundations (type ramp, `.empty-why`, display-tier stage field) have not landed when W2 starts, W2 composes existing `theme.css`/`.mx-tier-*` primitives and does NOT mint parallel ones.

**Product/design risks:**
- **P0 live defect found in W0 (§2.7):** anonymous `watchlist.html` is a dead husk — the regwall 401s the page's own UI bundle. Any fix touches entitlement policy (`Caddyfile` §"HTML documents are OPEN", operator 2026-08-04), so the cure is an operator-visible change: allowlist the pure-UI files (or load `tier_preview.js` on this page) while graded data stays walled. Chipped for an out-of-band hotfix decision; otherwise it lands with W2's funnel work. Until cured, every anonymous visitor sees a blank product.
- Drawer leak class (design packet red-team BLOCKER #1): anonymous drawer tiers must not expose board-tier Prophet signal; reuse `.mx-tier-gate` lock shells. Count-ladder signature is reserved to the Board archetype — the holdings tables must NOT borrow it.
- Day-change columns: Books spec v1.1 correctly omitted day % (index field `a` is alpha-z, not day change) and the `macro-quotes` Worker is dormant (billing decision). W2 ships Day columns as honest "—"/absent until a quotes decision; never fake it from stale fields.
- Terminal symbol aliasing gap: futures aliases (`GC=F` → `GC_F`) unsupported in the Terminal resolver; Macro syncs verbatim tickers → Terminal dash rows. Cross-product acceptance includes one such symbol.
- Supabase CN reachability (UWP §3 watch item): degrade-to-local must be genuinely silent in CN; the save-state chip is the only disclosure.
- Free-tier coherence: the brief is Pro-gated (matches handoff §19 paid tier), so free/anonymous KPIs on both surfaces must be computable client-side (risk_core over positions) — the page must feel real for free users without the brief.

**Engineering traps (named so wave builders inherit them):**
- Deploy split-brain: JS bodies are plain-copy pairs (live in ~3 min) but `?v=` stamps are hand-written in the `.j2` and wait for a render — every JS wave bumps stamps in the same PR and expects the two-speed window; `committee.html.j2` carries a stale `watchstore.js?v=2` to align or scope.
- `build_site.py` asset-copy loop omits `watchstore.js`/`portfolio.js`/`market_books.js` (they ship only as committed pairs) — W1a adds them for render self-heal consistency.
- Macro push is a full-membership diff that DELETES cloud rows absent locally — under multi-list it must be strictly list-scoped or a stale cache can wipe a sibling list (named regression test in W1a).
- Permanent negative ticker cache (`stockdata.js:132-140`) + unbatched 55–100-way fan-out is the load-dependent row-killer; fix ships in W2 with the large-list gate.
- Persisted `mdash.book.v1` filter silently shortens lists — W2 adds the partial-filter disclosure line ("Showing 12 of 55 — US book").
- `mm.wls` TRAP-1 semantics (mount-side reconcile + guest→signed-in overwrite) are load-bearing; the W1b migration preserves them exactly for `Default`.
- Terminal `watchlists` rows have no rename/delete anywhere → local renames have already diverged names from server rows; migration merges by exact name and never auto-deletes.
- `TERMINAL_E2E_FIXTURE` env flag drives deterministic e2e — new specs use it rather than live Supabase.
- Stale schema references (`config.yml:2828`, `build_site.py:4735`, `WATCHLIST.md:58` → nonexistent `watchlist_supabase.sql`) get fixed in W1a before they mislead a builder.
- "Portfolio" naming collision across the estate: Terminal Conviction Book (dies in W5), Macro `portfolio_brief.v1`, and the separate paper-trading Mastermind repo — copy and docs must never conflate them (cross-repo boundary audit 2026-08-11).

## §12 Explicit deletions / demotions from the current page

| Current element | Ruling |
|---|---|
| ACCOUNT SYNC panel | DELETED as a first-level panel → quiet header state chip + anonymous save CTA (handoff §3.8/§14) |
| PRE-TRADE CHECK in hero | DEMOTED → “Scenario Lab”, collapsed, inside Risk Center; engine (RiskCore.whatIf) retained; default sizing explained (§3.7/§15) |
| Giant factor/correlation patch-bay as page hero | DEMOTED → secondary visualization inside Risk Center Correlation tab, only if it aids comprehension (§8B) |
| Watchlist card wall as default layout | REPLACED → dense table default at 55–100 names; cards possible later as optional view (§9) |
| “Watchlist & Portfolio” mashed single-scroll identity | REPLACED → Portfolio ǀ Watchlists workspace switch; no duplicate content in one scroll (§5.1, §17.7) |
| Methodology-first hierarchy | INVERTED → holdings lead; diagnostics explain; no always-open methodology (§4, §17) |
| Raw internal vocabulary at glance tier (ENB/MCTR/WRI/lane) | DEMOTED → tooltips/method detail only (§17.8–9) |

## §13 Wave spawn prompts (commissioning template — gates travel INLINE, never by pointer)

Each wave session receives: (1) this packet's path + the CEO handoff path; (2) the §0 gate rows it must prove, restated inline; (3) the §8 file list; (4) the §11 traps for its repo; (5) the §14 amendments it implements. Builds route per Macro CLAUDE.md §Model routing (Opus `builder` builds; `designer` designs; commissioning session reviews — no self-merge on flagship UI).

**W1a prompt core (macro, Opus builder):** "Implement registered multi-watchlist in `templates/watchstore.js` + parameterization seams in `templates/watchlist.js` per packet §4/§8. NOT DONE UNLESS: semantic invariants A–D pass as node-shelled tests; fold retarget is idempotent (run-twice test); push deletes are provably list-scoped (test: two lists, stale cache of list A cannot delete rows of list B); anonymous behavior byte-identical (no UI change); `build_site.py` copy-loop + stale-ref fixes land; paired site/ copies ship byte-identical; zh untouched. Traps: full-diff delete (§11), fold markers skip-on-empty, `?v=` bump discipline."
**W1b prompt core (terminal, Opus builder):** "Create `terminal/lib/watchlists.ts` canonical service + list-targeted `/api/watchlist` + `mm.wls` one-time additive migration per packet §4. NOT DONE UNLESS: migration run-twice test yields identical server state; TRAP-1 Default semantics preserved (existing e2e green); server list create/rename/delete exists and is owner-scoped; guest mode untouched; `npm run test:e2e:responsive` green at 1440/820/390; migration marker is a per-list success map. Traps: never delete/rename server rows during migration; exact-name merge; `TERMINAL_E2E_FIXTURE` for determinism; branch fresh off `origin/master` in an isolated worktree."
**W2 (macro, designer → builder):** commissioned only after the MOCKUP GATE — the commissioning session produces light+dark+zh, desktop+390 mockups committed under `mockups/refs/psi/workspace/` and the design is pinned in the spawn prompt as exact markup/CSS. Gate rows: anonymous funnel, large-list 55/100 (incl. the §2.6 fan-out fix), visual matrix, save-state chip, Account-Sync deletion.
**W5 (terminal, Opus builder):** drafted at wave start against a fresh Terminal census; gate rows: `/portfolio` renders `portfolio_positions` only; switcher removed; brief panel population disclosure; CRUD isolation invariants re-run; responsive matrix.
**W3/W4/W6:** drafted at their wave starts from this packet's §7/§8 scope lines (W3 risk-center presentation over unchanged math; W4 drawer composition with tier honesty; W6 retention per PSI §19 seams).

## §14 Amendments to prior rulings (of record; predecessor docs stay in place with this packet as the newer authority)

- **A1 — UWP-R1 (placement) amended:** the URL stays `watchlist.html` (compatibility) and per-user state stays Supabase+RLS (unchanged), but the page identity becomes the two-mode "Portfolio Intelligence / Watchlists" workspace with holdings-first hierarchy. The one-scroll "unified dashboard" composition is superseded.
- **A2 — UWP W2.5 ("multi-list UI deferred") superseded:** multi-list registered watchlists are W1a scope; UWP's own preconditions (per-list localStorage keys, `listId` in `stateSig` + storage-event scoping, share-hash scoping) become the implementation checklist.
- **A3 — UWP W3 ("optional Terminal portfolio parity") superseded:** Terminal `/portfolio` reading `portfolio_positions` is REQUIRED (handoff §12.1) — W5.
- **A4 — WRI-R3 substance stands, placement superseded:** the what-if diagnostic stays descriptive-only (no optimizer, no sizing advice; the 2026-07-24 operator sign-off remains its display authorization), but it rehomes as "Scenario Lab", collapsed, inside the Risk Center (handoff §15). WRI's page-primacy premise ("revamp watchlist.html" as risk-first) is superseded by holdings-first IA.
- **A5 — PSI §13.1 ("stays watchlist.html — NO new page"):** survives as a no-new-URL rule; the page composition it froze is superseded. PSI §2's claims table is corrected of record: the "Terminal Portfolio page ✅ live" row described a watchlist-derived Conviction Book, not a portfolio; `portfolio_positions` has zero Terminal references (§1a).
- **A6 — PSI Books spec §4 `#wl_auth "(unchanged)"` superseded:** the Account Sync panel is deleted; the UWP-R6 disclosure obligation moves to the header save-state chip (Saved / Saving… / Local to this browser / Offline). The Books derived-view model itself (marketOf, FX-corruption guard, no cross-currency totals) is REAFFIRMED — it is the CEO's §1.2 law already implemented.
- **A7 — `MASTER_PRODUCT_INFORMATION_ARCHITECTURE_V1.md` §10.4 (watchlist identity, reserved to Sol/Chairman) resolved by the CEO handoff:** Watchlist = attention set, Portfolio = held positions, separate concepts, one canonical relational store each; the Macro page is authorized as the deep-analysis portfolio surface the IA doc had deferred. The six-job nav is honored via two nav entries → two modes of one URL (§3). PRODUCT_EXPERIENCE_CENSUS §1.4 "watchlist duality" closes the same way: Macro = deep analysis + acquisition, Terminal = live operations, one state.
- **A8 — Population disclosure law (new):** any surface composing the portfolio brief must state the population mode it received (`positions` vs `watchlist_union`), and equal-weight watchlist analysis is always labeled "Watchlist structure — equal weighted" (handoff §11.2). No consumer may silently mix populations again.

- **A9 — Anonymous-render ruling (new; W2 commissioning session, 2026-08-12).** Recorded verbatim:

  > The #5463 boundary stands: `stockdata.js`, `watchlist_risk.js`, `risk_core.js`, `factor_exposure.js` are NEVER served anonymously; no new anonymous server endpoints; never widen `config/site_access.yml` `public.exact` beyond the six shell files already registered (the frozen set in `tests/test_unsubscribe_page.py` is the review checkpoint — touching it beyond what this ruling licenses is a STOP-and-report).
  >
  > Anonymous ANALYZED state renders REAL structure analysis from plain arithmetic + shell-reachable public-plane facts: parsed book (names, weights as entered), weight concentration, market-book split, next events if reachable through the shell's own fetch paths; the Book Seam's MONEY rail renders real; the RISK rail renders as a locked preview shell.
  >
  > Everything factor-model/rule-derived (effective bets, risk shares, signal stages, attention chips, stress/correlation) = lock shells with the free CTA, using the mockup's "Free account" grammar.
  >
  > Anonymous hero: weight/sector-concentration phrasing ("Most of this book is one idea — big US technology" via public metadata, else weight-only concentration). "moves like about K bets" is RESERVED for signed-in (it is factor output).
  >
  > Signed-in users get the full pinned experience (risk trio loads as today for authenticated sessions).

  **As implemented (W2).** The boundary is unchanged: `public.exact` is untouched, the frozen `PUBLIC_EXACT` set is untouched, and no endpoint was added. The anonymous page boots without the four gated scripts, so `window.SD` / `RiskCore` / `WRI` / `FX` are simply absent and every read they would supply degrades individually.

  - **Real, from arithmetic alone:** the parsed book, the weights exactly as entered, weight concentration (top-N share vs an even split), and the market-book split — `MB.marketOf()` is a pure suffix derivation and needs no account. These drive the headline, the "because" line and the MONEY rail.
  - **Sector metadata proved NOT shell-reachable.** The ruling allows "via public metadata, else weight-only concentration"; the only source of a name's sector on this page is `stockdata/index.json`, which is gated. The build therefore takes the ruling's stated fallback — weight and market concentration — and the "big US technology" phrasing is signed-in only. Same for next events, which live in the per-ticker JSON: they render as an honest "—" with a Tier-2 cue, never a guess.
  - **Locked, with the free CTA:** the RISK rail (a dashed violet shell, not a fabricated distribution), every Signal cell, Risk share, Attention, and the whole Risk Center body.
  - **The effective-bets sentence is structurally unavailable anonymously** — it is composed in `portfolio.js` from a `bets` figure only `watchlist_risk.js` can publish, and that file never executes. Pinned by a gate assertion (`anonymous: the effective-bets claim is NOT made`).
  - **One inversion worth recording:** the seam's hatch means *this position is real money the risk model does not cover*. Drawing it for a book whose risk read is merely behind the wall told the visitor their entire book was outside the model. Anonymously the money rail is drawn solid and the LOCK is the rail below it — a different claim, made in a different place.
