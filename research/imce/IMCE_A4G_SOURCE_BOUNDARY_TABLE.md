# IMCE-A4G / A4P — Source / Boundary Table

**Wave:** A4G, updated by A4P (2026-08-21, ruling 6), updated by A4P.1 (2026-08-22, ruling R5). Records-only. No outcome number, model fit, or trial-ledger write appears anywhere below.
**Authority:** amended contract V1.2.1 §2/§4 (`IMCE_PREREGISTRATION_AND_EVALUATION_CONTRACT_V1.md`), as amended by `IMCE_A4G_AMENDMENT_LOG.md` (AG15, AG17, AG18, AP6, A4P.1 R5/R6).
**Purpose:** the mandatory Sol deliverable (d) — per-source rights + `pit_class` (closed enum) + vintage verdict, the PMMS HELD row, and the receipted macro boundary dates with source citations (or `not_yet_receipted` markers — never invented dates). **This is a living A4G/A4P/A4P.1 artifact, updated in place to the current law; every material change is logged in `IMCE_A4G_AMENDMENT_LOG.md`.**
**Primary source:** `research/imce/hb0/IMCE_HB0_SOURCE_PIT_VINTAGE_MATRIX.md` (17 series, 12 owning agencies, retrieved 2026-08-21) and `research/imce/IMCE_HB0_SOURCE_DEFINITION_CENSUS_V1.md` §7 (per-source vintage audit, SEC/Census/Freddie Mac/FHFA legs). **A4P adds:** WebSearch/WebFetch receipts gathered 2026-08-21 (this session) — §2 row 13 (Treasury), §6 (rewritten), §7 (new). **A4P.1 adds:** Treasury CMT storage/reuse disposition settled `GO_LIMITED` (§2 row 13, §4, §7) — Sol fourth-gate ruling R5, 2026-08-22.

## 1. `pit_class` — closed enum [AG15]

`pit_class` is closed at exactly three values, taken verbatim from `config/cycle_pattern/truth_schema.md`:

| `pit_class` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pit_pure` | All features computed from tape ≤ t; no revision risk |
| `revision_optimistic` | Some features use revised macro/regime data without ALFRED vintages |
| `mixed` | PIT-pure for the primary signal; revision-optimistic for regime features |

No fourth or fifth token may be minted for this family (AG15). A3 lane-1's own five-way `source_vintage_class` census vocabulary (`pit_pure`, `revision_optimistic`, `current_revised_only`, `prospective_from_capture`, `rights_blocked`) is a strictly more granular **local diagnostic**, retained below for its own analytic value, and crosswalked down to the closed enum per this fixed rule:

| `source_vintage_class` (census-local) | → `pit_class` (registered) | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `pit_pure` | `pit_pure` | identical meaning |
| `revision_optimistic` | `revision_optimistic` | identical meaning |
| `current_revised_only` | `revision_optimistic` | a strictly worse case of the same failure — no vintages at all, rather than incomplete ones |
| `prospective_from_capture` | `pit_pure` from the capture date forward only | before capture the leg does not exist — typed absence, never a back-filled `revision_optimistic` |
| `rights_blocked` | **no `pit_class` at all** | rights gate precedes vintage gate — an unusable source has no PIT question |

## 2. Macro/context source table

`V` = agency page opened directly (this session or, where noted, a prior cited HB0 session). `S` = search-summarized or not independently re-verified this session — a source claim pending verification, never treated as verified. **[M4 fix, A4G revision]** The `pit_class` column below carries ONLY a closed-enum token (`pit_pure` / `revision_optimistic` / `mixed`) or `—` (no registrable `pit_class` — rights-blocked, unverified-rights, held, or categorically excluded); all qualifying prose ("not usable until…", "once rights clear", etc.) has moved to the Notes column.

| # | Series | Owning agency (never FRED) | Rights verdict | `source_vintage_class` (local) | `pit_class` (registered) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Receipt now exists — see §7 for full detail.** Two build-worker sessions (A4G, A4P) attempted owner-direct verification via `WebFetch` — 6 total attempts across both, every one timed out (60s) against `home.treasury.gov`, ruling out incidental failure. **The commissioning (Fable) session independently obtained the receipt via direct browser access on 2026-08-21** — a real browser, not the build-worker's `WebFetch` tool — and reports the page content directly: page "Daily Treasury Rates — Daily Treasury Par Yield Curve Rates," `home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView?type=daily_treasury_yield_curve&field_tdr_date_value=2026`, stamped "Friday Aug 21, 2026," 161 daily entries for 2026, "Download CSV"/"View XML feed"/"Render XML" links, year selectors + a link to "Daily Treasury Archives" for pre-2023 rates. **Graded `V` on this attribution: "obtained by commissioning session via direct browser access 2026-08-21"** — distinct from, and not to be confused with, this build worker's own repeated tool-level failures. **Reuse/storage basis SETTLED: GO_LIMITED [A4P.1 R5, Sol fourth-gate ruling R5, 2026-08-22]** — Sol verbatim: *"Update the source-rights record: TREASURY_CMT = GO_LIMITED. Scope: internal research persistence/use of the Treasury-published Daily Treasury Par Yield Curve values with first-party Treasury provenance, retrieval timestamp, and methodology/source reference. Basis: Treasury is the publishing federal agency; 17 U.S.C. §§101/105 place U.S.-Government works prepared as official duties outside U.S. copyright protection. This does not grant rights to unrelated external/third-party content, linked datasets, or raw underlying third-party quotations. PMMS remains HELD. FRED/ALFRED remain excluded. NAR storage remains prohibited."* No persistent ingestion has occurred or occurs in this wave — GO_LIMITED authorizes a FUTURE ingestion design; a future ingestion-design session still designs and builds any `C_t`/`M_t` field stored on this series, within this scope. **A genuine construction-break receipt is also now on record** (§7): a methodology change on **2021-12-06** — monotone convex spline (MC) replaced the quasi-cubic Hermite spline (HS) method for deriving the official par yield curve; HS-era rates remain official for their own period — same disclosure class as PMMS's 2022-11-17 break (§4). |

**Tally — row-derivable directly from the table above [M4 fix]:** 20 total rows (17 numbered series + SEC EDGAR + DHI_IR/PEER_BUILDER_IR + FRED/ALFRED). `pit_class = pit_pure`: 4 rows (#13, #17, SEC EDGAR, DHI_IR/PEER_BUILDER_IR). `pit_class = revision_optimistic`: 8 rows (#1, #2, #3, #4, #11, #14, #15, #16). `pit_class = —` (no registrable `pit_class`): 8 rows (#5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #12, FRED/ALFRED) — of which rights-blocked: 3 (#5, #6, #12); not-licensed: 1 (#9); rights-unverified: 2 (#7, #8); HELD: 1 (#10); categorically excluded: 1 (FRED/ALFRED). `4 + 8 + 8 = 20` — identity check against the row total.

## 3. The one genuine upgrade path available (not executed)

Census NRS maintains a first-print press-release archive back to **January 1995** (`census.gov/construction/nrs/data/releases.html`) — each monthly release is itself the vintage artifact, reconstructing a genuine point-in-time series across the full 2005–2026 study window, no self-archival lane needed, no rights obstacle (public domain). **Disposition (unchanged by A4G, election E6 not executed):** NRS is declared `revision_optimistic` today, with a recorded, costed upgrade path to `pit_pure` via the release archive. A4 may register that upgrade as an explicit, scoped task; until executed, the `revision_optimistic` declaration and its disclosure obligation stand.

---

## 4. PMMS HELD row — detail

**Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey, 30-year fixed, is HELD [AG18].** Neither GO nor blocked by default.

- **PIT basis:** genuinely `pit_pure` in construction — weekly published rate, archived back to 1971 (`freddiemac.com/pmms/pmms_archives`, retrieved 2026-08-21), not revised after publication. **Registered `pit_class` today is `—`** (§2, M4 fix), not `pit_pure` — rights gate precedes vintage gate (§1 crosswalk), so a HELD source carries no registrable `pit_class` until its rights question resolves, even though its vintage properties are known and clean.
- **Rights tension:** the PMMS page condones attribution-only use, but the site-wide Terms of Use bar redistributing, publishing, or commercially exploiting "Data" without a separate written licence (`freddiemac.com/terms/`, retrieved 2026-08-21). The two statements are in tension and not resolved by this document.
- **Construction break, independent of the rights question:** PMMS underwent a methodology change on **2022-11-17** — survey-of-lenders methodology replaced by applications submitted to Freddie Mac's Loan Product Advisor (LPA); the fees/points and 5/1 ARM series were discontinued at the same date. [Freddie Mac Economic & Housing Research Note, `freddiemac.com/research/pdf/202210-Note-PMMS-12.pdf`, retrieved 2026-08-21; corroborated by National Mortgage Professional, `nationalmortgageprofessional.com/news/freddie-mac-updates-its-mortgage-rate-survey`, retrieved 2026-08-21.] Any cell pooling PMMS observations across 2022-11-17 pools two different measurement instruments under one series name — a construction break, distinct from and in addition to the vintage/rights question.
- **Interim primary rate leg:** Treasury constant-maturity yields (#13) — `pit_pure`, public domain, no known rights ambiguity, **`V`-grade receipt now on record [AP8, M6]**: the commissioning session obtained it via direct browser access 2026-08-21 (§7 full detail) after two build-worker sessions' `WebFetch` attempts (6 total) timed out against `home.treasury.gov`. PMMS here remains unresolved on RIGHTS (not availability); Treasury CMT is now resolved on availability/PIT-verification, and **its storage/reuse disposition is SETTLED: GO_LIMITED [A4P.1 R5, Sol fourth-gate ruling R5, 2026-08-22]** — see §2 row 13 for Sol's verbatim scope/basis. GO_LIMITED authorizes a FUTURE ingestion design; no persistent ingestion occurs in this or any prior IMCE wave.
- **Falsifier registered:** Freddie Mac's terms determined to permit internal research storage → PMMS becomes a confirmed `pit_pure` mortgage-rate leg back to 1971 (`IMCE_HB0_SOURCE_PIT_VINTAGE_MATRIX.md` §6, F-2).

---

## 5. No-NAR-storage rule — detail [AG18]

Verbatim from `nar.realtor` (retrieved 2026-08-21): *"No part of this data may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system, transmitted or redistributed in any form or by any means…without NAR's prior written consent."* "Stored in a retrieval system" is the operative phrase — this bars ingestion itself, the same way FRED's clause (q) does. A self-archival lane does **not** cure it: archiving is the prohibited act.

**Consequence:** the affordability construct is assembled from clean underlying-owner legs, never adopted from an off-the-shelf index:

| Leg | Clean source | `pit_class` |
|---|---|---|
| Price | Census NRS median/average price (#1) | `revision_optimistic`, upgradeable (§3) |
| Rate | U.S. Treasury CMT (#13) | `pit_pure`, `V`-grade receipt on record (§2/§7, AP8/M6) — storage/reuse disposition GO_LIMITED [A4P.1 R5] |
| Rate (mortgage-specific, optional refinement) | Freddie Mac PMMS (#10) | `pit_pure` in construction, but registered `pit_class` is `—` — HELD pending rights (§4) |
| Income | Census / BLS income series | public domain |

Never presented as "the affordability index" — it is a house construction, disclosed as such in every readout.

## 6. Macro block boundary receipt status [AG17, updated AP6, honesty-corrected AP8]

Per AG17, a block boundary used to partition an actual outcome run must carry a citation to a **dated macro-series or issuer-event source**, not a narrative news citation. The block list's year-level boundaries (contract §3 [A8]) and the A3 lane-2 proposed month-level boundaries (`IMCE_HB0_INDEPENDENT_BLOCK_LIST.md` §5) are recorded below with their current receipt status. **No date below is invented; every row is either receipted with a dated source or marked `not_yet_receipted`.**

**Boundaries remain honestly open — no receipt fabricated to make A4 green [A4P.1 R6, Sol fourth-gate ruling R6, 2026-08-22].** Sol verbatim: *"Do not fabricate boundary receipts to make A4 green. A4 registration is allowed with those receipts still open because the binding law is: no unreceipted boundary may be used to partition an outcome run. After registration, a boundary evidence wave may either: receipt the already-frozen v0 boundary from a lawful first-party source; or mark that block NOT_RECONSTRUCTABLE_FOR_V0_OUTCOME_PARTITION. It may not move a registered v0 boundary after inspecting outcomes. A scientifically necessary different boundary becomes a new preregistration/version."* Every row below that is `not_yet_receipted` stays exactly that — `month_boundaries_receipt_status: proposed_not_yet_receipted` (contract §3/§15a, YAML) is UNCHANGED by this wave. A4 registers with these receipts still open; only a FUTURE boundary-evidence wave resolves each one, to exactly one of the two named dispositions, never by moving a registered v0 boundary after outcome inspection.

**Ruling 6 status: PARTIALLY EXECUTED / OPEN, not satisfied [AP8, M6 fix — corrects the framing below and in
`IMCE_A4G_AMENDMENT_LOG.md`'s AP6 entry, which read as more complete than the underlying result].** The table
below carries **8 boundary rows** (GFC bust, GFC recovery, 2013 taper, the 2014–2019 grind, the 2018
air-pocket, the pandemic boom, the rate shock, and the affordability era). **Zero of the eight month-level
boundaries are receipted. None was changed** (no evidence found contradicted a proposed boundary — see the
per-row detail). **Two genuinely new dated, first-party, non-outcome receipts were obtained (NBER
peak/trough, one Fed press release — three citations, two events) and are recorded as bracketing context,
never as boundary redefinitions** — this is real progress on the surrounding evidentiary record, but it is
**not** the boundary receipting ruling 6 asked for, and this document does not claim otherwise. **Month-level
receipting for the remaining boundaries is escalated to Sol** (this wave's return packet GAPS) rather than
closed out here.

| Block | Proposed month boundary | Receipt status | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|
| GFC bust | 2006-01 → 2009-12 | **not_yet_receipted** | Narrative-sourced only (e.g. NAHB HMI "all-time low of 8 in January 2009" — a level statement inside the block, not a boundary-dating citation for 2006-01 or 2009-12 specifically). AP6 research pass did not target this block (deprioritized — GFC blocks carry zero N for all 6 registered cells under AP2). |
| GFC recovery / land-light era | 2010-01 → 2013-12 | **not_yet_receipted** | Narrative-sourced only ("recovery... at a steady-but-very-slow pace"). AP6 did not target this block (same deprioritization). |
| 2013 taper (sub-episode, zero N regardless) | 2013-05 → 2013-12 | **not_yet_receipted** | A dated macro fact exists nearby — "an almost one percentage point increase in the 30-year fixed mortgage rate between May and September of 2013" (St. Louis Fed blog post, `stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2017/march/housing-markets-face-taper-tantrum-moment`, retrieved 2026-08-21) — but this is a Fed Reserve Bank *blog* post citing a rate move, not a dated macro-series print pinned to the exact 2013-05/2013-12 boundary; and per AG7/AG17 this sub-episode's exact date does not need to be minted for N-accounting purposes regardless. |
| 2014–2019 grind, incl. 2018 air-pocket | 2014-01 → 2019-12 | **not_yet_receipted for the exact month boundary** | Narrative-sourced only (XHB ETF drawdown, builder-sentiment index level — **[AP8, n2] the "XHB ETF drawdown" phrasing here is itself narrative-only, not a receipt: an ETF price drawdown is issuer/market OUTCOME data, never citable as a boundary source under this contract's outcome-blindness rule even if it were dated precisely — it is retained only as descriptive color for readers, exactly like the builder-sentiment level statement beside it** — neither is a boundary-dating citation). AP6's research pass targeted this block (it is B≤3-contributing under AP2) but found no first-party, housing-specific, dated print pinned to 2014-01 or 2019-12 specifically — remains `not_yet_receipted`, honestly, rather than substituting a general-economy source. |
| 2018 air-pocket (sub-episode, zero N regardless) | 2018-07 → 2018-12 | **not_yet_receipted** | Same as above — narrative only; sub-episode status (AG7) makes the exact date immaterial to N-accounting. |
| 2020–2021 pandemic boom | 2020-03 → 2021-12 | **not_yet_receipted for the exact month boundary — but bracketed by 2 new `V`-grade first-party receipts [AP6]:** NBER Business Cycle Dating Committee, `nber.org` (owner page opened directly this session): peak in monthly U.S. economic activity **February 2020** (announced 2020-06-08, `nber.org/news/business-cycle-dating-committee-announcement-june-8-2020`, retrieved 2026-08-21); trough **April 2020** (announced 2021-07-19, `nber.org/news/business-cycle-dating-committee-announcement-july-19-2021`, retrieved 2026-08-21). **Scope discipline (unchanged from AG17/M4):** these are GENERAL U.S. business-cycle dates, not housing-sector-specific — housing did not bust during this recession, it boomed. Recorded as bracketing context only (the proposed 2020-03 start sits 1–2 months after the NBER peak/trough window) — **not** used to redefine the housing-specific boundary. A candidate housing-specific receipt (Freddie Mac PMMS record-low 30-year rate, 2.66% on 2020-12-24, `freddiemac.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/mortgage-rates-hit-record-low-yearend`) was found via `WebSearch` but returned **HTTP 403** on direct `WebFetch` — recorded `S`-grade (search-summarized only), and it is a level statement (a record low reached *within* the block) not a boundary-dating citation, consistent with the A4G table's existing treatment of the prior "2.7% in December 2020" narrative citation. |
| 2022–2023 rate shock / cancellation spike | 2022-01 → 2023-12 | **not_yet_receipted for the exact month boundary — but bracketed by 1 new `V`-grade first-party receipt [AP6]:** Federal Reserve, `federalreserve.gov` press release (owner page opened directly this session): **2022-03-16**, FOMC raised the federal funds target range to 0.25%–0.50% from 0–0.25%, "the first hike of the tightening cycle that began in 2022" (`federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220316a1.htm`, retrieved 2026-08-21). This is a monetary-policy action (first-party, non-outcome, dated), not a housing-sector print — it brackets the proposed 2022-01 start within ~2.5 months and directly corroborates the block's own name ("rate shock") but is **not** used to redefine the month boundary. Also unchanged from A4G: Freddie Mac PMMS's construction break, **2022-11-17** (`freddiemac.com/research/pdf/202210-Note-PMMS-12.pdf`, retrieved 2026-08-21) — a real dated source event inside this block, dating a mid-block methodology change, not the block's own start/end boundary. |
| 2024–2026 affordability era (`OPEN_ACCRUING`, zero N regardless) | 2024-01 → open | **not_yet_receipted for the start boundary** — **no end boundary exists (open, AG8).** A dated issuer event falls inside this block: LEN's Millrose spin-off, completed **2025-02-07** (LEN Form 8-K / press release, cited in `IMCE_HB0_SOURCE_DEFINITION_CENSUS_V1.md` §5a, retrieved 2026-08-21) — an issuer-structural event, not the block boundary. AP6 did not target this block (zero N regardless of receipt status, AG8). |

**Governing rule (AG17, unchanged; restated per AP6; corrected per AP8):** these issuer/source-structural and general-macro events are receipted and usable for their own stated purpose (structural-break flags, construction-break disclosure, general-cycle bracketing context). **None of them is asserted here as a receipt for a BLOCK boundary** — doing so would be exactly the M4-flagged circularity/narrative-substitution error this table exists to avoid, and using a general-economy date (NBER, FOMC) to redefine a housing-sector-specific boundary would repeat the same category of error in a new direction. Until a systematic, housing-sector-specific macro-series dating pass across all block boundaries is performed (lane-1 gap 11, still open after both the A4G and A4P research passes), every block boundary marked `not_yet_receipted` above stays so.

**Where an unreceipted boundary may be used to partition an outcome run — cited separately, not spliced [AP8, corrects an earlier composite-quote defect]:** three distinct contract clauses bear on this, and none of them may be quoted together as if continuous. (1) Contract §3, the paragraph introducing the frozen historical block list, states — about MONTH-level boundaries specifically — that a proposed-but-unreceipted month boundary is barred from partitioning "until it is receipted or the year-level boundary is used instead." (2) Contract §3's own AG17 paragraph states, generally, that a `not_yet_receipted` boundary "block[s] only an actual outcome partition on that boundary, not this contract's freeze" — i.e. it does not block registration/preregistration itself. (3) Contract §15/§15a's stop condition states, on its own wording, that "a `not_yet_receipted` boundary may not be used to partition an outcome run" — with **no exemption text for a year-level fallback written into that sentence itself.** **Honest reading (an inference this document draws, not a rule the contract states in one place):** the block-list table types each block's YEAR boundary as "frozen" and its MONTH boundary as "proposed... not yet receipted" — only the month boundary carries the `not_yet_receipted` status contract §15:416 refers to. Read that way, §15:416's bar reaches the month boundary, not the year boundary, consistent with §3's own month-specific permission. **This reconciliation is not spelled out as a single rule anywhere in the contract** — a future A4 registration session (or Sol) should confirm this reading before any actual outcome run relies on a year-level boundary in place of an unreceipted month boundary.

## 7. Treasury CSV/XML archive — receipt detail [AP6/AP8, rewritten — `V`-grade receipt now on record]

**Build-worker tool failures (A4G + A4P, for the record, not the operative receipt):** two build-worker sessions each attempted owner-direct verification via `WebFetch` against `home.treasury.gov` — 3 attempts each, 6 total, across the `TextView` query page, an `interest-rates-data-csv-archive` alias, and the `daily-treasury-rate-archives` index — **every single attempt timed out at 60 seconds.** This is a durable, reproducible finding about the `WebFetch` tool against this specific domain, not a one-off hiccup, but it is **not** what resolves this row — see below.

**The receipt: obtained by the commissioning session via direct browser access, 2026-08-21 [AP8, M6].** Unlike the build-worker's `WebFetch` tool (which times out against this domain), the commissioning (Fable) session loaded the page in a real browser and reports its content directly:

- **Owner:** U.S. Department of the Treasury.
- **Page:** "Daily Treasury Rates — Daily Treasury Par Yield Curve Rates."
- **URL:** `https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView?type=daily_treasury_yield_curve&field_tdr_date_value=2026`
- **Page stamp:** "Friday Aug 21, 2026."
- **Observed content:** 161 daily entries for calendar year 2026 (first row 01/02/2026 — e.g. 10 Yr = 4.19); "Download CSV," "View XML feed," and "Render XML" links; year selectors for 2026/2025/2024 plus "Current Month"; and the text "For daily rates prior to 2023, please View Daily Treasury Archives" (confirming archived historical files exist, addressing Sol's original commissioning assertion directly).
- **First-party methodology/construction-break note, also observed on the page:** a series break on **2021-12-06** — the monotone convex spline (MC) method replaced the quasi-cubic Hermite spline (HS) method for deriving the official par yield curve; rates from the HS era remain official for their own period. **This is recorded as a construction-break receipt, the same disclosure class as PMMS's 2022-11-17 methodology break (§4)** — any cell pooling Treasury CMT observations across 2021-12-06 pools two different curve-fitting methodologies under one series name. **[AP8, F8, for completeness]** This break date (2021-12-06) falls INSIDE the pandemic-boom block (2020-03→2021-12, §6) — its impact on the six registered v0 historical cells is **nil**: Treasury CMT is a candidate `C_t` context/rate leg only (§4–§5), never an `order_softness` construction input (that construction draws exclusively on net orders and cancellation rate, §1 of `IMCE_A4P_ORDER_SOFTNESS_STATE_CONSTRUCTION_V1.md`), so this break does not touch any registered cell's `M_t` basis.

**Attribution and grade:** this receipt is graded **`V`**, attributed exactly as "obtained by commissioning session via direct browser access 2026-08-21" — distinct from, and never to be conflated with, the build-worker sessions' own repeated `WebFetch` failures recorded above. This is the first `V`-grade receipt any session has produced for this row; the prior `S`-grade (search-summarized / Sol-attested-only) status is superseded.

**Storage/reuse basis — SETTLED: GO_LIMITED [A4P.1 R5, Sol fourth-gate ruling R5, 2026-08-22]**, superseding the prior "STILL explicitly NOT settled" framing: the receipt above resolves the *availability and PIT-vintage* question (CSV/XML export exists, archived files exist, a dated construction break is now on record); Sol's ruling separately settles the *rights disposition* question directly, without requiring an independent check of Treasury's terms-of-use page — Treasury is the publishing federal agency, and 17 U.S.C. §§101/105 place U.S.-Government works prepared as official duties outside U.S. copyright protection (Sol's verbatim ruling, quoted in full at §2 row 13). **GO_LIMITED's scope is internal research persistence/use of the Treasury-published Daily Treasury Par Yield Curve values with first-party Treasury provenance, retrieval timestamp, and methodology/source reference — it does not grant rights to unrelated external/third-party content, linked datasets, or raw underlying third-party quotations.** **No persistent ingestion of Treasury CMT data occurs in this wave or any prior IMCE wave.** GO_LIMITED authorizes a FUTURE ingestion-design session to build a `C_t`/`M_t` field stored on this series, within the settled scope — that design work is not performed here.

**This document authorizes nothing. No outcome partition has run on any boundary above. The next authorized act is actual A4 registration and, separately, the housing-sector-specific macro-series boundary-dating pass named in lane-1 gap 11 (still open after two research passes).**
