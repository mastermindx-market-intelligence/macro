# Winner Autopsy Lab — W4 Matched-Controls Fingerprint Study (Layer-3b)

**Status:** DESCRIPTIVE ONLY — no hypothesis registration, no verdicts, no filters, no site surfaces.
Rulings WA-R1 / WA-R5 / WA-R8. Spec: `research/winners/W4_CONTROLS_STUDY_SPEC.md`.
Question (Layer-3b): pre-onset, what separated eventual breakaway names from matched
controls sampled the SAME calendar day — the watchlist-formation question. Distinct
from W3 (`FINGERPRINT_CENSUS_W3.md`, WA-R8 null: winners ≈ blow-offs at onset).

**Substrate:** `winner_episodes.parquet` — manifest hash `c1a6a1cbec74a726`, harvest date `2026-07-07` (frozen; no re-harvest — spec §1).
**Run:** seed 20260722, n_boot 50,000, m=36 tests, α_Bonferroni = 0.05/36 = 0.001389.
**Estimator:** matched-set Δ = value(E,t0) − median(value(controls,t0)); month-block bootstrap with the matched set as the resampling atom (spec §4).
**Engine pin:** `engine/winner_autopsy.py` @ `e9324058fa0e2a1f138fad9eee025e0de5871261` (origin/main; control sets re-derived live by `sample_controls` — see Reproducibility).
**Wall time:** 410.3s

## Bottom line

Machine outputs — not adjudications. The main loop appends the ruling below.

**Two modest, genuine pre-onset participation signatures precede breakaway MOTION; nothing pre-onset separates QUALITY — consistent with the W3 null.** After the round-1 robustness grid (below, out of m), the honest reading of the primary (all_matured) contrast is:

- **`realized_vol_63d`** and **`updown_dollar_vol_ratio`** are the two clean separators — both survive gate-matching (α/m [8.77, 15.06] and [0.080, 0.181]) and both hold in `blow_off`. They are **motion-not-quality**: `updown_dollar_vol_ratio` FAILS in `kept_going`, so it marks *that a name breaks away*, not *whether the breakaway holds*.
- **`dollar_vol_z21`** and **`dv_5_60_ratio`** are **ONSET-BAR + GATE ARTIFACTS — NULL pre-onset** (same class as `excess_21d_pp`, not fingerprints): their round-0 separation collapses to NULL once the onset bar is excluded AND controls are gate-matched (α/m [-0.026, 0.374] and [-0.024, 0.136]). The episode median `dollar_vol_z21` is 1.99 at t0 but 0.67 at t0−1 — the elevation lives on the onset bar, and the detector's `dollar_vol_z21≥1 OR dv_5_60_ratio≥1.5` gate admits the episode partly *because* of it.
- **`drawdown_from_252d_high_at_t0m21`** is **SUGGESTIVE — Bonferroni-fragile**: its α/m CI flips to NULL under gate-matching ([-5.81, +0.093]), though the 95% ([-4.64, -1.17]) and cluster ([-4.64, -1.13]) CIs still exclude 0, and it does not mirror across the quality split. Not promotable on this evidence.
- Every 8-K density and RS-turn cell is NULL; `self_funded_at_t0` and `close_location_value` are UNTESTABLE (coverage).

Net: pre-onset t0 geometry marks *participation before a breakaway onset* (volume/vol elevation, a shallower drawdown), but nothing pre-onset cleanly separates the eventual *winners from the blow-offs* — the W3 null carries into the controls frame.

## Population & control pool

- Equity matured episodes considered: **1,213** (crypto segregated — see honesty section).
- Included (≥ 3 eligible controls, bars present): **591**
  - of which kept_going label: 75; blow_off label: 369
- Excluded — < 3 eligible controls: **622**
- Excluded — no bars for episode ticker: **0**
- Unmatured (equity, not in analysis): 1,387
- Crypto matured (excluded from primary): 23

**Control-pool size distribution** (per episode, over episodes actually sampled):

| n_sampled | min | p25 | median | mean | p75 | max | =20 (capped) | <3 (excluded) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1213 | 0 | 0.0 | 1.0 | 8.11 | 20.0 | 20 | 404 | 622 |

### What the excluded and included cohorts actually are (review round 1)

- The **622** episodes excluded for `< 3` controls are **602 (96.8%) sector-unmapped**: their `sector` is empty, and `sample_controls` returns zero controls by construction for an empty sector (an unmapped sector would match every other unmapped ticker — wrong cohort). So the exclusion is overwhelmingly a *sector-map coverage* artifact, not a market fact about those names.
- The **591** included episodes are therefore the **sector-mapped cohort**, and it is concentrated: **264/591 (45%) Information Technology**. Top sectors: Information Technology 264, Industrials 96, Health Care 91, Materials 50, Financials 34, Consumer Discretionary 29, Utilities 15, Communication Services 9.
- **179 distinct tickers** across the 591 included episodes (episodes repeat per ticker over time). Most-recurring: AMD (14), NVDA (14), WDC (14), LRCX (12), TER (11), XYZ (11). The ticker-cluster bootstrap CI (in every results table) is the guard against this recurrence inflating precision — it is printed alongside the month-block CI.

## Parity check (spec §3 — control-side implementation pinned to census definitions)

Episode-side recompute of `excess_21d_pp`, `dollar_vol_z21`, `dv_5_60_ratio` (via the `detect_episodes` code path: bench-aligned common index, value at t0) vs the committed parquet columns, tolerance 1e-06:

- Cells checked: **1,773**
- Pass: **1,773**
- Fail: **0**

**PASS** — recomputed trio is byte-for-value identical to the committed columns within tolerance. The one feature code path applied to controls matches the census's own definitions.

## Per-feature results (matched-set Δ)

Δ = median across episodes of [ value(E,t0) − median(value(controls,t0)) ] (continuous) or [ 1{E} − mean_j 1{C_j} ] (binary). Positive Δ = episode side higher.
CI95 = 95% month-block matched bootstrap; CIbonf = α/m percentile CI of the SAME draws (bonf_survives uses CIbonf, never CI95 — spec §0.1); CIcluster = ticker-cluster bootstrap robustness. `cov` = covered episodes / distinct t0 months.

## Robustness grid — the five round-0 SEPARATES, re-matched (OUT OF m)

**This is a robustness family, NOT part of the m=36 Bonferroni budget** (like the `gap_leg_crossed` stratum rerun below): the α/m column is printed for reference, but a NULL here *demotes* the round-0 primary verdict rather than earning a new test slot. The five features below are the ones whose primary (all_matured) α/m CI excluded 0 in round 0. We re-match under: **(a) gate-matched controls** — only controls that pass the detector's `dollar_vol_z21≥1 OR dv_5_60_ratio≥1.5` gate at t0 (episodes pass it for 100% by construction); **(b) t0−1** — read `dollar_vol_z21`/`dv_5_60_ratio` at the bar BEFORE onset, whose rolling windows exclude the onset volume spike; **(c) the combination.** Baseline (all controls, t0) is repeated per feature so the collapse is visible in one place.

Anchor diagnostics (all machine-recomputed, not pasted): control vol-gate-pass fraction at t0 = **2,693/9,813 = 27.4%** (episodes: 100% by construction); episode median `dollar_vol_z21` = **1.99 at t0** vs **0.67 at t0−1** — the volume elevation is an onset-bar phenomenon.

**Reading the grid:**

- `dollar_vol_z21` / `dv_5_60_ratio`: baseline SEP → **t0−1 + gate-matched NULL** (α/m CI contains 0). The separation was the onset-bar spike admitted by the volume gate — an **onset-bar + gate artifact**, same class as `excess_21d_pp`. Gate-matched alone or t0−1 alone still separates; it takes BOTH corrections to reveal the null, because either alone leaves one channel of the selection linkage intact.
- `realized_vol_63d` / `updown_dollar_vol_ratio`: **hold gate-matched** (α/m still excludes 0). Neither is in the volume-confirm gate, and neither is an onset-bar window feature, so gate-matching is the relevant robustness check — they pass it. These are the two genuine pre-onset separators (motion, per the quality-split table).
- `drawdown_from_252d_high_at_t0m21`: **α/m flips to NULL under gate-matching** (upper bound crosses 0), while the 95% and cluster CIs still exclude 0 — Bonferroni-fragile, not promotable.

## Contrast 2 / 3 vs Contrast 1 (motion vs quality)

Spec §2: if Contrasts 2/3 mirror Contrast 1 (expected under the W3 null), that is itself the finding — pre-onset structure predicts *motion* (any breakaway onset), not *quality* (kept_going vs blow_off).

**Contrasts 2/3 do NOT fully mirror Contrast 1** — at least one feature's bonf verdict differs across the quality split. See the differing rows above.

## excess_21d_pp — tautology disclosure (parity-only, NOT a fingerprint)

`excess_21d_pp` is the detector's primary selection variable (breakaway onset ≡ excess crossing ≥20pp, or 42d ≥25pp). Controls are sampled to NOT be in candidate state within ±21td of t0. Comparing episode-vs-control excess is therefore guaranteed-positive by construction — TAUTOLOGICAL (spec §3 exclusion / §0.2), not a market regularity. It is recomputed above only to pin the parity check; it earns no fingerprint slot and is excluded from m.

Descriptive (all matured, matched-set Δ, n=591): median Δ = 19.8100 pp (episode side higher by construction).

### Volume-confirm selection linkage (construction note, NOT an adjudication)

The detector's candidate condition is `liquid & rel_breakaway & new_high & vol_confirm`, where `vol_confirm = (dollar_vol_z21 ≥ 1) OR (dv_5_60_ratio ≥ 1.5)`. That gate holds for 100% of episodes by construction, while controls are NOT gated on volume (only on excess / candidate-state). So the SEPARATES verdicts on `dollar_vol_z21` and `dv_5_60_ratio` are SELECTION-LINKED in the same way `excess_21d_pp` is — an episode is admitted partly *because* one of these was elevated at t0. Read them as detector-gate echoes, not discovered fingerprints; the main-loop ruling should weigh them accordingly. `updown_dollar_vol_ratio` and `realized_vol_63d` are NOT in the candidate condition, so their separation is not a direct gate echo (though volume/vol elevation is correlated with the excess move that IS gated). **The robustness grid above now demonstrates this quantitatively:** `dollar_vol_z21` and `dv_5_60_ratio` go NULL once controls are gate-matched AND the onset bar is excluded (t0−1), while `updown_dollar_vol_ratio` and `realized_vol_63d` hold gate-matched — so the round-1 verdict demotes the two gate features to artifacts and keeps the other two as genuine (motion) separators.

## Honesty section

### Survivor-only (spec §0.5)

The census and its control pool are survivor-lean: the `survivorship_biased` column is an unpopulated constant (False), and no dead-name price source is present in this parquet's `price_source` (yahoo/massive only). No survivorship stratum is tested or claimed — the gap is stated, not resolved.

### Per-feature coverage (episode-side AND control-side)

| Feature | ep covered | ep total | ep % | ctrl covered | ctrl total | ctrl % |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| dollar_vol_z21 | 591 | 591 | 100% | 9793 | 9813 | 100% |

| self_funded_at_t0 | 254 | 591 | 43% | 0 | 9813 | 0% |

**NON-COMPARABLE:** `self_funded_at_t0` (B2 fundamentals) coverage is below 30% on at least one side — printed in the tables but must not be interpreted as representative. Control-side B2 is not joined at census scale here (statements panel + A2 firewall), so this feature is UNTESTABLE for the contrast.

### Excluded-episode counts

- < 3 eligible controls: 622
- no bars for episode ticker: 0
- crypto (7-day calendar + SPY benchmark category error): 23 matured
- unmatured (forward windows not closed): 1,387

### gap_leg_crossed == False stratum (Contrast 1 rerun) — robustness family, OUT OF m

Like the robustness grid above, this stratum rerun is a robustness family **outside the m=36 Bonferroni budget** — its α/m column is a reference tail, not an additional test slot. A change here re-weights confidence in the primary verdict; it does not add to m.

### What W4 cannot see

Per-ticker options positioning, analyst-revision breadth, and PIT short-interest are still forward-accruing (joins began ~2026-06 per the masterplan clock; first answerable ~2027-06). W4 tests only t0 price/volume geometry and trailing 8-K density — the substrates that exist today. A null here closes the tested constructions, not the search space (house epistemics: 'not found yet' ≠ 'does not exist').

### Reproducibility pin (review round 1)

- **Engine SHA:** `engine/winner_autopsy.py` @ `e9324058fa0e2a1f138fad9eee025e0de5871261` (origin/main, last commit touching that file — the read-only import surface).
- **Control sets are re-derived LIVE** by `sample_controls` at run time (deterministic: sorted, no RNG), NOT read from the committed parquet. The committed `n_controls` column **diverges from live sampling**: spot-checked on the first 40 included episodes, **11/40** differed. Consequently the committed-column inclusion count (`n_controls >= 3` = **585**) does not equal the live included count (**591**). Population counts in this report reproduce only at the pinned engine SHA (a later change to `sample_controls` would shift them).

### 8-K item-parser scope (review round 1)

This script's `_parse_items_list` is more permissive than the engine's (`engine/winner_autopsy.py:_parse_items_list`, a plain comma-split): the script also handles `[...]`-style list reprs (`ast.literal_eval`) and normalizes `;`→`,`. The committed `material_8k_events` store currently contains **zero** rows that would parse differently between the two (no `items` value starts with `[` or contains `;`), so on today's data the two produce identical output. The 'one feature code path' claim is therefore scoped to the current store contents — it is NOT a byte-identical reimplementation of the engine parser, and a future store row using bracket/semicolon syntax could diverge.

## Per-feature verdicts (SEPARATES / NULL / UNTESTABLE)

SEPARATES = α/m CI excludes 0 (mechanical, all-controls at t0); NULL = α/m CI contains 0 with adequate coverage; UNTESTABLE = insufficient coverage / degenerate (no CI) / NON-COMPARABLE. On the **primary (all_matured)** contrast, the round-1 relabel (`→ **…**`) is the honest verdict after the out-of-m robustness grid: the mechanical cell describes the round-0 all-controls-at-t0 fit; the relabel records whether it survives gate-matching / onset-bar exclusion.

## Adjudication (main loop)

Ruled 2026-07-22 by main-loop Fable, after an opus adversarial review whose own
recomputations (gate-matched controls; t0−1 onset-bar exclusion) drove the round-1
corrections, and a fix round that reproduced every review number in-script (zero CI
divergence).

**Ruling: NO registration.** The two clean separators are filed as **display-tier
descriptive census facts**, retained as confluence context:

- **`realized_vol_63d` (+11.6pts gate-matched, α/m-clean)** and
  **`updown_dollar_vol_ratio` (+0.13, α/m-clean)** are genuine, strictly-pre-onset
  participation signatures — but they precede breakaway **MOTION** (they hold for
  blow-offs; updown fails on the kept_going split), not quality. They are
  watchlist-context facts, not rankers. Any future attempt to promote either into a
  screen/ranker requires a fresh prereg AND must clear the **gate-matched t0−1 ruler
  established here** — the full-population t0 numbers are known-inflated and may not
  be cited as the effect size.
- **`dollar_vol_z21` / `dv_5_60_ratio` as PRE-onset fingerprints: REFUTED — onset-bar
  + selection-gate artifacts** (NULL at t0−1 gate-matched). The volume spike IS the
  breakout bar; 43% of episodes wouldn't pass the detector's own volume gate one day
  earlier. Registry row appended (DO_NOT_REBUILD §2).
- **`drawdown_from_252d_high` — SUGGESTIVE only** (95% + ticker-cluster CIs hold;
  α/m flips under gate-matching; non-mirror across the quality split). May be
  revisited only under a prereg with the same gate-matched ruler.

**Layer-3 is now complete: (a) census null on quality (W3), (b) two modest motion
signatures pre-onset (W4).** The combined read stands: nothing measurable today
identifies the future *winner* — not at onset, not before it. The discriminating
information, if it exists, is in the forward-accruing substrates (options/revisions,
first answerable ~2027-06) or in holding-policy conditioned on post-onset evidence
(the PSQ tilt lane, #3203). Scope caveats carried: sector-mapped cohort only (45%
IT), survivor-lean store, engine SHA pinned for control reproducibility.
