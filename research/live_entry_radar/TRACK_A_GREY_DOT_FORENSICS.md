# Track A — Grey Dot forensics & cross-repo parity (Live Entry Radar PR-0)

Read-only archaeology of the Terminal repo `/Users/chriswong/Documents/Cluade/charting-app`.
Every load-bearing claim carries a `file:line` receipt. `UNVERIFIED` marks anything inferred.

## §0. READ THIS FIRST — the checkout is a month stale

`charting-app`'s working tree is branch `claude/terminal-audit-fixes-20260713` @ `687da219`
(2026-07-13); the canonical tip is `origin/master` @ `82cb8cbf` (2026-08-13). The entire
amber-EARLY / bottom-watch / point-in-time layer landed in `935389d4` "Surface early bottom entries
and durable Prophet receipts (#392)" (2026-08-11) — **not in the working tree**
(`signal_layer/confluence_v2.py` 562 ln @HEAD vs 1211 ln @origin/master). Citations: `@om:N` = line
N of `git show origin/master:<path>`; `@HEAD:N` = the stale tree. **Anyone reading the checked-out
files is reading a superseded, leak-carrying G0.**

## §1. G0 — exact math, constant by constant

Entry `signal_layer/confluence_v2.py@om:643 early_dots()` → `@om:600 _early_dot_mask()`; input
frame from `signal_layer/confluence.py@om:240 compute_signals()`.

### 1.1 Bar construction

**3D bars — session-grouped, NOT calendar** (`confluence.py@om:146-163 _3d_groups`): sessions
numbered from the symbol's first listed session (`gi = arange(n) + bar_anchor`, `@om:156`); a bar
OPENS the session after any session whose global index `% 3 == 0` (`@om:159`) and CLOSES the
session before the next opens (`@om:161`). Bar value = **close of its last session**
(`@om:162-163`); the frame is **indexed by the bar's OPEN date** (TradingView's timestamp,
`@om:250-253`). Rationale `@om:166-179`: `resample("3B")` buckets by the Mon–Fri calendar and
"relocated ~80% of NVDA's signal dates" (`@om:44-45`). Needs ≥90 3D bars else empty (`@om:251`).

**2D bars — calendar, deliberately different from 3D** (`confluence_v2.py@om:620`):
`dc.resample("2B").last().dropna()` on the DAILY close — left-edge label, anchored to the first
daily row, empty buckets dropped. Availability is computed separately as the bucket's **last actual
session**, `dc.index.to_series().resample("2B").max()` (`@om:623`), `NaT` dropped (`@om:624-626`).
Partial in-progress buckets are not suppressed: a live half-bucket is usable the day it prints.
**Price source is CLOSE ONLY** — `s3` is built from `daily_close` (`confluence.py@om:250-253`);
"Every stream is **close-only-safe** (no intrabar OHLC required)" (`confluence_v2.py@om:26-27`).

### 1.2 Oscillators

Constants, one block (`confluence.py@om:57-64`): `RSI_LEN, FAST_LEN, BASE_LEN, SIG_LEN = 14, 14,
60, 5`; `STOCH_RSI_LEN, STOCH_LEN, SMOOTH_K, SMOOTH_D = 14, 14, 3, 3`; `OB, OS = 80, 20`;
`CONF_W = 8`.
* **RSI** (`@om:89-101`) — Wilder, `n=14`, on the **3D close series** `s3`; `_rma` (`@om:68-86`) is
  **SMA-seeded** (mean of first 14 valid) then recursive `α=1/n` (the header notes
  `ewm(alpha=1/n, adjust=True)` does NOT match Pine and flips near-threshold crosses, `@om:70-74`);
  mask `dn == 0 → 100.0` (`@om:101`).
* **StochRSI** (`@om:119-127`) — stochastic OF that RSI: `lo/hi = r.rolling(14).min()/.max()`
  (`@om:122-123`); `rawk = (r-lo)/(hi-lo)*100`, `(hi-lo)==0 → NaN` (`@om:124`);
  `k = rawk.rolling(3).mean()` (`@om:125`); `d = k.rolling(3).mean()` (`@om:126`).
  **NaN policy:** no `min_periods` override anywhere in the chain ⇒ pandas' default
  `min_periods = window` ⇒ `k` NaN until 14 valid RSI + 3, `d` until +3 more. `_early_dot_mask`
  hard-drops NaN rows (`dropna(subset=["macd","sig","k","d","rsi14"])`, `confluence_v2.py@om:611`)
  and bails if `len(rows) < CONF_W + 2` i.e. < 10 (`@om:612-613`).
* **RSI-MACD** (`@om:111-116`) — **MACD of the RSI, not of price**:
  `macd = ema(rsi(x,14),14) − ema(rsi(x,14),60)`, `sig = ema(macd,5)`; `ema` =
  `ewm(span, adjust=False)` (`@om:104-108`). The 12/26/9 `_f_macd` at `confluence_v2.py@om:392`
  is a *different* function used only by the recipe score — **G0 never touches it.**

### 1.3 The three legs (on the dropna'd 3D rows)
```
stoch_bull = crossover(k, d)                         # confluence_v2@om:616
from_os    = d.rolling(CONF_W).min() < OS            # confluence_v2@om:617
rising2    = (m2 - s2) > (m2 - s2).shift(1)          # confluence_v2@om:627-628
dot        = stoch_bull & from_os & mapped(rising2)  # confluence_v2@om:640
```

* **"Bullish cross"** = `crossover` (`confluence.py@om:130-131`):
  `(a > b) & (a.shift(1) <= b.shift(1))` — **strict `>` now, NON-strict `<=` prior.** K over D,
  one bar, no confirmation.
* **"From oversold"** = `d.rolling(8).min() < 20` — the **D line only** (never K, never both),
  strict `<`, threshold `OS = 20`, window `CONF_W = 8` **3D bars inclusive of the current bar**
  (≈24 sessions); default `min_periods=8` ⇒ first 7 rows False. Named as the oracle's
  `b1_from_os` primitive (`confluence_v2.py@om:649-650`), the same primitive gating the oracle's
  confirmed BUY (`confluence.py@om:283`).
* **"2D RSI-MACD histogram rising"** = `hist = macd − signal` on the 2B series, then
  `hist > hist.shift(1)` — **strictly greater, exactly ONE bar of lookback**, `.fillna(False)`
  (`confluence_v2.py@om:627-628`). No magnitude floor, no run-length, no sign requirement: the
  histogram may be deeply negative and still qualify.

### 1.4 Point-in-time availability (the `known_at` rule)

`compute_signals` now emits `known_ts` — "the session on which each bar's current value became
knowable" = the bar's CLOSE session (`confluence.py@om:242-243, 322-328`), whose comment states the
hazard: "For the live incomplete 3D bar this advances each session; a signal printed on Jul 28
inside a Jul 24-opened bar must not be presented as knowable on Jul 24." `_known_dates`
(`confluence_v2.py@om:590-597`) reads it with a fallback to the chart label. The 2D→3D join
(`confluence_v2.py@om:630-638`) relabels `rising2` by `known2` (each bucket's last actual session),
dedupes keeping last, then takes
`pos = rising_known.index.searchsorted(row_known, "right") - 1`, with `pos < 0 → False`.

**Rule in one sentence: a higher-timeframe bar becomes usable on the last real trading session
inside it, and each 3D row consumes only the newest 2D state whose availability date is ≤ that 3D
row's own `known_ts`.**

**The replaced bug is documented in-code** (`confluence_v2.py@om:603-606`): "The 2B resample label
is the LEFT edge of a pandas bucket, not the date on which the bucket's last price was observable.
Mapping that label directly onto a 3D bar lets a later 2B close leak backwards." The stale
checkout still carries the leaking form (`confluence_v2.py@HEAD:374`). Regression test:
`tests/test_bottom_watch_lane.py@om:53-55` — "A 2B bucket labelled Jan-13 closes Jan-14; Jan-13
must not see its rising hist."

**Residual PIT trap for Radar:** the emitted event `ts` is still the 3D bar's **OPEN** date
(`confluence_v2.py@om:653`), up to 2 sessions before its `known_ts` (measured: NVDA `2026-01-21`
→ `2026-01-23`; NFLX `2026-06-26` → `2026-06-30`). A consumer treating `ts` as the decision date
backdates the signal by 1–4 calendar days.

### 1.5 The ~4.6-day docstring, verbatim
`signal_layer/confluence_v2.py@om:644-651` (identical at `@HEAD:352-359`):
```
"""GRID_GATE anticipation form (a) — the EARLY pre-cross dot (~4.6d lead, hollow):

    3D StochRSI **bull cross from oversold**  AND  the 2D RSI-MACD histogram is
    **RISING** (pre-cross momentum).

"From oversold" = the 3D StochRSI D dipped below OS(20) within the last CONF_W bars
(the oracle's ``b1_from_os`` primitive). All math is the ORACLE's. Close-only-safe.
Returns the list of 3D-open-date strings on which the dot fires (chronological)."""
```

**The "4.6d" number is not sourced in the Terminal repo.** The nearest published figure is in the
Macro repo, where the detector is named `m2d_s3d_early`:
`research/signal_engine/CONFLUENCE_TUNING.md:105` gives **"+4.89 d"** under *"days earlier (mean)"*
vs the `base3d` confirmed buy at **coverage of base moves = 49.9%** — a matched-pair mean over the
~half of base moves it anticipates, **not** "every dot precedes a buy by 4.6 days".
`CHARTER.md:199` quotes the mechanism as "~5 trading days" and adds that acting on it early was
empirically WORSE entry quality (deeper drawdown). "~4.6d" is a paraphrase of a superseded
study — `UNVERIFIED` as stated.

## §2. Emitter / glyph trace

### 2.1 Event type and side channel
`build_v2` (`confluence_v2.py@om:1072`) is the sole emitter. At `@om:1170-1179`:
```python
bottom_watches = bottom_watch_events(sig, close, high=high, low=low)
promoted_dot_dates = {str(w.get("ts")) for w in bottom_watches if w.get("kind") == "early_dot"}
# A deep-washout anticipation dot now has a proper amber EARLY marker. Keeping the old
# gray side-channel dot underneath it would show one event twice and preserve the exact
# ambiguity this lane removes. Ordinary anticipation dots remain unchanged.
unpromoted_early_dots = [ts for ts in early_dots(sig, close) if ts not in promoted_dot_dates]
```

**That is the operator's comment, verbatim, at `signal_layer/confluence_v2.py@om:1174-1176`.**

Two emissions result. (i) `early_dots: [<YYYY-MM-DD>...]` — a bare **date-string side channel**,
last 40 (`@om:1201`, cap `SIDE_CHANNEL_CAP = 40` `@om:64`), re-capped to 40 in the doc
(`contracts.py@om:185,214`) and 12 in the model slice (`@om:642`); **no signal type, no price, no
quality** — not part of the unified signal stream. (ii) `bottom_watches: [...]` (`@om:1204`) →
`contracts.py@om:348-378` stamps `type="BOTTOM_WATCH"`, `scored=False`,
`subtype ∈ {early_dot, blocked_trigger}`. Schema `contracts/indicator.v1.schema.json@om:133`
enumerates `BOTTOM_WATCH`; `@om:231` "False on display/watch-only events"; `@om:238`
"anticipation-dot origin or raw blocked CB/revBuy origin"; `@om:260` the washout facts block.

### 2.2 Rendering (frontend = `terminal/`)

**Grey dot (ordinary, unpromoted)** — `terminal/components/ChartPanel.tsx@om:3845-3855`, gated by
`if (showDetailRef.current)` (the "Signals detail" chip, `@om:3845`):
`mk("circle", { cx: x, cy: y + 9, r: 2.2, fill: t2.mut })` inside `mk("g", { opacity: 0.55 })`
(`@om:3852-3853`). Circle, r = **2.2 px**, group opacity **0.55**, **9 px below the bar LOW**
(`y = yOf(b.l)`, `@om:3851`), fill `t2.mut` = CSS `--muted` = **`#717a8e`**
(`terminal/app/globals.css:9`). Bar-snapping in `resolveSideChannels` (`@om:2373-2379`); cleared on
non-daily TFs (`@om:7048`).

**Amber EARLY marker (washout-promoted)** — `ChartPanel.tsx@om:3538`:
`BOTTOM_WATCH: { dir: "up", fill: t2.signal, tc: "#231800", txt: "EARLY" }` — an **up-pointing
marker with the literal text label `EARLY`**, fill `t2.signal` = `--signal` = **`#e8b339`**
(`globals.css:14`). Verdict chip `@om:2462`: `v === "BOTTOM_WATCH" ? "EARLY"`.

### 2.3 Git history of the grey→amber change

`935389d4` (2026-08-11, PR #392) is the **only** commit introducing the promotion: touched
`confluence_v2.py` (+351), `contracts.py` (+105), `ChartPanel.tsx` (+100), `OracleDash.tsx` (+115),
`indicator.v1.schema.json` (+62), added `tests/test_bottom_watch_lane.py` (236 ln). Pickaxe
`git log --all -S"gray side"` returns exactly it and its pre-squash twin `02d302a3`. The grey-dot
render itself is unchanged since the `9ef273b4` VPS snapshot
(`git log -L 2182,2192:terminal/components/ChartPanel.tsx@HEAD`). Earlier "amber" commits
(`397700aa` #375, `07244dff` #376, `e152fd85` #378) are the **washout-override** ⊘/star classes — a
different lane, not the anticipation dot.

### 2.4 Does a grey dot still render today? YES
Only washout-context dots are promoted; every ordinary dot still emits into `early_dots` and still
paints the `#717a8e` circle. Measured (§2.6): NVDA 8 dots ≥2025 with **0** promotions; TSLA 10
dots, **0**; NFLX 11 dots with only **3** promoted. Grey remains the dominant form.

### 2.5 Verdict — "operator's grey dot == this event": **HIGH confidence**

It is the *only* grey/muted dot rendered by the chart's signal layer; positioned below the bar as
an anticipation mark distinct from the BUY ▲ (`@om:3846`); the in-code name for the class is
literally "the old **gray** side-channel dot" (`@om:1175`); and the description matches the
operator's. No competing grey marker exists in `ChartPanel.tsx`. Residual risk: he may be recalling
the pre-#392 rendering, so some remembered dots are now amber. Definitive confirmation needs the
operator naming one dated dot on one symbol, then checking that date against that symbol's
`early_dots` / `bottom_watches` — one lookup, no new code.

### 2.6 Fired dates — ACTUALLY RUN (2026-08-13)

No CLI or artifact emits these: `signal_layer`'s only `__main__` is `confluence.run()`
(`confluence.py@om:425-449`), which prints backtest tables, not dots; `web/mockup/data/NVDA.slice.json`
is a slim 2026-06-18 mockup with no `early_dots` key. Cheapest real path (≈40 s, no new tooling):
stage `git show origin/master:signal_layer/*` into a temp dir and call the shipped functions —
`compute_signals(pd.read_parquet(DATA/f"{t}.parquet")["close"].dropna())` → `early_dots(sig, c)`.
Store spans NVDA 1999-01-22→**2026-07-08**; `SIGNAL_ERA = gc_v2_wo2`; dates are **OPEN** dates.

| ticker | `early_dots` ≥2025-01-01 (all-history n) | `bottom_watches` ≥2025 (ts / known_ts / kind) |
|---|---|---|
| NVDA | 2025-01-17, 2025-03-12, 2025-09-11, 2025-09-29, 2025-12-02, 2025-12-18, 2026-01-21, 2026-07-07 (n=135) | none (n=27 all-history) |
| NFLX | 2025-01-17, 2025-03-17, 2025-04-10, 2025-08-04, 2025-11-05, 2025-12-23, 2026-02-06, 2026-02-25, 2026-05-18, 2026-06-09, 2026-06-26 (n=132) | 2026-02-06/02-10/early_dot · 2026-02-20/02-24/**blocked_trigger** · 2026-02-25/02-27/early_dot · 2026-06-26/06-30/early_dot (n=22) |
| TSLA | 2025-01-16, 2025-02-12, 2025-03-11, 2025-04-09, 2025-07-11, 2025-08-11, 2025-11-20, 2026-02-05, 2026-02-24, 2026-03-30 (n=80) | none (n=9) |

Empirical lead, dot → next `CB|revBuy` within 30 sessions: **mean 12.7 / median 12.0 sessions**
(n=190 across the three names). This does not refute "+4.89d" — that is a *matched-pair* mean at
49.9% coverage, while this charges every dot to the next buy at any distance — but **"~4.6d lead"
must not be quoted as the Radar's expected lead** without re-deriving under a declared matching
rule.

## §3. Bottom Watch lane (challenger C5)

`confluence_v2.py@om:686-716 washout_context()` + `@om:756-805 bottom_watch_events()`; frozen
constants `@om:72-77`. **Washout context = W1 ∧ (W2a ∨ W2b) ∧ W3**, on the dropna'd 3D rows
(`@om:696-705`):

| leg | definition | receipt |
|---|---|---|
| W1 | `sig["bear_block"]` — monthly RSI-MACD bear **and** below the 200-day MA **and** 2W RSI-MACD not bull | `confluence.py@om:315`; used `confluence_v2.py@om:704` |
| W2a | `close3 / close3.rolling(84, min_periods=20).max() − 1 ≤ −0.35` (84 3D bars ≈ 252 sessions) | `@om:73-74`, `@om:701` |
| W2b | prior-closed **monthly** StochRSI-D `< 20` for `≥ 3` consecutive months | `@om:75`, `@om:702`, dwell `@om:430-436` |
| W3 | `d.rolling(8, min_periods=1).min() < 20` — a 3D StochRSI-D oversold visit in the last 8 bars | `@om:76`, `@om:703` |

W3 uses `min_periods=1`, unlike G0's `from_os` (defaults to 8) — early history qualifies here but
not there. **Monthly PIT** (`@om:657-683`): `resample("ME").last()`, dwell `.shift(1)`
(prior-closed month), **relabelled by the bucket's last actual session** (`@om:669-672`), joined by
`searchsorted(row_known, "right")-1` — same discipline as §1.4, because "`resample('ME')` uses a
calendar month-end label that may not be a session" (`@om:661-663`).

**Emission** (`@om:774-804`): candidates = `(early_dot_mask | trig) & washed`, `trig = (CB|revBuy)
& washed` (`@om:715`). `trig` true → `kind="blocked_trigger"`, `quality="washout_trigger_watch"`
(the stronger subtype; it **de-duplicates** an anticipation dot on the same bar, `@om:765-766`);
else `kind="early_dot"`, `quality="washout_early_watch"`. Each event carries `ts`, `known_ts`,
`trigger_ts`, `trigger_known_ts`, `price`, **`scored: False`** (`@om:799`), and `washout_ctx` =
`"bear_block & (dd252<=-35% | monthly_os_dwell>=3) & recent_3d_os"` + `drawdown_252`,
`monthly_oversold_dwell`, `recent_3d_oversold` (`@om:785-790`). `_event_risk_metadata`
(`@om:719-753`) appends a PIT `sweep_low` (min low from 2 bars before the fire), `atr14`, an
ATR×0.5 `stop_level`, and `risk_basis ∈ {daily_ohlc_atr14, close_proxy_atr14}` — flagging when
close was substituted for absent OHLC. **Semantics: display/watch only** — "no position, alert or
backtest behavior changes" (`@om:766-767`), "it never weakens the classic `bear_block` entry rule"
(`@om:691`), and `contracts.py@om:541` keeps `BOTTOM_WATCH` out of the scored state.

## §4. Data plane and artifacts

* **Store:** `DATA = $MACRO_REPO/data/stocks/<SYM>.parquet` (`confluence.py@om:53-55`). **The
  Terminal signal layer reads the MACRO repo's OHLC store** — the two repos already share a data
  plane. 229 parquet files; columns `close, high, low, volume` **with no `open`** (verified by
  read), hence `bar_quality: "synthetic_open_deepstore"` (`contracts.py@HEAD:65`).
* **Vendor / adjustment:** Polygon daily aggs, Yahoo `period=max` preferred when deeper —
  "(split/div adjusted, back to IPO)" (`ingest/build_polygon_universe.py:34`; manifest
  `"source": "polygon"` `:117`). Spot-check NVDA 2024-06-05 close = 122.23 ⇒ **post-10:1-split
  adjusted**. Daily RTH bars; no extended-hours series reaches the signal layer. Local copy's last
  bar: **2026-07-08**.
* **Versioned artifact — YES.** `mastermind.indicator/v1` (`contracts.py@om:29`, schema
  `contracts/indicator.v1.schema.json`, 363 ln): top-level `early_dots` (`@om:214`), `warnings`,
  the unified `signals` stream including `BOTTOM_WATCH`, `state`, `meta.leakfree/score_basis`.
  Emitted per symbol as `<SYM>.slice.json` by `ingest/gen_slices_all.py` (broad universe) and
  `ingest/build_polygon_universe.py` (flagship ~37, with backtest).
* **spec_hash conventions already present:**
  `source_hash(src, params) = "sha256:" + sha256(src + "\x00" + json(params, sort_keys))`
  (`contracts.py@om:128-133`); `strategy_spec_hash(id, params) = sha256({id,params})[:8]`
  (`@om:135-141`, "so ingest can detect a LANE-STALE artifact"). Hashed params `FLAGSHIP_PARAMS`
  (`@HEAD:36-44`) = `{confW:8, rsiLen:14, useMTF:true, confirmTF:"1W", macd_on:"rsi", macd_fast:14,
  macd_slow:60, macd_signal:5, buy_rsi_max:65, ext_rsi:70, rev_bars:3, no_cut_exits:true}`. Second
  identity axis: `SIGNAL_ERA` (**`gc_v2_wo2`**, `signal_layer/__init__.py`), asserted in tests and
  stamped on every emission.
* **Fixture convention:** `tests/test_bottom_watch_lane.py@om:27-51` builds **synthetic** `sig`
  frames (`_frame(n)`), not recorded real-data goldens. A parity module exists —
  `signal_layer/golden_gate.py` (235 ln, "Golden-reference parity gate — INVERTED (audit #7)") —
  but its header warns its exported-vector gate reflects the **dashboard's** canon sequence, not
  this engine's. **No known-answer fixture for `early_dots` exists anywhere.**

**Cross-repo fork hazard (verified):** `Macro Dashboard/research/signal_engine/confluence.py` still
exists. Diffed against `origin/master:signal_layer/confluence.py`: **38 changed lines, all the
module header/`DATA` path plus the `known_ts` addition** — oscillator and 3D-bar math is
byte-identical, so the Terminal header's claim that it "has CORRECTED the math vs that copy"
(`confluence.py@om:31-35`) is **stale**. But the Macro copy has **zero** occurrences of `known_ts`,
so it cannot express §1.4's PIT rule, and there is no `confluence_v2.py` on the Macro side at all.
The `m2d_s3d_early` corpus in `research/signal_engine/` (`CONFLUENCE_TUNING.md`, `tuning_lead.py`,
`tuning_stops.py`, `TIERED_CASCADE.md`) all predates the PIT fix.

## §5. Known-answer fixture plan

Extractable today from the shared deep store with the shipped functions. Freeze each as
`{symbol, feed_end, expected_early_dots[], expected_bottom_watches[]}` + the `source_hash` and
`SIGNAL_ERA` it was cut under.

| # | ticker | window | asserts | why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | NVDA | full → 2026-07-08 | `early_dots` ≥2025 == the 8 dates in §2.6; `bottom_watches` == ∅ | baseline positive; pins the 3D session-grid phase (IPO 1999) + the empty-promotion path |
| F2 | NFLX | same | 11 dots ≥2025; the 4 watch events; emitter's `unpromoted_early_dots` **excludes** 2026-02-06 / 02-25 / 06-26 | only name with promotions — pins the de-dup rule of §2.1 in both directions |
| F3 | NFLX | same | `2026-02-20` has `kind == "blocked_trigger"` and is NOT in `early_dots` | pins stronger-subtype precedence (`@om:779-781`) |
| F4 | TSLA | same | 10 dots ≥2025; ∅ watches | shorter history (IPO 2010, 1344 3D rows) — catches `bar_anchor`/warm-up drift |
| F5 | all three | per-event | `known_ts` == §2.6 values (NVDA 2026-01-21→01-23; NFLX 2026-06-26→06-30) | the PIT contract; a reimplementation without `known_ts` fails loudly |
| F6 | any | truncate the daily feed to end at each dot's `ts`, before its `known_ts` | the dot must NOT be present | negative/leak test — the exact failure PR #392 fixed; the only case that would have caught it |

## §6. Parity strategy — recommendation

**Recommended: (a) consume the versioned Terminal artifact, with (c) as fallback under a locked
spec. Not (b).**

1. **The data plane is already shared.** The Terminal signal layer reads
   `$MACRO_REPO/data/stocks/*.parquet` (`confluence.py@om:53-55`) — Macro *produces* the bars G0
   consumes, so (a) has no data-coupling barrier and no vendor/adjustment reconciliation; the usual
   reason to prefer a reimplementation is absent.
2. **A versioned, hashed artifact already exists.** `mastermind.indicator/v1` carries `early_dots`
   + `BOTTOM_WATCH` with `known_ts`, `source_hash`, `SIGNAL_ERA` (§4). Macro consumes
   `<SYM>.slice.json` and pins on `(source_hash, SIGNAL_ERA)` — exactly what `strategy_spec_hash`
   was written for (`@om:137-139`).
3. **(b) is the worst option here.** `confluence_v2.py` is 1211 ln with a hard
   `from .washout_override import …` (`@om:41`, 1107 ln) pulling the whole override/ledger/era
   machinery; a "pure" extraction forks four files across two repos with no shared package boundary.
   The last attempt is the evidence: `research/signal_engine/confluence.py` drifted into a *silent*
   fork the Terminal header still mis-describes, missing `known_ts` entirely (§4).
4. **(c) is a fallback, not a co-equal.** If Radar needs a cadence the nightly slice lane cannot
   serve, reproduce G0 in Macro under a **locked spec** = §1 + §5 fixtures + a `spec_hash` computed
   the way `source_hash` is, gated by a parity test re-running F1–F6 against a freshly generated
   Terminal slice. Do **not** seed it from `research/signal_engine/confluence.py` (no PIT, no v2
   layer) or from the checked-out `charting-app` tree (§0: leaking 2D map).

Constraints observed: no installable package or version pin on either side; both repos bootstrap via
`sys.path.insert(0, ROOT)`; the store the slices are built from is **5 weeks stale (last bar
2026-07-08)**, so artifact consumption needs its own freshness gate; and `early_dots` is capped at
40 in the doc and 12 in the model slice (`@om:185, 642`), so a Radar needing deep history must read
the raw emission, not the model slice.

## §7. Other `signal_layer/` primitives — inventory only (OUT OF SCOPE for V1)

| module | ln | one-line (from its module docstring @origin/master) |
|---|---|---|
| `__init__.py` | 68 | "Signal layer — the TRUSTED math of the charting container"; holds `SIGNAL_ERA`. |
| `confluence.py` | 456 | The immutable oracle: Pine "RSI-MACD × StochRSI MTF" port on 3D + trade-level backtest. |
| `confluence_v2.py` | 1211 | GC v2 emitter — no-cut exits, graded recipe tier, keeper verdict, early dot, ARM/CONFIRM warns, bottom watch, reclaim lane. |
| `contracts.py` | 679 | The data contracts — builds `mastermind.indicator/v1` + `backtest_result/v1`; owns `source_hash`/`spec_hash`. |
| `backtest.py` | 271 | Tier-1 backtester; promotes `confluence.simulate` and adds the `backtest_result/v1` metrics. |
| `golden_gate.py` | 235 | Golden-reference parity gate (INVERTED, audit #7) — exported-vector comparison vs the dashboard canon. |
| `washout_override.py` | 1107 | Blocked-entry washout override: live entry gate, display stamp, forward ledger (era `gc_v2_wo1/wo2`). |
| `washout_lab.py` | 250 | Panel evaluation for the washout-reversal lane (`docs/PREREG_WASHOUT_REVERSAL.md`). |
| `reclaim_lab.py` | 159 | Panel evaluation for the RE-ENTRY repair lane (2026-07-15 rotation-miss directive). |
| `seasonal_regime.py` | 592 | Regime-aware forward seasonal-outlook engine from daily adjusted closes. |
| `regime_calendar.py` | 156 | Static macro-regime reference calendar 1970–2027 — the one curated-knowledge layer. |

Outside `signal_layer/`: `terminal/lib/signalVerdict.ts` (993 ln, verdict/soft-quality
classification consumed by `ChartPanel.tsx`); `terminal/lib/pine.ts` (flagship Pine source string,
`B1/S1` early vs `B2/S2` confirm grammar).
