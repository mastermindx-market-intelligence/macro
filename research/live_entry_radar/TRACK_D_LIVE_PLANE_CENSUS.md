# Track D — Live data plane + cadence census (Live Entry Radar PR-0 archaeology)

Census only, no design decisions. Macro checkout is **sparse** (`data/`, `site/`, `mockups/` absent
locally); existence/shape checks below use `git ls-tree -r HEAD -- <path>` (reads the tracked commit
tree regardless of the sparse cone). Mastermind (`/Users/chriswong/Documents/Cluade/Mastermind`) is a
full checkout, read-only. charting-app (Terminal) is out of scope/access — its facts are relayed from
the Macro masterplan's own citations, flagged inline. `UNVERIFIED` = not confirmed by a direct read
this session. No `gh` calls made (task constraint); any PR/CI state below is a static-file snapshot.

## 1. prophet-live architecture, element by element

**Backstop — `.github/workflows/prophet-live.yml`** (189/189 lines). Header (2-46): GitHub cron can't
carry the product cadence — measured 2026-07-30, `marketing-hot-tape.yml` (`*/5` RTH) fired 09:07Z
then 12:19Z (~3h12m apart); `live-quotes.yml` (`*/15`) ~90min apart — "not purchasable at any price"
with ~58 workflows in-repo. Three crons span 13:25Z-21:15Z for both DST regimes (48-67);
`live_states.in_window` trims the off-season edge. `permissions: contents: read` (79) + zero git steps
= G0.2 enforcement; `concurrency:{group: prophet-live, cancel-in-progress: false}` (81-88) never
overlaps or cancels in-flight. Gate (103): `PROPHET_LIVE_DISABLED != 'true' && (workflow_dispatch ||
VPS_LIVE_PRIMARY != 'true')` — kill switch always binds inside a host gate that self-disables once VPS
is primary. `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` (104), never the render pool; `pyyaml boto3` only, no pandas
(148); fetches the `live-data` branch's `quotes.json` to runner-local scratch, never staged (150-171);
runs `python -m scripts.prophet_live_evaluator` (173-189).

**VPS timer (the real product lane)** — `app/deploy/macro-live-prophet.{service,timer}` (48+28 lines,
both full). `ExecStart=...python -m scripts.prophet_live_evaluator` (`.service:35`). Resource caps
MEASURED 2026-07-30 vs. a 1,742-name pack + 2,025-symbol snapshot (`.service:11-25`): 0.006s wall/CPU
compute, ~95MB peak RSS; `MemoryHigh=256M`/`Max=512M` (~2.7x/~5x measured peak), `CPUQuota=60%`,
lowest `Nice`/`CPUWeight`/`IOWeight` tier (deliberately loses scheduling vs. the quote lanes it reads).
`OnCalendar=Mon..Fri *-*-* 13..21:03/5:00 UTC` (`.timer:20`) — `:03/5` not `:00/5` gives
`macro-live-snapshot` (fires `:00/5`, up to ~230s to publish) a 3-min head start.

**MACRO_LIVE_DIR ladder** — `engine/neuralweb/market_packet.py:86-106`, `_live_dir()`: (a)
`$MACRO_LIVE_DIR` override, else (b) `/var/lib/macro-live/public/live` if `.is_dir()`, else (c)
`root/site/live`. Shared by `scripts/notify_turn_events.py:122`, `app/main.py:99`. Runtime layout
(`docs/VPS_LIVE_ORCHESTRATION.md:76-96`): `/opt/macro` (code+canonical checkout) ·
`/opt/macro/site/live` (per-process staging) · `/var/lib/macro-live/public/live` (atomic-published
`/live/*`, Caddy `no-store`) · `/var/lib/macro-live/state` (locks/fingerprints/lane status/quote
cache) · `/var/lib/macro-live/data/intraday` (mutable VPS-only hourly bars).

**Event spool** — `engine/prophet_live/r2io.py:34`: `EVENTS_PREFIX = "live_flow/prophet_live_events"`;
`events_key(session,stamp)` (157) mints one R2 object per pass-with-a-transition. Confirmed live:
`R2_AND_DELIVERY_PLANE_TRUTH_CENSUS_2026-08.md:127-128` lists R2 keys
`live_flow/{prophet_live,prophet_marks}.json`, `prophet_live_armed.json`, `prophet_live_events/**` as
`PRIVATE_OPERATIONAL`. **No-intraday-ledger-writes enforcement** (three layers): workflow
`permissions: contents: read` + zero git steps; the VPS service also runs no git command; and
`prophet_live_evaluator.py:27-33` docstring law — "writes NOTHING under `data/`... outside the git
work-tree... never under `data/`."

**Nightly reconciliation entry point** — `scripts/reconcile_prophet_live.py` (1-38 read): `python -m
scripts.reconcile_prophet_live --nightly`. Turns the R2 event spool into
`data/prophet_live/forward.parquet` — "the ENTIRE evidence base" for the intraday-cross-vs-next-close-
fill hypothesis (joins session-correct `confirmed`, `next_close_fill`, first-cross dedup, one price
basis). "Sole writer... intraday lane writes R2 only" (32-34, G0.2/RUL-P10). **`git ls-tree -r HEAD --
data/prophet_live` returns zero tracked files**, and it is not gitignored — no `forward.parquet` has
ever been committed to `main`. UNVERIFIED whether the ledger has zero accrued rows yet, or accrual
awaits an unmerged PR.

**Measured/nominal cadence.** Nominal: every 5 min via the VPS timer, 13:00-21:59 UTC weekdays,
further gated to 09:25-16:15 ET (+grace) by `in_window()` (§6). GitHub backstop cannot hit 5 min
(measured 90min-3h12m gaps above) — a ~90-min rollback path only. Actual VPS production hit-rate vs.
nominal is UNVERIFIED from a static census (needs live `orchestrator_status.json`/sentinel state).

## 2. How live payloads reach users today

**VPS pull** — `app/deploy/update.sh:1-16`, installed as `macro-update`, **cron every 3 minutes**,
flock-serialized, pull-if-changed + `git reset --hard` + rsync `site/`→`site.served` (atomic rename).
Confirmed again at `app/main.py:565` ("the 3-min site pull, the 5-min live overlay").

**Caddy** (`app/deploy/Caddyfile`) serves `root * /opt/macro/site.served` (88). A short PUBLIC
allowlist of `/live/*.json` (`quotes.json`, `breadth.json`, `release_publications.json`,
`staleness.json`, `wires.json`, `intelligence.json` — 194,205-217,343,469) is served directly from
`/var/lib/macro-live/public`. **Everything else — including `prophet_live.json` — is NOT allowlisted**,
so it hits the `@reg_asset` matcher (341-346) and routes through `reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8000` →
`/api/regwall/check` → `/api/paywall/check` (347-361) before serving. Verified LIVE:
`research/R2_AND_DELIVERY_PLANE_TRUTH_CENSUS_2026-08.md:76` —
`www.mastermind-x.com/live/prophet_live.json` → **`401`, `no-store`**. **A new gated live path inherits
this for free by omission from the allowlist — no new gate code needed.** Server-side, `app/main.py:553-556`
`_live_artifact(name)` prefers `$MACRO_LIVE_DIR/name`, falls back to `SITE/live/name`; no dedicated
`prophet_live` route exists (`grep prophet_live app/main.py` empty) — served via the generic
gated-static path.

**Client precedent #1 — `templates/dashboard.html.j2:17920-19140`** (the direct template for this kind
of payload): `PLV_URL = 'live/prophet_live.json'` (17943); `PLV_EVERY = 120000` — "producer writes
every ~5 min, so 120s bounds staleness at ~2 min for ~2.5 GETs/artifact" (17944). Plain
`fetch(PLV_URL,{cache:'no-cache'})` (18583), visibility-gated after an unconditional first fetch,
`PLV_FLOOR=30000`ms floor on refetch (19129-19137) — one shared artifact, one poll, two panels.

**Client precedent #2 — `templates/live.js:1-60`** (of 573): `POLL = (LIVE_POLL_SEC || 60) * 1000` (41,
default 60s); 3 price sources in priority (Worker `/quotes` → static full-universe snapshot →
`live/overlay.json`); also opens `/ws/tape` directly for 6 macro instruments (57, §4).
`china_risk_state_live.js:29,232,243` mirrors the same 60s-poll pattern.

**Conclusion:** house idiom = one small gated JSON at `live/<name>.json` (atomic-rename into
`$MACRO_LIVE_DIR`, deliberately omitted from the Caddy allowlist), polled client-side every 60-120s
against a ~5-min producer cadence (2.5-5x poll:produce ratio is the norm), visibility-gated with an
unconditional first fetch. No new server route or poll framework needed — `dashboard.html.j2`'s
prophet-live block is a literal template.

## 3. Market data entitlements — the "Massive" vendor integration

Primary source: `research/MASSIVE_ADVANCED_INTEGRATION_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md` (894 lines;
§1,§1.1,§2,§3,§4.3,§5,§12 read). Massive = rebranded Polygon.io (PyPI now `massive` v2.8.x;
`polygon-api-client` frozen 1.16.3; hosts `api.massive.com`/`socket.massive.com` canonical,
`*.polygon.io` still honored — 234-238). Licensing resolved 2026-08-09 (Enterprise Market Data License
+ Redistribution Addendum executed, §0 gate CLOSED, 146-150).

**Entitlement verdicts** (TP-0 probe, `scripts/massive_entitlement_probe.py`, table 159-176, run
2026-08-08T11:44Z market closed):

| Capability | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Real-time trades/NBBO (REST) | entitled |
| WS stocks real-time `T.*`+`Q.*` | entitled (auth+subscribe only at probe time) |
| Second aggregates (`A.*`) | entitled |
| Tick history (`v3/trades`) | **20y+** (non-empty at 2015 and 2005) |
| Quote history (`v3/quotes`) | entitled; depth re-verified to **2005** (§12) |
| Snapshots + grouped daily | entitled |
| Short interest/volume REST | entitled |
| Options trades/WS/realtime | **not entitled** (403) |
| Indices (`v3/snapshot`, WS) | **not entitled** |

(Licensing record: `research/licenses/MASSIVE_ENTITLEMENT_RECORD.md`, not read this session.)

**Binding vendor facts** (§1.1, 196-238): **ONE simultaneous WebSocket connection per cluster per
product** on individual plans — "the single most architecture-shaping constraint." Delayed/real-time
are separate host endpoints; `Q.*` NBBO is Advanced-tier only. Flat files (S3): `day_aggs_v1` from
2006-03-15+, **`minute_aggs_v1` from ≥2010-06-15**; `trades_v1`/`quotes_v1` LIST-verified to
**2005-06**, 2024 `quotes_v1` at **~4.8GB/day gz market-wide** — "a blanket multi-year quote backfill
is TB-scale," so strategy is episode-windowed files + per-name REST, never a bulk crawl. **TP-0.5
measured** (§12, 2026-08-08~13:05Z): delayed/real-time **ARE separate WS buckets**, but **overflow
EVICTS THE OLDEST connection** — a full slot silently kills the incumbent rather than refusing the
newcomer (§3.1b.4, 381-399). Load-bearing for any future WS client: singleton discipline is
existential; a `1008 max_connections` near a reconnect signals a slot fight, not a benign retry.

**Current build state — NOT YET BUILT.** TP-1 (`engine/tick_plane/`, the WS-consuming daemon) depends
on TP-0.5, itself still "in progress" as of the last §12 entry (2026-08-08). Confirmed directly: `find
engine/tick_plane` → no such directory; `grep -rl "tick_plane\|ingestd"` → zero hits outside the
masterplan. **No persistent Massive/Polygon WebSocket consumer exists in this repo today.** `git
ls-tree -r HEAD -- data/massive` → only `capability_manifest.json` (the probe's output, not a data
store).

**Daily OHLCV, today** — `collectors/massive_stock_day.py:1-50`. Derived per-ticker
`data/massive_stock_day/<TICKER>.parquet` from `day_aggs_v1`, a **rolling ~5-year window**. R2 is
canonical (~617MB, ~20k parquets); git tracks only `_manifest.json`+`_backfill_state.json`.

**Intraday, today — HOURLY ONLY, not minute.** `scripts/build_polygon_intraday.py:1-70`:
`data/intraday/<T>.parquet`, explicitly **15-min delayed** (`DELAYED_MIN=15`, 63), curated universe,
powers only the 4H chart timeframe. Gitignored (`.gitignore:66`). Distinct from the VPS-side, mutable,
also-hourly `/var/lib/macro-live/data/intraday` — same name, two stores; do not conflate.

**Minute-bar historical store — DOES NOT EXIST.** Entitlement is proven deep (minute flat files to
2010, tick history to 2005), but no code turns that into a durable, queryable minute-bar store — that
is unbuilt wave **TP-B** (§5). The nearest existing thing — hourly, 15-min-delayed, curated-universe
`data/intraday/*.parquet` — is the wrong grain, latency, and universe for a minute-bar replay
substrate.

**Sizing anchors for the Radar's ~500-1500-name Probe Set** (comparators, not requirements): masterplan
§3.2 Tier-A pilot caps the planned tick-plane capture at a **hard 600 symbols**. Nightly `prophet_live`
*arming* probes ~1,730 names in 420s wall-clock on 4 workers/4 cores; `max_probe: 500` starved the pass
to `armed_n=0` (`config.yml:699-724`). The simplest live loop (`live: max_universe: 150`, 617,
`poll_seconds: 60`) caps well below the Radar's target — a Radar at 500-1,500 names/5min sits between
these two existing lanes in both size and per-name compute weight.

## 4. Existing WebSocket/stream owners

**Macro — `app/tape.py:1-80`**: `TapeHub`, one process-wide task, connects to
**`wss://streamer.finance.yahoo.com`** (Yahoo unofficial — NOT Massive/Polygon), 6 symbols (ES=F, NQ=F,
YM=F, RTY=F, ^TNX, DX-Y.NYB per `live.js:57`), fans out over same-origin `GET /ws/tape`
(`Caddyfile:146`). "No browser talks to the unofficial upstream directly... one shared upstream
connection" (6-9) — different vendor, different socket, no competition for the Massive slot. **The
Massive/Polygon stocks WebSocket is UNOWNED in Macro**: no process connects to
`socket.polygon.io/stocks` or `socket.massive.com` today; TP-1 is unbuilt (§3);
`massive_entitlement_probe.py` opens only a transient probe connection.

**Terminal's Quote Hub (charting-app, out of scope — relayed from the Macro masterplan, UNVERIFIED
independently):** §2.1/§3.1b name `hub/lib/polygon.js` as the second candidate client, today
subscribing `AM.*` on the delayed cluster with auto-demote-to-delayed. Recorded (not yet exercised)
law: once built, TP-1 is sole owner of the real-time cluster; the hub migrates to TP-1's derived stream
later — and since TP-0.5 showed delayed/real-time are separate buckets, that migration does NOT fold
into TP-1 automatically.

**Mastermind — verified directly, `data_layer/polygon.py:1-90`** (canonical checkout): REST-only,
`grep -n -i websocket` → zero hits. Thin wrapper over `collectors.polygon_options.PolygonOptions` (the
same vendored Macro client via a `bot` sys.path shim); key resolves `POLYGON_API_KEY` falling back to
`MASSIVE_API_KEY` — Mastermind reuses Macro's key/client, holds no credential of its own. "Delayed data
is fine here: this is a paper book" (1-12), 60s TTL cache. Repo-wide grep surfaced only this file.

**Net answer:** zero processes hold a live Massive/Polygon stocks WebSocket open anywhere in Macro or
Mastermind today. The single-connection slot is unclaimed. A REST-based Radar (unlimited-call, ~<100
req/s soft ceiling — already every daily/hourly collector's pattern) needs none of the §3.1b
singleton-discipline machinery; only a WS-based design would.

## 5. Breathing Platform program

Source: `research/BREATHING_PLATFORM_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md` (406 lines, §3/§4 read) +
`...CONTINUATION_HANDOFF_2026-08-10_SESSION4.md` (221/221 — most recent Breathing-Platform doc found;
no newer handoff exists).

**Three cadences, one engine** (§3, 240-263): (1) **Authority** (nightly, shrinking) — ledgers,
grading, pack re-arming, full render; (2) **Provisional close-pass** (new, ~16:15-17:30 ET) — mac-side
pass recomputing admission + price-derived score legs from the day's closes, publishing "tonight's
picks, pending nightly confirmation" (evening-SLA fix: ~18:30 ET vs. ~11pm-1am ET); (3) **Breathing
lane** (existing, ~5min RTH) — append-semantics crossing states, partial live rescore (signal 30 +
runway 10 pts), risk badges, 2-pass-debounce alerts. "Provisional never touches `data/`" (261) — same
G0.2 law as prophet-live. **For a 5-min Radar:** cadence (2) is ~once/session, not directly reusable;
cadence (3) is the closer analog (5-min RTH, partial rescore) but scoped to the nightly-armed
universe's specific signal/runway legs — a sibling pattern to copy, not infrastructure to plug into.

**Status as of SESSION4 (2026-08-10):** four PRs (#5217/#5220/#5222/#5223, payload/receipt/SLA/
renderer) built+reviewed, disarmed mid-session by an unrelated repair, meant to re-arm as one wave.
**"The evening lane has NEVER RUN... `close-pass.yml`'s `publish` job has never fired... both FAILED
with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas'`"** — invisible for a day (read downstream as
absent data, not a fault); fixed incidentally by #5220. **W-L1's gate needs five consecutive green
sessions, which "cannot be built; it accrues"** — unproven end-to-end as of that doc.

**Fresher in-repo signal (today):** `close-pass.yml`'s header carries a **"CORRECTED 2026-08-13"**
note: the lane "has never been green" until a `git checkout -- .` discard step was added beside
`--heal` — i.e. the pandas/discard defect reads as addressed today, though no `gh` call confirmed
current CI/merge state this session. **Read status as: architecture ratified and mostly built; W-L1
not proven green end-to-end as of the last narrative doc, with today's comment suggesting the known
defect is fixed. Treat "is W-L1 live" as OPEN.**

**Evening render cadence** (`closing-bell.yml`): fires **16:05 ET** both DST regimes (68-69) — "Build
A," full provisional EOD render, non-ledger, EXCLUDES `build_prophet`/`grade_us_board`/`us_pages`.
Measured 109min behind an 81min spine, lands ~17:55 ET vs. an 18:30 SLA (35min margin) — why the
provisional board is a separate lane. `close-pass.yml` fires **16:25 ET** both regimes, separate
concurrency group, straight to R2→VPS (not through a render), landing ~30min after close regardless of
the render spine.

**Asia-close cadence** (`asia-close.yml`): 7-slot schedule (06:00-11:15 UTC) racing to be first because
GitHub fires this repo's schedules 86-233min late (measured); early-bird slots gated at an 08:25 UTC
data floor (HK auction ~08:10 UTC=16:10 HKT; mainland EOD ~08:00-08:30 UTC) so net start ≈ the close.

## 6. Session calendar in live lanes

Exact module: **`lib/nyse_calendar.py`**, via `engine/prophet_live/live_states.py:386-414`
`in_window()`. ET wall clock via `ZoneInfo("America/New_York")` (239); weekday check; then `from
lib.nyse_calendar import is_session; if not is_session(t.date()): return False` (398-401) — the
holiday-aware check, so the lane stands down on Thanksgiving etc. **Fail-soft**: an exception degrades
to weekday-only (402-403), never blocks the pass. Window bounds from config (`window_et` default
09:25/16:15) plus `window_grace_min` (default 10) at the end (404-411). Same module backs
`last_completed_session()` (425-431, `expected_last_session`) — pack `as_of` must equal this date
exactly or the artifact ships `stale_pack`. Why the two-layer design: "systemd calendars have no ET"
(`macro-live-prophet.timer:1-10`) — the timer's `OnCalendar` spans a UTC range covering both DST
regimes, and `in_window()` is the only thing that knows what "9:25 ET" means on a given day. Same
module anchors `macro-sentinel` (`VPS_LIVE_ORCHESTRATION.md:161`) and `closing-bell.yml`.

---

## 7. Recent hardening context (pointers only)

All three OPEN per `docs/ACTIVE_BUILD_MAP.md` (generated 2026-08-14T03:07:03Z; no `gh` calls made,
snapshot only):

- **#5555** — `prophet: stale-frame action safety — no current instruction off a dead tape`
  (`engine/prophet_management.py`, `build_prophet.py`). Not yet on `main` (`grep stale
  engine/prophet_management.py` → no hits). Implication: gate the *action* surface on frame freshness
  separately from the display — a Radar entry signal needs the same discipline (never emit a live
  "enter now" off a stale/dead-tape frame).
- **#5571** — `ops(prophet-us): availability hardening — bounded self-heal rescue lane + resilience
  layers` (mostly CI plumbing). Implication: an idiom already exists for "the nightly bake died,
  self-heal within a bound" that a new live lane should register with, not reinvent.
- **#5487** — `ops: nightly-liveness dead-man switch — the US bake went dark for two sessions and
  nothing reported it`. Implication: silence is the default failure mode here (this outage and the
  Breathing Platform's pandas failure, §5, both went undetected until named) — a new 5-min lane MUST
  register a positive liveness signal (content-advanced, not process-exited-0) with
  `macro-sentinel`/`freshness_sentinel.py`.
