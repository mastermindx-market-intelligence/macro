# TOPA AM-v2 Preregistration — Anchor-Distribution-Matched Controls (`top_anatomy_p1`, instrument v2)

Program: Top Anatomy (`research/TOP_ANATOMY_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md`; docket L1, display tier,
AVOID-not-SHORT permanently — `DNR:KILL-DIRECTIONAL-SHORTING`). This document is FROZEN before any
AM-v2 number exists; its §7 log is append-only (corrections are new entries, never edits).

Charter: `reports/top-anatomy-phase1.md` §7.1 — AM-v2 is MANDATORY before any ore-body conclusion
hardens in either direction. Phase-1's AM-v1 instrument REVERSED the asymmetry it was built to
remove (controls pinned at `days_since_63d_high == 0` while the frozen {21,10,5} snapshots put
case anchors at median 2.0/1.0/2.0, mean 6.99/3.92/5.64), a magnitude-only boolean blessed the
reversal, and nine cells were voided only by adjudicator override. AM-v2 exists to replace that
discretion with an instrument: controls matched to the case anchor DISTRIBUTION, control
episode-age asymmetry stratified, snapshot geometry stated correctly, and a SIGNED validity rule
that GOVERNS with a pre-registered escalation — so no override can be needed, whichever way it
falls.

## §0 The question

Is the wrong-sign ore body (topped episodes at their measured snapshots look *younger, fresher-high,
faster-heating* than matched surviving extension episodes) **anatomy**, or **anchor geometry** —
the mechanical consequence of measuring cases near their own 63d highs? Phase-1's DM arm already
discharged duration/length-bias for B2 and F3 where floors clear and located B3-primary's kill in
the sampling half. AM-v2 closes the remaining measured counter-explanation: anchor proximity.

## §1 The moved variable: anchor caliper on the frozen pairing granularity

The frozen matcher pairs **per case snapshot** (`case_id = episode_id@days_to_peak`,
`scripts/research_top_anatomy_phase0.py`; each of a case episode's {21,10,5} snapshot days is
matched independently, then deltas collapse episode-first). AM-v2 states its requirement at that
measurement level — the level AM-v1's prose got wrong:

**AM2 (primary construction).** Identical to phase-1 DM — frozen W4 key + episode-age tercile
stratum (same stratum construction, same edges recipe: cut within this construction's pooled
candidate set and printed), episode-first control draw (ONE seeded day per continued control
episode, drawn uniformly from ALL its continued-EXT days) — **plus ONE moved variable**: at NN
time, each case snapshot's control pool is additionally restricted by a hard anchor caliper
`|control days_since_63d_high − case days_since_63d_high| ≤ 2` sessions, both sides measured at
the days entering the feature delta. NN ordering itself is frozen (lexsort on |Δr126|, |Δrv63|;
≤4 NN). Nothing else moves: same episodes, races, features, snapshot collapse, bootstrap, floors.

**AM2-AGEFREE (secondary construction).** AM2 minus the age stratum: frozen W4 key + the same
per-case-snapshot anchor caliper, episode-first draw. Exists solely to give `F1_episode_age` its
only possible anchor-clean read (any age stratum absorbs F1; AM-v1's fresh-high restriction
manufactured young controls). **Bias direction documented pre-results:** low anchor values
correlate with young episode moments, and case anchors concentrate at 0–2, so AGEFREE control
ages will skew young; that pushes the F1 delta (case − control) toward zero/positive — AGAINST
the registered negative direction. AGEFREE F1 therefore has **one-directional power: SUPPORTED is
meaningful (survived despite adverse bias); non-support is UNINFORMATIVE-BY-DESIGN, never a kill.**
The case-vs-control age receipt (medians/quartiles) prints beside the cell.

**Signed validity rule (GOVERNS; per construction × panel).** The anchor diagnostic is the
episode-first-collapsed `F3_days_since_63d_high` gap (case − matched control), with the same
block-bootstrap CI as every registered cell. The construction is VALID on a panel iff:
(a) |point| ≤ 1.0 session; (b) the 95% CI lies within (−2.0, +2.0); and (c) **no reversal** — the
point is not positive with a CI excluding zero (positive = controls fresher than cases = AM-v1's
failure; a small negative residual is the original asymmetry shrunk, acceptable within (a)/(b)).
**Pre-registered escalation, not discretion:** if the ≤2-caliper arm fails validity on a panel,
the ≤1-caliper arm (always computed) GOVERNS that panel — its cells become the registered cells
there, under the same rule. If BOTH fail on a panel, the construction FAILED there: every
registered cell on that panel is graded normally AND carries
`UNDERPOWERED-BY-CONSTRUCTION-FAILURE` beside the grade (phase-1 carry law — carried beside,
never instead of), and no directional conclusion is drawn from it. There is no magnitude-only
boolean and no override path in this design.

## §2 Frozen from phase-0/W2/phase-1 (no re-derivation permitted)

- **Tape:** `data/massive_stock_day`, 2021-07-06 → 2026-07-02 (1,254 sessions), same frozen
  vintage, threaded through the #5319 guard with `--allow-stale` (declared: vintage is
  prereg-frozen; staleness disclosed, not hidden). Universe filter + NASDAQ test-symbol
  disclosure carry forward. **No AM-v2 claim is about today's market.**
- **Track:** W only. **Pipeline:** phase-0 §4.2 episodes / §4.3 races / 36 PIT features /
  {21,10,5} snapshot collapse, episode-first median, episode-peak-month block bootstrap
  **B = 2000**. Bin edges recomputed within each panel's own candidate pool (population-relative,
  as in W2/phase-1). **Seed: 20260812** (fresh — AM-v2's draws are new; declared before results).
- **Instrument:** `engine/top_anatomy.py` byte-frozen at main (`git diff origin/main -- engine/`
  empty at every AM-v2 commit). `scripts/research_top_anatomy_phase0.py` gains plumbing ONLY —
  `--p1-construction {am2,am2_agefree}` extending the existing flag, the caliper filter inside
  the harness-level matcher (`p1_matched_controls` extension; per-stratum engine calls would
  re-cut frozen bin edges and are still forbidden), cache identity stamps extended with the new
  construction keys + caliper value (present-and-equal hard-check), and summary emission —
  committed BEFORE any full-panel result. Feature panels rebuild per (arm × construction) as
  identity requires; repair+segmentation cache shared. If the NaN-safe-emitter chip (sibling
  session) merges mid-wave: absorb by rebase, re-run the determinism check (W2/#5319 procedure).
- **Store access:** read-only mirror from the primary checkout (phase-1 deviation, now declared
  up front).

## §3 Confirmatory hypotheses (declared BEFORE any AM-v2 number exists)

Registered ONLY where a construction can read the leg. Anchors quoted from
`reports/top-anatomy-w2.md` §3–§4, phase-0 run-3, and phase-1 §4 (DM):

| Leg | Direction | Registered in | Anchors (ph0 / R63 DISJ / ATRZ DISJ) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `B3_rsi14_chg10` | + | **AM2** | +1.42 / +2.23 [+0.85,+4.73] / +4.67 [+2.80,+6.71]; DM: +0.429 ns / UNDERPOWERED / +3.268 |
| `B2_rsi14` | + | **AM2** | +1.29 / +3.87 [+2.56,+5.25] / +3.92 [+2.80,+4.79]; DM: +0.952 / UNDERPOWERED / +2.885 |
| `F1_episode_age` | − | **AM2-AGEFREE** (one-directional power, §1) | −9.7 / −2.2 [−3.5,−1.0] / −17.0 [−21.8,−12.3] |

- **Cells:** AM2 {B3, B2} × 3 panels = 6, plus AGEFREE {F1} × 3 panels = 3 → **9 registered
  cells**, all printed with delta + CI + q regardless of outcome. `F3` is the matching variable in
  both constructions → validity diagnostic (§1), never graded. `F1` under AM2 is the
  stratification diagnostic (printed, ungraded — DM convention).
- **Multiplicity:** BH-FDR **q ≤ 0.10 within each (panel × construction) family — of exactly 2
  (AM2) and exactly 1 (AGEFREE)** — one-sided p in the declared direction off the same bootstrap
  draws.
- **Grades:** `P1-SUPPORTED` / `P1-NOT-SUPPORTED` / `P1-UNDERPOWERED` exactly as phase-1 §3,
  plus the §1 construction-failure carry and the AGEFREE one-directional-power reading.
- **Ore-body decision (pre-written, whichever way it falls):** B3 is the ore body's jointly
  readable member (F3 dissolves into the instrument; F1 rides AGEFREE). On each panel where AM2
  is VALID and floors clear: B3 `P1-SUPPORTED` → *"B3 survives anchor-distribution matching;
  with DM's duration discharge, both measured counter-explanations are discharged on this
  panel"*. B3 `P1-NOT-SUPPORTED` → *"B3's separation is anchor geometry, not anatomy"* — and if
  that holds on the floor-clearing disjoint panels, **the ore-body anatomy claim is CLOSED on
  this tape as a cluster claim** (the phase-1 §3 registered kill, now instrument-decided). The
  disjoint panels decide; phase-0 primary is supporting evidence, never the decider.
- **B2 anchor comparison (registered reading):** per disjoint panel, state whether AM2 B2 falls
  inside W2's CI ([+2.56,+5.25] R63 / [+2.80,+4.79] ATRZ). Inside → anchor artifacts do not
  explain W2's confirmation. Below-but-supported → partial artifact share as point ratio (same
  matched design; cross-design ratios banned). `P1-NOT-SUPPORTED` on a floor-clearing disjoint
  panel → W2's B2 confirmation is re-classified as matching artifact and **the phase-1 §7.2
  surface-copy correction obligation REVIVES and is executed in THIS wave** (W2b tier copy +
  W1 wherever it leans on B2).
- **Exploratory:** full 36-feature two-sided tables, both constructions, all panels, BH within
  family, capped EXPLORATORY-DISCOVERY, read from FULL tables only (never `separating` survivor
  lists). **Pre-named reads (still exploratory-capped):** do `E3f_rs_peak_lag` and
  `F2_drawdown_in_episode` — phase-1's 3/3 wrong-sign anchor-family replications inside the
  clean DM arm — vanish under anchor matching (→ anchor-geometry shadows) or persist
  (→ anchor-independent structure)?

## §4 Panels and scope

The three frozen panels: **PRIMARY** (phase-0 run-3 track-W), **R63 DISJOINT** (`r63 ≥ +0.35`),
**ATRZ DISJOINT** (`(c−MA200)/ATR63 ≥ 6`). Scope language frozen from phase-1 §4: AM-v2 decides
**artifact vs anatomy on the same 2022H2–2026 tape**; no out-of-time claim; no surface-authority
upgrade — a surviving leg is display-tier anatomy until a separate promotion prereg passes the
gauntlet.

## §5 Era stratification (MANDATORY), floors, sensitivities

- **Era blocks:** phase-1 §5 recipe verbatim — three contiguous calendar blocks of
  as-equal-as-possible peak-month counts per panel, edges printed; per-era point + CI beside
  every registered cell; `P1-SUPPORTED-ERA-CAVEAT` if the latest-era block is wrong-signed; B2
  fade fence printed on every B2 cell.
- **Floors (per cell):** ≥12 distinct peak-months; ≥100 matched topped episodes; match rate
  printed, <50% adds MATCH-STARVED. The caliper shrinks pools by construction — floors do the
  honest work; a floor miss is `P1-UNDERPOWERED`, never a redesign.
- **Sensitivities (printed, non-binding):** caliper ≤4 (loosen direction; ≤1 is NOT a
  sensitivity — it is the §1 registered escalation); NN cap 8; **AM2 day-weighted candidate
  sampling** — declared purpose: phase-1 located B3-primary's death in the sampling half
  (day-weighted restored +1.371 under DM); if day-weighted AM2 restores B3-primary while
  episode-first AM2 does not, that location replicates under anchor matching. Non-binding: it
  informs mechanism language only, never a grade.
- **Era features:** E3/E4 sign-stability machinery runs on every registered leg.

## §6 Wall, budget, and the report contract

Research wall 12 h off the render path (phase-1 measured 938 s for six runs; AM-v2 runs six:
2 constructions × 3 panels, sensitivities inside each run's wall). Artifacts:
`data/research/top_anatomy_p1_{panel}_{am2,am2_agefree}_summary.json`. Report:
`reports/top-anatomy-amv2.md`, which must LEAD with the §1 validity diagnostics (against AM-v1's
reversal receipts) before any registered number; then labeled-unit censuses (phase-1 §2
three-n discipline), registered tables with grades + carries, era receipts, honest episode-level
N, exploratory full-table reads, and adjudication with the §3 pre-written branches. G0.5
adversarial review (opus reviewer) is MANDATORY before presenting; the coverage gate applies
(lead with what the verdict means for the motivating exemplars and the current regime; name who
is missing from panels; the wave's make-or-break — the validity rule itself — gets red-teamed
first).

## §7 Append-only execution log

- 2026-08-12 — Prereg written and FROZEN before any AM-v2 result exists; committed with
  commit-order proof (this commit precedes all plumbing/results commits on the branch). Seed
  20260812, caliper ≤2 with registered ≤1 escalation, 9 registered cells, signed governing
  validity rule declared. Operator direction to proceed: "okay go" (2026-08-11, after phase-1 +
  W2b shipped).
- 2026-08-12 — PLUMBING OPERATIONALIZATIONS (append-only; declared PRE-RESULTS, in and
  alongside the plumbing commit `cf898eb74cb`, which precedes every result artifact on this
  branch). None of these moves a registered quantity; each records a choice §1–§6 left open:
  (a) **Both-arms-invalid mirror.** §1 says the ≤1 arm governs when ≤2 fails and that a
  both-failed panel is a construction FAILURE with the carry beside each grade, but it does not
  say which arm's numbers the artifact then presents. The plumbing keeps the summary's top-level
  keys mirroring the REGISTERED ≤2 arm in that case, because the escalation exists to elevate a
  VALID tighter arm and a both-failed panel has none to elevate; both arms are emitted in full
  under `caliper_arms` either way, and `governing_arm` records the mechanical determination.
  (b) **Per-arm era/E4.** Era cells, the B2 fade fence, the B2 anchor comparison, the full
  36-feature exploratory table and E3/E4 are computed for BOTH caliper arms rather than for the
  registered arm alone — strictly more printed, so the ≤1 escalation arm is a complete
  registered-cell table and no adjudicator needs a second wave to apply §1.
  (c) **Validity anchor receipts are arm-restricted.** The case-side anchor/age receipt beside
  each arm's validity diagnostic describes the case snapshots that arm actually MATCHED, not
  every eligible case: the caliper drops cases, and an unrestricted case receipt would describe
  a population the estimate never used. The control side is the distinct control DAYS that arm
  used. The panel-level unrestricted case-anchor census stays in `result.cases`.
  (d) **Era-cell/E4 leg list.** Both arms' era cells and E3/E4 run over the construction's
  registered legs PLUS `F3` and `F1`, so the validity diagnostic and the stratification
  diagnostic carry era receipts too.
  (e) **Day-weighted sensitivity scope.** §5 names the day-weighted arm for AM2; it is therefore
  run for `am2` only and not for `am2_agefree` (§5's other two sensitivities — caliper ≤4 and
  NN cap 8 — run for both).
  (f) **Store access** is the read-only mirror at the primary checkout `data/`, exactly as §2
  declares; this worktree's `data/` carries no store.
- 2026-08-12 — EXECUTION RECEIPTS (append-only; builder record, no adjudication). All six
  registered cells ran clean (`rc=0`) inside one wave: wave start 2026-08-12T00:32:44Z, wave
  complete 00:48:33Z, **949.9 s wave-elapsed against the §6 budget of 12 h**. Per-cell
  `wall_seconds`: am2 primary 189.95 / r63 97.52 / atrz 195.88; am2_agefree primary 167.68 /
  r63 96.01 / atrz 196.82. Seed 20260812 and caliper 2 (escalation 1) stamped in every summary;
  `_p1_assert_identity` passed present-and-equal on all six. **Commit-order proof:** plumbing
  `cf898eb74cb` (17:31:30 PDT) and this §7 entry's predecessor `58d04e11a0b` (17:33:31 PDT)
  both PRECEDE the first result artifact on disk (`..._primary_am2_summary.json`, 17:35:54 PDT).
  **Stamp discontinuity, disclosed:** the am2/primary process started at 17:32:44 PDT, i.e.
  between the two commits, so that ONE summary records `git_sha=cf898eb74cb` and the
  pre-append `prereg_sha256`, while the other five record `58d04e11a0b` and the post-append
  hash. Only §7 differs between the two hashes — every frozen section is byte-identical, and no
  registered quantity is affected. **Determinism:** `am2/r63_disjoint` was re-run from the same
  frozen inputs and its summary compared leaf-by-leaf against the wave artifact — **3 differing
  leaves, all clock fields** (`run_timestamp_utc`, `wall_seconds`, `wave_elapsed_seconds`);
  every scientific value, including both caliper arms' matchings, validity clauses, registered
  cells, era cells and full exploratory tables, is identical. **Suite:** `tests/test_top_anatomy.py`
  164 → 196 under `TZ=UTC`, with the new coverage mutation-checked (disabling the caliper filter
  reds 4 tests; flipping validity clause (c)'s sign reds 4 tests; both reverted clean to HEAD).
  The NaN-safe-emitter chip did not land during the wave, so the §2 absorption path was not
  exercised.
- 2026-08-12 — ADJUDICATION (commissioning session; every decision-bearing number re-read from
  the artifacts before ruling). (1) **Validity:** all six (construction × panel) cells VALID at
  both calipers; `governing_arm` = the registered ≤2 caliper everywhere, mechanically —
  `escalated_to_the_tighter_arm=False`, `construction_failure=False` on every cell. No
  escalation fired, no override was needed; the §1 rule governed as designed. (2) **The
  registered kill FIRES:** B3 `P1-NOT-SUPPORTED` on the only floor-clearing disjoint panel
  (ATRZ +1.530 [−0.884, +3.604] q=0.1165) and on primary (+0.133 [−1.142, +1.040] q=0.455)
  under a valid instrument → per §3, "B3's separation is anchor geometry, not anatomy," and
  **the ore-body anatomy claim is CLOSED on this tape as a cluster claim** (B3 killed; F3
  dissolved into the instrument; F1 undecidable within the family — see (4)). Scope per the ore
  law: these constructions, this tape; out-of-time replication is the only reopening evidence;
  the features remain display-tier confluence inputs. (3) **B2 branches:** ATRZ =
  below-but-supported (+1.499 [+0.473, +2.389] q=0.011, OUTSIDE W2's [+2.80, +4.79],
  ratio 0.38×; 0.52× vs DM's +2.885 same-panel) — anchor artifacts do not eliminate W2's
  confirmation and carry roughly half-to-two-thirds of its magnitude there. R63 comparison
  prints inside (ratio 0.87) but the cell is UNDERPOWERED (31 episodes) and decides nothing.
  **The §7.2 surface-copy revival does NOT fire** (it required NOT-SUPPORTED on a floor-clearing
  disjoint panel); W2b copy untouched; the obligation is DISCHARGED-BY-RESULT unless out-of-time
  evidence reopens B2. (4) **F1:** mechanical grades as registered (NOT-SUPPORTED / UNDERPOWERED
  at 99 episodes / NOT-SUPPORTED); the pre-registered one-directional-power reading applies —
  the documented bias realized (control ages skew young: median gaps +14.0 / +5.0 / +11.0), so
  these cells are UNINFORMATIVE-BY-DESIGN for the negative claim, never a kill. F1's
  anchor-clean status is UNDECIDABLE within the matching-instrument family; no AM-v3 is
  chartered. (5) **Era:** zero latest-era wrong-sign flags; no ERA-CAVEAT earned. B2 fade fence
  fires on primary only (0.64 → 0.27 → 0.26); ATRZ stable (1.38 / 2.22 / 2.15). (6) **Match
  starvation is the instrument's printed cost:** seven of nine registered cells MATCH-STARVED;
  AM2 × r63 unreadable (31 episodes, 12 peak-months) — floors did the honest work, no redesign.
  (7) Report: `reports/top-anatomy-amv2.md`. G0.5 adversarial review to follow before
  presenting, per §6.
- 2026-08-12 — G0.5 PASS 1: **NOT PRESENTABLE** (6 blockers / 15 must-fix / 5 nits; every
  transcribed number reproduced exactly — the defects were adjudication-level). CORRECTIONS
  BINDING ON THE PREVIOUS ENTRY (append-only; the entry above is superseded where it
  conflicts): (a) its "0.52× vs DM's +2.885 same-panel" is a **cross-design ratio and is
  withdrawn** — DM and AM2 are different matched designs (different caliper AND different
  declared seed 20260811→20260812 AND different matched cohort), and §3 registers same-design
  ratios only; the compliant decomposition is the two registered ratios 0.74× (DM, phase-1) →
  0.38× (AM2), joint matched-design share ≈62% of W2's ATRZ magnitude, the DM→AM2 step un-CI'd
  and carrying re-draw noise. (b) Its clause (2) fired the cluster branch HARDENED ("the
  ore-body … is matching geometry") — the registered cluster word is **CLOSED** (claim not
  established); the affirmative sentence is registered for B3 only, and the deciding cell's
  fragility (CI contains DM's +3.268 and overlaps W2's interval; q missed by 0.0165; the same
  artifact's ticker-clustered CI [+0.470, +2.721] excludes zero) is now printed beside it —
  NOT-SUPPORTED is failure to confirm, not demonstrated absence. (c) Its clause (4)'s "biases
  it beyond use … no AM-v3 is chartered" overreached: the bias magnitude is unmeasured (the
  caliper ≤1/≤2/≤4 arms move F1 by ≤0.25 sessions and measure nothing about the bias); F1 is
  UNDECIDED-HERE with readability left open, and the no-further-construction decision stands as
  a program choice (out-of-time first), not as proven impossibility. (d) Its clause (3)'s
  revival status is **dormant, not retired** ("DISCHARGED-BY-RESULT" was an undefined status);
  phase-1's era-separation debt on B2 is NOT discharged — B2-primary's AM2 CI [−0.753, +0.955]
  still contains DM's +0.952, so the discovery cohort is unreadable-at-this-power, and the debt
  transfers to panels where B2 stands. (e) The report's "only moved variable" licensing
  sentence was false — the SEED also moved (declared in §2 here, but the report must carry it
  as a second moved variable wherever DM↔AM2 contrasts are read). All findings applied in the
  report revision committed with this entry; verification pass 2 commissioned.
- 2026-08-12 — G0.5 PASS 2: all 26 pass-1 findings verified RESOLVED; **NOT PRESENTABLE** on
  1 blocker / 7 must-fix / 4 nits, all introduced by the pass-1 rewrite (sharpest: the new §1
  coverage paragraph attributed B3's separation to measurement geometry while the report's own
  §5 day-weighted receipts show B3 positive on all three panels WITH anchors matched — the
  mechanism attribution now carries the reconciliation in §1 and §7.1: the registered branch
  names the rival tested, the non-binding sampling arm locates the dependence, both readings
  agree the leg is not established anatomy, neither mechanism proven). All applied in the
  revision committed with this entry; verification pass 3 commissioned. No grade, verdict, or
  registered branch changed in either pass.
