# RIGHTS-0 — China source entitlement / rights audit (researcher commission)

**Program:** `WS:CHINA-ALPHA-INTELLIGENCE` wave `rights0` · **Route:** research (Sonnet `researcher`)
**Authority:** `research/CHINA_ALPHA_INTELLIGENCE_MASTERPLAN.md` §8 (audit-first law) + §13; `DEC:CHINA-ALPHA-INTELLIGENCE-ARCHITECTURE-FREEZE`.
**Spawn note:** paste this file as the commission.

ROUTE: research

MISSION: Produce the rights/entitlement registry that gates every China data
acquisition in the program: for each priority source family, what we are
entitled to TODAY, what an upgrade costs, what the rights of persistence/
derived use are, and a VERIFIED/UNKNOWN verdict per cell. Audit before buying
(masterplan §8.1: "Buy/activate immediately IF NOT ALREADY OWNED — audit
first"). No capture, no purchase, no build.

WHY: P1 (institutional visit tape) is gated on this audit's verdict for the
visit source; every later family (fund holdings, announcements, named actors)
inherits the same registry. The estate's B0 census already established the
FF-1P2 STOP discipline: capture without a rights verdict is forbidden.

SCOPE:
0. **CONSUME PRIOR ART FIRST — three completed rights bodies, none re-derived.**
   (a) The GROK-CN-A return (PR #5945,
   `research/TUSHARE_P0_ENTITLEMENT_RIGHTS_MATRIX_2026-08-19.md`, plus
   `WS:TUSHARE-ENTITLEMENT` and
   `DSC:TUSHARE-TOKEN-IS-NOT-A-COMMERCIAL-GRANT`) already delivers the
   per-family Tushare entitlement/cost matrix (headline verdicts: `stk_surv`
   and `fund_portfolio` COVERAGE_UNKNOWN — [TuShare licensing SUPERSEDED 2026-08-21 — `DEC:CNLI-TUSHARE-COMPLIANCE-IS-CHAIRMAN-VERIFIED-PRIVATE`: compliance is `CHAIRMAN_VERIFIED_PRIVATE / SATISFIED`, no vendor letter is required or may be requested, and the remaining blockers below are collector/coverage work only.] formerly
   "pending vendor letter"; `anns_d` and
   互动/e互动 NOT_NEEDED — native/CNInfo coverage exists; `report_rc` OWNED).
   (b) The GROK-CN-B return (PR #5947) already RAN the PRC entity-resolver
   bake-off and returned NO-BUY — adopted into the masterplan (§8.2 settled);
   its rights/ToS findings on Qichacha/Tianyancha are your resolver cells.
   (c) The GROK-CN-E return (PR #5951) already ran the commercial
   supply-chain diligence and returned NO seat purchase absent a written
   redistribution/derived-display grant — adopted (§8.3 settled); its
   license findings are your commercial-foundation cells. Read all three in
   full, adopt their cells with citations, and record deltas only where your
   own verification disagrees or where they left UNKNOWN.
1. **Tushare families — residual only** (client `collectors/tushare_client.py`,
   token env `TUSHARE_TOKEN` — name only, NEVER read or print its value):
   verify #5945's matrix against the repo state (consumed today, verified
   2026-08-19: `stk_auction*`, `stk_mins`, `stk_premarket`, `cyq_perf`,
   `moneyflow_dc`, `daily_basic`, `margin_detail`, `forecast_vip`,
   `report_rc`, `broker_recommend`, chips-distribution), fill any family the
   matrix omits (named actors `hm_list`/`hm_detail`, top-holder/holder-trade
   endpoints), and add the PIT-class column (does the API expose
   announcement/publish date distinct from effective date?) where #5945 did
   not answer it. Account-specific entitlement stays UNKNOWN(operator) —
   never probe the API with the token.
2. **Non-Tushare live sources already in production** — `collectors/china_irm.py`
   (SZSE 互动易), `collectors/china_einteraction.py` (SSE e互动),
   `collectors/china_lhb.py` + block trades (akshare/Eastmoney),
   `collectors/china_reports.py`, `collectors/china_analyst.py`,
   `collectors/china_filings.py` (cninfo metadata), holder-count/holder-sale
   collectors: state the source ToS/robots posture, whether our use is
   read-display-derive, and any redistribution limit that binds product
   display. Tag UNKNOWN where the ToS is unreadable.
3. **Primary official sources for the visit family**: SZSE/SSE investor-
   relations disclosure pages and cninfo 调研 records as the non-vendor
   fallback for P1 — availability, machine-readability, history depth, ToS.
4. **Entity-resolver vendors** (Qichacha / Tianyancha / equivalent): the
   bake-off is SETTLED NO-BUY (#5947; masterplan §8.2) — do NOT re-open it.
   Your registry records #5947's rights findings as the vendor cells, plus
   the persistence/derived-use posture of the PRIMARY-SOURCE resolution route
   PR-0D will use (official registries, exchange pages) — the rights question
   that remains live.
5. Deliverable: `research/china_alpha_intelligence/RIGHTS_REGISTRY.md` — one
   table per family: {source, endpoint/page, access today (present/absent in
   repo), plan/point requirement, rate limit, history depth, PIT class,
   persistence rights, derived-use rights, product-display rights, verdict
   tag}. Plus a P1-specific verdict paragraph: which visit source the P1
   builder should use first and what remains operator-decidable.

OUT OF SCOPE: No API calls that spend entitlement or reveal the token's tier;
no scraping; no capture; no purchases; no ToS acceptance (prohibited action —
flag for operator); no new collectors; no edits outside
`research/china_alpha_intelligence/`.

QUESTIONS: (1) Can P1 run on Tushare `stk_surv` at a documented point tier, and
is our tier sufficient (or operator-unknown)? (2) Which of the seven priority
families are already effectively owned via live non-Tushare collectors?
(3) Which families carry redistribution/display restrictions that shape the
Hub/dossier surface? (4) What are the persistence/derived-use rights of the
primary-source identity-resolution route (the #5947 no-buy stands — vendor
cells come from that return, not fresh diligence)?

SOURCE STANDARD: Every claim tagged CODE VERIFIED (repo receipts, path:line) /
PRIMARY SOURCE VERIFIED (named public doc/ToS URL + date) / INFERRED /
UNKNOWN / UNKNOWN(operator). Chinese-language primary sources are first-class;
quote titles bilingually.

NOT DONE UNLESS: the registry covers all seven priority families + the four
resolver/ToS questions; every cell carries a tag; the P1 verdict paragraph
exists and names its blockers; `git status --short` shows only
`research/china_alpha_intelligence/` additions.

EVIDENCE REQUIRED: repo receipts for access-today claims; named URLs + access
dates for every rights claim; explicit UNKNOWN cells rather than guesses.

RETURN: STATUS / RESULT (the P1 verdict + top-line per-family verdicts) /
EVIDENCE / GAPS / DEVIATIONS.
