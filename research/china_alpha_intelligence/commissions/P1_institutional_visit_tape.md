# P1 — Institutional Visit Tape + dossier (builder commission)

**Program:** `WS:CHINA-ALPHA-INTELLIGENCE` wave `p1` · **Route:** build (Sonnet `builder`)
**Gate:** spawns only AFTER the RIGHTS-0 verdict names a lawful visit source.
**Authority:** `research/CHINA_ALPHA_INTELLIGENCE_MASTERPLAN.md` §6 F1 + §13 P1; FABLE-B first-PR acceptance; `DEC:CHINA-ALPHA-INTELLIGENCE-ARCHITECTURE-FREEZE`.
**Spawn note:** paste this file as the commission; fill the SOURCE slot from RIGHTS-0 before spawning.

ROUTE: build

MISSION: Build the China institutional visit tape end-to-end at display tier:
collector (source per RIGHTS-0 verdict: __SOURCE__) → owner-native PIT store →
actor identity resolution (typed unresolved allowed) → dossier display →
failure states → prospective outcome accrual hooks. NO score of any kind.

WHY: Institutional Discovery is the program's first vertical (masterplan §14
milestone 1): observing the professional discovery funnel
(SEARCH → THESIS → REVISION → ALLOCATION) before consensus is the strongest
short-term China information edge. The repo has NO visit data today (verified
2026-08-19: greps for 调研/diaoyan/inst_visit across engine/scripts/config
returned zero collector hits).

SCOPE:
- **Collector**: new `collectors/china_visits.py`, registered in
  `scripts/collect.py`'s asia group (pattern at scripts/collect.py:230-250),
  running ONLY in `.github/workflows/asia-close.yml` (daily.yml excludes the
  asia group and resets stray china writes — daily.yml:372, 632-634). Respect
  the render budget: metadata-first two-stage ingestion (masterplan §10) — the
  visit-event metadata row (who/when/company/type/published_at) establishes
  the information clock; body/detail hydration is a separate later stage, not
  this PR. **Failure isolation (asia-close is C0 market-critical) — isolated
  AND loud (Sol precision ruling 2026-08-19):** every failure mode of this
  collector — source down, schema drift, rights refusal, rate limit — must
  degrade to a typed empty/partial result for THIS plane only; it must never
  raise into the lane runner, never delay or fail the market-critical
  collectors, and never leave a partial write that a rerun cannot reconcile.
  BUT isolation is never silence: a source failure must emit a typed
  degraded/failed health state (plane-level health record the dossier and
  monitoring can read), and a run whose collector failed must NEVER advance
  a `measured_no_event` state for any name — "we looked and saw nothing" is
  only assertable when the source was actually read. A silent failure that
  presents as a quiet tape is the named defect. Prove BOTH halves with
  injected-failure tests (lane survives; health goes loud; no
  measured_no_event advance).
- **Store**: new owner-native plane `data/china_visits/` (visits remain in the
  visit source plane — masterplan §4.1; this is the lawful new-store case: no
  existing owner). Append-only, dated, dedup on a stable natural key; every
  row carries `source_published_at` AND `system_recorded_at` (PIT truth = what
  was knowable when). No backfill claims presented as prospective history.
- **Actor identity — PROVISIONAL ontology**: resolve visiting-institution
  names to the manager-complex ontology draft
  (`research/alpha_intelligence/censuses/B0/B0_MANAGER_COMPLEX_DRAFT.md`)
  where deterministic; otherwise typed `unresolved` — NEVER fuzzy-guess
  (masterplan §5 exact-identity law; vendor IDs are aliases, not authority).
  That ontology is a DRAFT frozen only at the estate K2 wave, so every row
  stores the RAW source actor string alongside the resolved class plus an
  ontology-version stamp — the K2 freeze must be able to re-map every
  historical row without rewriting history. Company-side identity: canonical
  listing identity only; unresolved stays typed unresolved.
- **Coverage-start semantics**: the tape's history begins at OUR coverage
  start, not the phenomenon's. Every derived novelty read — first-visit
  flags, "new visitor", recency — is `first_seen_since_coverage_start`,
  computed against a persisted per-plane `coverage_start` stamp, and the
  display layer says so in plain words. No construction may present
  coverage-start artifacts as real-world firsts.
- **Dossier**: extend `engine/china_intel_hub.py` `_dossier()` (L608-610,
  assembled L1299-1315) with a visit-tape block: recent visits, visitor
  classes, first-seen-since-coverage-start flags — descriptive only,
  plain-word glance tier per the design doctrine. Read DESIGN_DOCTRINE.md +
  invoke the frontend-design skill before touching the user-facing surface.
- **Failure states**: the ten-state taxonomy (masterplan §9.3): measured
  no-event / no coverage / not yet available / stale / source failure /
  rights suppressed / identity unresolved / not applicable / low extraction
  confidence / contradicted — visit block must render honest nulls (never
  zero-as-missing).
- **Prospective accrual**: stamp rows so a FUTURE P1B state
  (abnormal/new/independent visitor metrics) can accrue outcomes
  prospectively — no metrics, no score in this PR.

OUT OF SCOPE: NO "visit = bullish" anything — no score, no rank input, no
Prophet contact, no board/serving change (serving firewall: masterplan §11.4).
No universal Evidence Mesh dependency (boring baseline: owner-native store +
direct readers — P1 explicitly does not block on mesh runtime). No fund/
analyst/Q&A work (later verticals). No LLM extraction in this PR (metadata
stage only). No second identity plane.

FROZEN SPEC: masterplan §6 F1 + §13 P1 + this file. Store schema field names
follow the plane conventions in `collectors/china_irm.py` (nearest sibling:
keyless nightly, cursor shard, parquet store).

OWNED FILES: `collectors/china_visits.py`, `scripts/collect.py` (registration
lines only), `engine/china_intel_hub.py` (dossier block only),
`scripts/build_china_intel_hub.py` if the block needs plumbing, new tests.

TESTS: collector unit tests on fixture payloads (dedup, PIT stamps, refusal
paths, injected-failure isolation); dossier render test with visit block +
each failure state; identity resolution test incl. typed-unresolved and
raw-string+ontology-version persistence; coverage-start semantics test (a
name first seen mid-coverage is flagged since-coverage-start, never "first
ever"); no full-suite in a sparse tree.

NOT DONE UNLESS (FABLE-B acceptance + §0-bis completion law): a REAL
company's CURRENT visit event flows source → PIT truth → actor identity →
dossier → failure states → prospective outcome accrual, demonstrated with
receipts in the PR body (fixture-driven locally). Zero score fields anywhere
in the diff. Ship loop owned to merged + WS wave `p1` flipped to
**`BUILT_NOT_PROVEN`** — NOT `done` — in the same PR.

COMPLETION LAW (masterplan §0-bis, binding): `p1` flips to `done` ONLY after
(a) a REAL `asia-close.yml` production run has collected real visit rows
end-to-end (run id recorded), AND (b) the PRODUCTION dossier — the deployed
page, not a local render — shows the visit block for a real company with
honest failure states, proven with desktop AND mobile crops recorded in the
WS record. Your PR body names this receipt protocol and states the flip
belongs to the follow-up verification session, never to the merge.

Continuation handoff (FABLE-B): state coverage on Prophet candidates,
PIT/history class, independent user value, research eligibility, unresolved
rights/identity, next vertical.

RETURN: STATUS / RESULT / EVIDENCE (PR number, fixture receipts, dossier
screenshot or rendered-block excerpt) / GAPS / DEVIATIONS.
