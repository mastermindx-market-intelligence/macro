# Time-Confound Re-Check Adjudication — Rulings RC-RUL-1..6

**Date:** 2026-07-07 (RC-RUL-1..5) · 2026-07-13 (RC-RUL-6)
**Adjudicator:** Fable (main loop)
**Authority chain:** DT-W1a (research/dannytrades/DT_W1_RESULTS.md) → Ruling DT-R14 → research/TIME_CONFOUND_EXPOSURE_AUDIT.md (#1755) → re-check evidence PRs #1850 / #1855 / #1864 / #1866 (+ OTA-RC-2, pending at time of writing; #1875 for RC-RUL-6).
**Discipline:** every re-check froze events/cohorts/thresholds and changed inference machinery only, passed a mandatory reproduction gate against the shipped numbers before running new inference, and shipped labeled "adjudication pending." This document is the adjudication.

> **In plain English:** we re-measured five sets of shipped results with the clock controlled. Outcome: one production-relevant promotion warrant is withdrawn (the anti-chase hard-gate evidence was the calendar, not the signal), one compound promotion candidate loses its gauntlet pass (A9), and three things we expected to weaken actually survived the harder test (the member-transmission chip, A15/A17-modern, and the P3 secondary — which got *stronger*). The healthcare null stands on repaired machinery. Nothing here was decided by re-running until we liked the answer: every re-check had one pre-specified design, and the internal positive controls confirmed the machinery can still detect real effects (T02 survived at −9.66pp).

## RC-RUL-1 — Entry Intelligence P1.3 / F3 anti-chase (EI-RC-1, PR #1866)

**Evidence** (`research/entry_intel/p1_runs/P1_3_TC_RECHECK/RESULTS.md`; reproduction gate exact to 0.000% on all five trials; within-month label-permutation null clean; +2pp injection detected):

| Trial | Shipped delta (pp) | Time-controlled delta (pp) | 95% CI | exact p | BH q (m=5) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T02 F1 dead-money 21d | −13.19 | **−9.66** | [−11.61, −8.05] | 0.0000 | 0.0000 |
| T09 F1 RW stop 63d | −4.55 | +0.01 | [−3.08, +3.26] | 0.53 | 0.66 |
| T18 F2 RW cushion 21d | +0.15 | +0.42 | [−0.58, +1.35] | 0.19 | 0.48 |
| T21 F3 HG stop 21d | −0.43 | +0.82 | [−2.69, +4.45] | 0.66 | 0.66 |
| T24 F3 HG stop 63d | −5.00 | +0.04 | [−3.66, +3.27] | 0.52 | 0.66 |

**Rulings:**

1. **The P1.3 evidentiary designation "F3 anti-chase SHIPS-AS-HARD-GATE" is WITHDRAWN.** Both F3 trials (T24, T21) collapse to zero on the within-month-demeaned, month-block basis — the shipped stop-rate deltas were calendar composition, exactly the half-concentration signature the audit flagged (T24 half1 −8.75 / half2 −1.55). No production rollback is required: the implementation was shadow-first per Article 2 (P2.1a; `antichase_shadow_ledger.parquet`), so no money-path change ever rested on the confounded CI.
2. **P2.1a flip terms tightened:** the R-P2.1 floors (100 blocked episode-clusters + 2 quarters) remain necessary but are no longer sufficient — any future flip decision must ALSO include a DT-R14-compliant read (within-period demeaning + calendar-block resampling) of the accumulated shadow-ledger data. P1.3 no longer supplies a standing in-sample warrant; the forward ledger must earn the flip on its own.
3. **T02 (F1 dead-money) is REAFFIRMED on the time-controlled basis** (−9.66pp, CI excluding zero, BH 0.000) — the one P1.3 effect that was real all along. Its status is unchanged (future clade note; F1 gate remains rejected on fire-cost grounds, which are mechanical and unaffected).
4. **The P2.1b F1 rank-weight KILL stands, with corrected rationale:** the original T09 promotion evidence is now shown to have been time-confounded (+0.01pp TC), so the kill no longer rests solely on the proxy→production sign reversal — the promotion evidence never existed on a compliant ruler.
5. Consequential (no action): P2.5's six shadow configs inherited the same episode-permutation machinery; they remain shadow-quarantined with their in-sample perm_p now formally discounted — the forward ledger arbitrates, as already ruled.

## RC-RUL-2 — Oracle W2 member-transmission (OTA-RC-1, PR #1855)

**Evidence** (`research/oracle_asymmetry/W2_TC_RECHECK.md`; reproduction exact): 35 windows collapse into **9 macro-episodes** (gap ≤10 td). Episode-cluster 90% CIs: ΔWR21 [0.0399, 0.1901] (shipped window-cluster [0.0537, 0.1757]); Δmean_ret21 [0.0107, 0.0493]. Period-matched R3 baseline: Δ=0.1051, CI [0.0207, 0.1692]. All lower bounds remain above zero.

**Ruling: the CONFIRMED / display-with-edge verdict STANDS.** The audit's expected downgrade (CONFIRMED→PARTIAL) did not materialize: the deltas survive the coarser, honest clustering unit and the corrected holdout baseline, with narrowed margins. Caveats attached: (a) 7 in-arm episodes is a thin resampling base — the CI is honest but fragile; (b) the episode-joint placebo was not built (the shipped window-level placebo remains operative); it is an optional accrual item, not a blocker; (c) the §5 forward ledger remains the decisive arbiter, unchanged.

## RC-RUL-3 — Oracle compound gauntlet & P3 secondary (ORC-RC-1, PR #1864)

**Evidence** (`research/ORACLE_COMPOUND_TC_RECHECK.md`; reproduction exact): circular time-shift placebo (preserves inter-onset spacing/clustering; 2000 draws) vs shipped independent-draw placebo:

| Compound | Shipped G3 p | Time-shift p | G3 under time-null |
|---|---|---|---|
| A15 (full) | 0.0000 | 0.0095 | holds |
| A9 (full) | 0.0000 | **0.1390** | **does not hold** |
| A17 (full) | 0.0000 | 0.1050 | does not hold (read already superseded) |
| A17 (modern, n=73) | 0.0000 | 0.0130 | holds |

P3 secondary `ep_in_onset_21d` under calendar-month block bootstrap (142 months): CI [+0.15%, +1.11%], p=0.0045 — **stronger** than the shipped detection-order-block read (p=0.0075).

**Rulings:**

1. **A15 gauntlet PASS is REAFFIRMED** under the time-preserving null (p=0.0095). The research-factory paper pipeline built on A15 is unaffected.
2. **A9's gauntlet PASS is WITHDRAWN.** Its G3 evidence does not survive a null that preserves temporal clustering (p=0.139). A9 reverts to `screened` evidence status only (its registry status never advanced, so no registry edit is needed); it is no longer a promotion candidate absent fresh out-of-time evidence. The gauntlet R1 document carries the amendment banner.
3. **A17: the modern-regime read (the operative verdict since the 2026-07-04 correction) STANDS** (p=0.013), with its existing n=73 caveat. The full-history read — already superseded — is additionally confirmed non-robust under the time-null (p=0.105); it must not be revived.
4. **`ep_in_onset_21d` may now be cited** — with the month-block CI, which supersedes the detection-order block read. The audit's precondition ("re-express before citing") is satisfied, and the effect strengthened under the compliant ruler.
5. **Standing instruction:** future compound-gauntlet rounds use the circular time-shift placebo (now in `scripts/research/oracle_compound_tc_recheck.py`) as the G3 null, not independent index draws.

## RC-RUL-4 — Healthcare R-1 construction divergence (HC-RC-1, PR #1850)

**Evidence** (`research/CONSTRUCTION_DIVERGENCE_R1_TC_RECHECK.md`; reproduction gate pass; CD-1/CD-2/CD-3 repaired — 419 real ±7d cross-sector co-firing blocks, block-cluster bootstrap): DD21 pooled +0.27% CI [−0.26, +0.83] (null, unchanged); DD63 pooled +0.85% CI [−0.07, +1.84], p=0.072 (marginal, includes zero); DD63 stress-stratified null in BOTH strata (stress p=0.774, calm p=0.103). DD63 tail (p10): div −12.35 [−15.88, −10.28] vs con −15.12 [−16.75, −13.22] — non-overlapping cohort CIs, no CI on the difference.

**Ruling: the R-1 "null held" LOCK is REAFFIRMED — now on repaired machinery.** The audit's false-null concern is resolved: with real calendar-block inference, no clear masked effect emerges (the pooled DD63 marginal does not survive stratification). Consequential rulings: (a) `scripts/study_construction_divergence_tc.py` is the **mandatory apparatus** for any future R-1 verdict batch — the original script's inference path (CD-1/2/3 defects) is retired for inferential use, retained as historical record; (b) the DD63 tail asymmetry (divergent cohort's p10 genuinely shallower) is logged as a **descriptive watch item** for the accrual — if a future batch tests it, the test must be pre-registered on the repaired apparatus with a quantile-difference bootstrap.

## RC-RUL-5 — SEQ_TLT_RELIEF_WASHOUT (OTA-RC-2, PR #1869)

**Evidence** (`research/ORACLE_SEQ_TC_RECHECK.md`; reproduction exact to rounding): 745 fires collapse to **610 episodes across 157 calendar months (2002-10→2026-05, mean 1.22 fires/episode)** — the clustering the audit feared is MILD; this signal is not a 2021+ concentration artifact. Episode-cluster 95% CIs (2000 draws): full WR [0.637, 0.707] — LB clears the Leg-2 bar (0.62); holdout WR [0.631, 0.744] — LB clears the Leg-5 bar (0.58); ret_exit [+1.86%, +2.88%] excludes zero; asym [1.50, 2.04] — LB exactly at the 1.5 bar. **Leg-6 under a circular time-shift placebo: observed +2.37% vs p95 +3.75% — DOES NOT CLEAR** (the shipped independent-draw bar of +1.16% is an independence-assuming null and is hereby retired for verdict use).

**Rulings (split verdict):**

1. **Registration STANDS at registry status `screened`** — the display ceiling the signal already had. The conditional-shape evidence (WR, holdout replication, asymmetry) survives honest episode-cluster inference at its pre-registered bars.
2. **The affirmative Leg-6 timing claim is WITHDRAWN.** Under a null that preserves the fire sequence's temporal structure, +2.37% is not distinguishable from a fortunate calendar offset at the 5% level. Interpretation discipline both ways: the single-offset circular shift has low effective null degrees of freedom (each draw is one fully-correlated portfolio), so this is a wide, conservative bar — failing it does not prove the signal is calendar luck; it removes the affirmative timing evidence.
3. **Promotion path BLOCKED:** any advance beyond `screened` (P3-style registration shot, sizing input, NW authority above display) requires first clearing a pre-registered time-preserving placebo with adequate power. Design guidance for that prereg: per-episode independent block shifts (preserves local clustering, restores null df) or a washout-conditioned placebo that isolates the *ordering* value — the redundancy audit already established the causal ordering IS the claimed edge, so that is the null to beat.
4. **Standing law (extends RC-RUL-3):** the reversion screen's Leg-6 independent-draw placebo is retired as a verdict instrument for all future gauntlet rounds; time-preserving nulls are required. `scripts/research/oracle_seq_tc_recheck.py` generalizes.
5. **Follow-up registered (not run):** the other 10 rows of the published reversion base passed the same retired Leg-6 machinery. Before ANY of them is promoted beyond display, sweep them with the time-shift placebo (the re-check script takes a spec id; cheap). Display status is unaffected meanwhile. *(Executed 2026-07-07 as `research/ORACLE_REVERSION_BASE10_TC_SWEEP.md`, evidence PR #1875; adjudicated 2026-07-13 → RC-RUL-6 below.)*

## RC-RUL-6 — Reversion base, 10 non-SEQ rows (base-10 sweep, evidence PR #1875)

**Date:** 2026-07-13. Resolves RC-RUL-5 item 5. Adversarial review before ruling: an implementation lane verified the sweep faithful (reproduction gate exact on all 10 rows — n exact, WR/ret_exit within 1pp; shipped Leg-6 bars reproduced to 4 decimal places; JSON/MD artifacts fully consistent; the `ORACLE_REVERSION_VALIDATED.md` edit is annotation-only), and a statistical red-team argued both the kill and the revival directions per house law (scrutinize kills as hard as promotions).

**Evidence** (`research/ORACLE_REVERSION_BASE10_TC_SWEEP.md`, seed 20260705, 2000 draws): under the time-preserving circular time-shift placebo, **8 of 10 rows do not clear p95** (7 tier-S rows p .14–.28; RSLAG p=.058 near-miss). **M1_OIL_DOWN_K30_RS_NEG clears (p=.041)** on 45 calendar months (20 dev / 25 holdout) and **SRM_BEARTAPE_ACCEL_K20 clears (p=.019, regime-matched risk_off pool)** on only 16 calendar months (12 dev / 4 holdout). Episode-cluster CIs: ret_exit excludes zero for all 10 rows; WR LB ≥ 0.62 for all but RSLAG (0.591); holdout WR LB ≥ 0.58 for all but R16 (0.571); asym LB < 1.5 on all seven tier-S rows.

**Rulings:**

1. **Display status STANDS at registry `screened` for all 10 rows.** Reproduction is exact, every pre-registered point-estimate gate leg still passes (WR ≥ 0.62, asym ≥ 1.5, holdout WR ≥ 0.58, ret_exit > 0 — all on the bars as registered), and all episode-cluster ret_exit CIs exclude zero. Nothing in the sweep contradicts any published block; there is no basis for demotion.
2. **Affirmative time-preserving timing evidence is NOT ESTABLISHED for 8 of 10 rows** (A15, B4_WASHOUT, B4_EP, R16, E_DOLLAR, R3_B2, R4, RSLAG). RC-RUL-5 ruling 2's interpretation discipline applies verbatim and both ways: the single-offset circular shift is a wide, conservative bar with low effective null degrees of freedom — failing it does not show calendar luck; it removes the affirmative timing claim. These rows' Leg-6 reads may no longer be cited as timing evidence.
3. **M1 and SRM time-shift clears are promotion-ENABLING, not promotions.** This sweep is a re-check re-expression, not a prereg (its own header says so). For any future promotion prereg, **M1 ranks first** (45 calendar months, asym LB 2.573, holdout WR LB 0.588 clears 0.58; caveat: tier-M 2021+ era-inflated magnitudes per its own registry note). **SRM is a distant second on independent-time grounds:** 16 calendar months total, all risk_off, 2022–2026 — the DT-R14 HIGH-exposure fingerprint; a p=.019 whose independent-time base is ~16 months is thin regardless of its 1079-episode count.
4. **Promotion beyond `screened` stays BLOCKED for all 10 rows** pending a pre-registered, adequately-powered time-preserving placebo (same design guidance as RC-RUL-5 ruling 3: per-episode independent block shifts to restore null df, or a null isolating the claimed mechanism ordering).
5. **The CI-LB dips are robustness caveats, NOT gate failures.** The pre-registered Leg 2/3/5 bars are point-estimate bars (`research/ORACLE_REVERSION_GATE_PREREG.md`, frozen PASS thresholds) and every row clears its registered bar. Applying CI-LB tests retroactively would be a post-hoc tightening this adjudication declines — consistent with RC-RUL-5 ruling 1, which held SEQ at `screened` with its asym LB exactly at 1.5. The dips (asym LB < 1.5 on all tier-S rows; RSLAG WR LB 0.591 < 0.62; R16 holdout WR LB 0.571 < 0.58) are recorded here so any future prereg must budget for them.
6. **Holdout-coverage disclosure law (standing, extends the DT-R14 rubric):** any report printing an episode-cluster **holdout** CI must print the holdout's calendar-month and distinct-date coverage alongside it. The motivating case: SRM's holdout WR CI [0.764, 0.836] is bootstrapped over 402 node-episodes that span **4 calendar months / 23 distinct risk-off dates** (median 11 nodes co-firing per date, per registry `oos_holdout`) — read as 402 independent units it is drastically anti-conservative. The sweep's JSON carried the months column; its report table suppressed it. That CI must never be cited without the coverage line. (Disclosure postscript appended to the sweep report in this ruling PR.)
7. **Machinery notes for the next prereg (non-verdict-changing, inherited from the canonized time-shift machinery):** (a) the time-shift null pool matures on the exit window (+21) while real fires and the old bar mature on the MFE/MAE window (+25) — up to 4 late-tail pool dates per node that can never be real fires; (b) the observed statistic executes at trigger+1 while the null pool is keyed at the date itself — a 1-session frame offset (shape-unbiased under uniform offsets, but the observed is not a zero-offset member of its own pool); (c) `ts_p` omits the +1 permutation correction ((1+#{null≥obs})/(1+draws)); corrected, M1 .0410→~.0415 and SRM .0190→~.0195 — no flips here, but the prereg must use the corrected form. These are critiques of the standing standard (`oracle_seq_tc_recheck.py` shares them), to be fixed in the prereg design, not retrofitted into this re-check.

## Scoreboard (audit prediction vs adjudicated outcome)

| Re-check | Audit flip expectation | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| EI-RC-1 (F3 gate warrant) | HIGH flip risk | **Flipped — warrant withdrawn** (T24/T21 → 0) |
| EI-RC-1 (T02 control) | expected to survive | Survived (−9.66pp, q=0.000) |
| OTA-RC-1 (W2 CONFIRMED) | MEDIUM, → PARTIAL | **Stood** — margins narrowed, LBs > 0 |
| ORC-RC-1 (A15) | MEDIUM | Stood (p=0.0095) |
| ORC-RC-1 (A9) | MEDIUM | **Flipped — PASS withdrawn** (p=0.139) |
| ORC-RC-1 (A17-modern) | MEDIUM-HIGH | Stood (p=0.013, n=73 caveat) |
| ORC-RC-1 (P3 secondary) | exposed | Stood and **strengthened** (p=0.0045) |
| HC-RC-1 (R-1 false-null) | LOW-MED masked effect | No masked effect — lock reaffirmed |
| OTA-RC-2 (SEQ_TLT) | MEDIUM, registered→marginal | **Split** — WR/holdout legs stand on episode CIs (clustering was mild: 610 episodes/157 months); Leg-6 timing claim withdrawn (+2.37% < time-shift p95 +3.75%); promotion blocked pending time-preserving placebo |
| Base-10 sweep (RC-RUL-6) | n/a — registered by RC-RUL-5 item 5, not in the original audit | **Split, per-row** — all 10 stay `screened` (reproduction exact, registered bars pass, ret_exit CIs exclude zero); timing claims withdrawn on 8/10; M1 (p=.041, 45 mo) and SRM (p=.019, 16 mo) clears logged promotion-enabling only; promotion blocked for all 10 pending prereg |

Two full flips, one partial withdrawal, five survivals, one strengthening — the audit's ranking was directionally right (its #1 item flipped; the survivals were mostly in the MEDIUM band), and the re-check pattern (frozen events, inference-only, reproduction gates, positive controls) held everywhere. DT-R14 is confirmed as load-bearing beyond the DannyTrades family — and equally, a survival under the harder ruler is as informative as a flip.
