"""COUNT-NEUTRAL matched-event lead analysis (the decisive 'do we enter earlier?').

The raw per-signal stats in tuning_harness are confounded by signal COUNT: a trigger
that fires more often will look different for reasons unrelated to timing. This driver
isolates the owner's actual question -- "does the candidate enter the SAME move EARLIER
and at a BETTER price than the lagging 3D MACD?" -- by PAIRING each baseline buy with
the nearest candidate buy and measuring the lead (in trading days) and the entry-price
improvement. It is immune to the candidate simply firing more.

For each baseline (base3d) buy at daily fill bar fb (since SINCE):
  * find the nearest candidate buy whose fill bar fc is within [fb-WIN, fb+WIN]
  * lead_days   = fb - fc           (positive => candidate entered EARLIER)
  * price_impr  = base_px/cand_px-1 (positive => candidate entered CHEAPER/lower)
Plus coverage (fraction of baseline moves the candidate also caught) and the count of
EXTRA candidate buys with no baseline match (the cost of firing earlier = more entries).
