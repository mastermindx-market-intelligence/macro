"""Reusable WALK-FORWARD validation harness for the signal engine — STOP-AWARE.

> READ research/signal_engine/CHARTER.md FIRST (§2 lens, §3 metrics, §4 tripwires).

WHAT THIS JUDGES — AND WHY IT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE OLD HARNESS
--------------------------------------------------------------
The owner trades **with a stop-loss** (default ≤ −5%). A *bad entry* is therefore one
that gets **faked out and stopped out** before the move it was trying to catch. So the
ONE metric that matters for entry quality is the **stop-out / shake-out rate**: the
fraction of taken entries that hit the stop. LOWER is better.

This is a deliberate correction. A PRIOR harness scored the **loose-hold max drawdown**
of a position carried with NO stop (the "−23.7% → −15.5% max-DD" headline). That number
conflates *entry quality* with *exit policy* — it is the drawdown of a strategy nobody
runs. Two positions can have the same loose-hold max-DD yet wildly different stop-out
behaviour, and the owner only ever experiences the stopped version. So we simulate every
trade **AS TRADED, WITH THE STOP**:

    enter on the (leak-free) signal  ->  exit at the ≤ stop_pct stop  OR  the validated
    exit signal (confluence SELL* / fast-reversal cut), whichever comes first  ->  re-buy
    on the next reversal signal.

and we judge on stop-out rate + the realised per-trade loss distribution UNDER that stop
+ entry efficiency. Total return AND loose-hold max-DD are carried only as clearly
labelled CONTEXT fields and can never enter a verdict (charter §4 tripwire #1).

THE SIX COMPONENTS THE TASK ASKS FOR
------------------------------------
  1. PURGED / EMBARGOED WALK-FORWARD.  Expanding train [0:Ti], test [Ti:Ti+test_len],
     rolled by `step`, with a `purge` gap before each test and an `embargo` after it, so
     no test bar's information bleeds into a neighbouring split.  (`make_windows`.)

  2. LEAK-FREE MULTI-TIMEFRAME BAR -> DAILY MAPPING.  A 3D bar is labelled by its OPEN
     date (`confluence.compute_signals`' session-grouped geometry — `tf_bars` delegates
     to `confluence._3d_groups`, so the two label systems cannot drift) but its close is
     only KNOWN on the bar's LAST traded session, 2-4 calendar days later.  Every TF bar
     is mapped to its true known-date and fired on the first daily bar STRICTLY AFTER it.
     The whole trade simulation then runs on the DAILY grid so a ≤ stop_pct stop is
     checked every day (a 3D-only sim would step over intraday shake-outs).  (`tf_bars`,
     `to_daily`, `_daily_events_after`.)

  3. AS-TRADED-WITH-STOP METRICS.  stop_out_rate (PRIMARY), realised-loss distribution
     under the stop, avg loss size, entry efficiency, per-trade expectancy, win rate.
     NOT total return, NOT loose-hold max-DD.  (`simulate_trades`, `trade_metrics`.)

  4. CROSS-SECTIONAL AGGREGATOR.  Percentile stats of the metric across 110+ names AND
     the **% of names improved vs baseline** — never just a pooled mean.  (`cross_section`.)

  5. OVERFIT GUARD.  In-sample vs out-of-sample decay flag + the pre-committed KILL RULE:
     reject unless >= 70% of HELD-OUT names improve on the stop-based metric, deflated for
     the number of trials searched.  (`overfit_guard`, `kill_rule`.)

  6. PER-TRIAL JSON LOGS to data/signal_archive/wf_<run_id>.json.  (`_write_log`.)

Interface (the contract):

    walk_forward(signal_fn, panel, cfg, baseline_fn=None, ...) -> {by_ticker, pooled, overfit_flags}

  * signal_fn / baseline_fn : a SIGNAL CALLABLE.  daily close -> daily buy events.
      - simple:  fn(close, high=None, low=None) -> pd.Series[bool]   (daily BUY events;
                 paired with the default confluence exit + the panel's daily high/low.)
      - rich:    fn(close, high=None, low=None) -> pd.DataFrame with daily-indexed
                 boolean 'buy' and (optional) 'exit' columns.  Use this to supply your
                 own exit; close/high/low for the stop ALWAYS come from `panel` so the
                 stop is checked on real daily bars.
  * panel : {ticker: DataFrame with 'close' (and ideally 'high','low' for an intraday
            stop; close-only names fall back to a close-based stop).}
  * cfg   : {train_len, test_len, step, purge, embargo, stop_pct=-0.05}.  Window lengths
            are in DAILY bars (the sim grid); stop_pct is the stop (negative).

Gold-standard self-test:  `python3 walk_forward.py --gold`
  Runs the validated buy-filter (engine/signal_quality / diagnose_v2.refined_buy) against
  raw confluence buys on data/stocks/ and confirms the FILTER REDUCES THE STOP-OUT RATE
  (the honest, as-traded restatement of the old loose-hold "−23.7 -> −15.5" headline).
