"""Historical + unit regression for the brain's entry-quality BREADTH consumer.

What it confirms (honoring CHARTER §2–4, §6f — microscope, not verdict machine):

1. The REGIME-tracking dimension is the 200-day TREND breadth (above200%), and it moves
   monotonically with the equity regime: broad-up in a bull, split in a chop, broad-down
   in a bear. The 3D-confluence long/short STATE mix is a mean-reversion-oscillator read
   (CHARTER §5) — short-horizon ENTRY-timing colour, NOT a regime read (at a local low
   inside an uptrend the whole universe reads short-bias). So the consumer anchors the
   regime CONFLICT on trend breadth and reports entry quality separately. This test does
   NOT claim the state mix tracks the regime — only above200% does.
2. The calibration conflict fires ONLY when breadth DISAGREES with the macro posture
   (rolled-over / narrow tape under risk-on; still-broad tape under risk-off), and the
   payload is internally consistent (a broad-up trend never carries a "rolled over"
   message — entry-narrowness is flagged as entry-narrowness).

Historical breadth is rebuilt AS-OF each date by truncating every US deep-history close
series and running engine.signal_quality.analyze — the same code path the live snapshot
uses (scripts/build_signal_quality.py). Display/diagnostic only. Run:
