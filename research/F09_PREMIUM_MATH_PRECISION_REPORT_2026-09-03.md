# F09-1 — evidence-bound cash-deal premium/spread: precision and coverage report

Operation `marketontology-f09-premium-math-v1-20260902-sol-001` · carrier
[macro#6785](https://github.com/mastermindx-market-intelligence/macro/issues/6785) ·
branch `claude/f09-premium-math-v1-20260903` · base `origin/main@5af021ba`.

Context-only throughout. Nothing here scores, ranks as a signal, sizes, or feeds Prophet.

## 1. The defect, measured before any change

`data/special_situations/context/latest.json` (`special_sits_context.v1`, `asof=2026-09-01`) on
`origin/main` led `risk_arb_top` with:

```json
{"ticker": "LGMK", "company": "LogicMark, Inc.",
 "gross_spread_pct": 64.57, "annualized_pct": 42790.2, "days_to_close": 30}
```

Five keys. No deal price, no close price, no exchange session, no accession, no source URL, no
formula revision, no quality state. **The absence is the defect — not the magnitude.**

Reproduced directly against the `origin/main` module (receipt below is verbatim output):

```
1. month-end substitution:
   days_to_close('2026-11', 2026-09-01) = 90   <- an unobserved day, invented
2. ungrounded publication:
   {'deal_price': 25.0, 'live_price': 15.19, 'gross_spread_pct': 64.58,
    'days_to_close': 90, 'annualized_pct': 654.3, 'consideration': 'cash'}
   provenance keys present: []
3. consumer divergence — special_sits_intel sorted `annualized_pct or 0`
```

Three independent causes, each now closed:

| # | Cause (origin/main) | Site | Closed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `YYYY-MM` silently resolved to **month end**, then annualized off the invented day | `special_arb.py:185-187` | month-end resolution deleted; a window keeps `days_to_close=None`, `annualized_pct=None` |
| 2 | live price was `panel[col].dropna().iloc[-1]` — a bare last-non-null row, no session, no as-of, no freshness | `special_situations.py:622-624` | typed `price_input` carrying session, `sessions_behind`, basis, source artifact, calendar |
| 3 | "unaffected" price was a fixed **30-row** lookback (rows are not sessions) | `special_situations.py:625` | filing-reference price = last session **strictly before** first verified SEC availability, or `REFERENCE_SESSION_UNRESOLVED` |
| 4 | `mastermind_emit` filtered `consideration == "cash"`; `special_sits_intel` did not, and sorted `annualized_pct or 0` | `special_situations.py:966` vs `special_sits_intel.py:1088` | one `select_ordered_context()` owner consumed by both |
| 5 | a `0.6–1.8` plausibility band already guarded this path and **admitted** LGMK (ratio 1.6457) | `special_arb.py:130` | band and `_DAYS_CAP` removed — a clamp that lets the defect through is not a gate |

**Test coverage before this wave: one assertion** — `assert "risk_arb_top" in result`. That is
how 42,790.2% reached every Neural Web consumer without anything failing.

## 2. Precision gate — zero false precise publications

22-case corpus, `tests/fixtures/special_situations/f09/corpus.json`, run through the real
extractor and current-term compiler:

| verdict | n |
|---|---|
| correct publication (price matched the expected value exactly) | 9 |
| **correct decline** (no price published where none may be) | 10 |
| recall miss (should have published, declined) | 0 |
| **FALSE PUBLICATION** | **0** |

Three cases were added by the critical repair, all previously absent and all reproduced as
false publications first (§8): a rejected historical **cash** proposal under *Background of the
Merger* beside a current **all-stock** merger (measured at head `a88c12f2` as `VERIFIED`, offer
48.00, spread +20%, consideration `cash`); a *Prior Proposals* price that is the document's only
per-share number; and a **fairness-opinion** DCF value quoted beside a correctly-scoped offer,
which must NOT suppress the real price. Out-of-scope prices are not discarded — all three are
retained as `deferred` observations noted `outside_current_transaction_scope`, so the evidence
stays visible while never becoming a live term.

Hostile negatives that must never yield an offer price, and all declined: special **dividend**
per share, preferred **redemption** price, option **exercise** price, **aggregate/enterprise**
value expressed per fully diluted share, two **conflicting** cash prices in one filing, and
**per-ADS vs per-ordinary-share** wording for different amounts.

Cases that legitimately observe a price but are refused downstream by the reducer rather than by
the extractor: `cash_and_stock_merger` ($12.00 cash leg → `NOT_FIXED_CASH`),
`contingent_value_right` ($9.00 + CVR → `NOT_FIXED_CASH`), `cross_currency_bare_dollar` ($32.00
on a CAD listing → currency never established, `AMBIGUOUS`).

### Honest limits of this number

- **The corpus is authored, not sampled.** The excerpts are written in canonical SEC
  merger/tender phrasing; they are not verbatim filing bodies, because committing production
  filing bodies is forbidden by the operation. So **100% recall here is a statement about the
  corpus, not about EDGAR.** Real-world recall is unmeasured and is expected to be materially
  lower — the extractor is deliberately tuned to decline.
- Precision is the load-bearing claim, and it is the one the design optimises: every candidate
  span must survive an explicit per-share anchor plus a ±160-character negative lexicon.
- Recall against live filings can only be measured on the natural production run, which is
  gated behind #6783 (Mac Studio daily-runner recovery). Until then this capability is
  `BUILT_NOT_PROVEN / PRODUCTION_INERT`.
- A bare `$` is admitted as USD **only** where it cannot be anything else (no other dollar
  qualifier anywhere in the document AND a USD listing). Every observation records which of the
  four `currency_basis` values applied, so an inference can never be mistaken for an observation.

## 3. What a published number now carries

```
term      → accession, CIK, form type, filing date, source URL, body sha256,
            document id, character offsets, excerpt sha256, extraction revision
price     → exchange session, sessions behind expected, price basis, source artifact, currency
clocks    → source filing date · system availability (acquired_at) · market session ·
            calculation as-of (calc_asof) · build time — five distinct clocks, never merged
formula   → formula_revision, and four SEPARATELY named numbers:
            stated_premium_pct · filing_reference_premium_pct · live_gross_spread_pct ·
            annualized_pct (exact observed close DATE only)
state     → VERIFIED · STALE_PRICE · AMBIGUOUS · NOT_FIXED_CASH · TERMINAL ·
            SOURCE_UNAVAILABLE · INELIGIBLE_CATEGORY · CALCULATION_UNAVAILABLE
```

## 4. LGMK disposition

The mandated regression canary is **excluded from the ordered context with a typed reason**,
not clamped and not deleted:

- with the same offer and close price but **no observed exact close date**, the row computes a
  real `live_gross_spread_pct` (visible), `annualized_pct = None`, `orderable = False`, reason
  `DATE_PRECISION_INSUFFICIENT`, and is counted in the visible degraded census;
- with a genuinely observed exact date it publishes with full receipts — pinned by
  `test_an_extreme_but_fully_grounded_value_is_disclosed_not_hidden`, where a grounded extreme
  value is published and flagged `extreme_value: true` rather than banded away;
- `test_no_clamp_no_band_no_ticker_exception_in_the_owner` fails the build if the string `LGMK`,
  `_PLAUS_LO`, `_PLAUS_HI` or `_DAYS_CAP` ever reappears in the owner.

Whether the *real* LGMK row is grounded or excluded on live data is answerable only by the
natural production run — see §5.

## 5. What is NOT proven

- No production proof. The daily route is under the #6783 disk-admission floor, and this
  capability may not claim `PROVEN_LIVE` until one natural authoritative cycle emits the
  artifact and the real Neural Web consumers read it. No dispatch was made to manufacture proof.
- The observation ledger (`data/special_situations/observations/observations.jsonl`) has never
  been written by a production build; it is exercised only by tests in tmp dirs.
- Real-world extraction recall is unmeasured (§2).
- The five Neural Web consumers (`mastermind_context`, `world_state`, `ask_brain`,
  `brief_context`, `cortex`) were censused and pass through `risk_arb_top` rows unchanged, so
  the richer rows propagate without edits. That is a read of their code, not a live observation.

## 6. Market Ontology disposition (MO-PAID-064 / MO-DELTA-023)

Recorded here rather than by editing
`MARKET_ONTOLOGY_F00C_GRANULAR_CLOSURE_LEDGER_2026-09-02.csv`: that file is F00C's dated
closure artifact and belongs to a different operation. Rewriting another lane's dated ledger
would destroy its record; final ledger reconciliation belongs to acceptance, not to this wave.

F00C row `MO-PAID-064` (paired `MO-DELTA-023`) carries:

- `granular_disposition: NEW_BOUNDED_BUILD`, `capability_state_c2: PARTIAL`
- `next_bounded_child: SPLIT — premium-math slice BUILDABLE-NOW from EDGAR tender filings;
  financing-path/break-fee stays RIGHTS-GATE`
- `acceptance_test: one classified M&A event gets computed premium math`
- `authority_ceiling: research_only`

**Disposition after this wave.** The premium-math slice is **source-complete and unproven**:

| ledger field | state after F09-1 |
|---|---|
| premium-math slice | implemented under the existing owner — no new store, scheduler or plane |
| acceptance test ("one classified M&A event gets computed premium math") | **not yet satisfiable in production** — the collector lane that writes the observation ledger has no caller, and the natural daily route is under the #6783 floor |
| financing-path / break-fee / antitrust | untouched, still RIGHTS-GATE — explicit F09-1 non-goals |
| authority ceiling | unchanged `research_only`; `is_signal=False` is structural in the reducer's output |
| capability state | `BUILT_NOT_PROVEN / PRODUCTION_INERT` — **not** `PROVEN_LIVE` |

The honest reading of the acceptance test is that it is **not** met: computed premium math now
exists and is grounded, but no classified M&A event has passed through it in production. Two
things must land first — the `enrich_deal_terms()` caller (awaiting a path-boundary ruling) and
the #6783 host recovery. Both are recorded as `next_actions` in
`agentos/handoffs/MARKET-ONTOLOGY-F09-PREMIUM-MATH-2026-09-03.md`.

## 7. Repair after Sol's exact-head review (review 5099936758)

The independent review rejected the first head and named eight defects. Six were real
false-precision holes; three of those my own records had half-named without my drawing the
conclusion. All are repaired at this head.

| # | Defect on `5db9634a31a3` | Repair |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `enrich_deal_terms()` never called by `build(refresh=True)` — a natural run leaves the ledger empty and every deal reports `SOURCE_UNAVAILABLE` | wired into the refresh sequence **before** `desk_payload()`, under the granted one-path expansion; `--no-refresh` stays source-inert, pinned by a build-path test |
| 2 | observations grouped by issuer **CIK**, so two unrelated deals shared terms | accession-isolated; multiple accessions merge only through an explicit `link_supersession()` chain. `/A` or a shared filer proves nothing |
| 3 | digest taken over `_strip_markup(raw)[:40000]` while the span claimed `full_submission_text` | complete response bytes retained (`raw_sha256`/`raw_bytes`) beside a **versioned** normalized projection; `completeness ∈ complete/truncated/unknown`, and anything but `complete` can never be VERIFIED |
| 4 | ledger checked a `schema` label; malformed JSON skipped silently | every row re-validated against a **closed** digest; malformed/invalid rows counted and surfaced as `INTEGRITY_FAILED` + `PARTIAL_GENERATION`, never a healthy subset |
| 5 | `_calendar_index` derived the expected session from the panel being graded | `lib/nyse_calendar.py` **unchanged** as the owner; every price carries `calendar_owner`, `calendar_revision`, `expected_session`, `sessions_behind` and an immutable `artifact_sha256` |
| 6 | `market_currency("") → "USD"`; date-only `date_filed` as availability; `date.today()` as market clock | unresolved listing returns `None`; reference sessions need the exact SEC acceptance moment parsed from source bytes; `now_utc` is a **required** argument — omitting it raises |
| 7 | consideration matched document-wide, so a background CVR could classify the live deal | every field resolves inside one `transaction_scope()` anchored on the price span and cut at section boundaries |
| 8 | `stated_premium_pct` published with no comparator | publishable only with a captured basis; no comparator, or two disagreeing ones, publishes nothing — and never substitutes for the computed filing-reference premium |

### Evidence

- **RED first**: 16 new mutants failed against the reviewed head before any fix; all green now.
- **Required REDs, all present**: same CIK/two deals · forged observation · tampered offset ·
  malformed trailing JSONL line · truncated body · unresolved foreign listing + bare `$` ·
  whole-panel stale · missing calendar receipt · premarket vs after-close acceptance · real
  `build(refresh=True)` path · background-only CVR · cash financing beside a stock deal ·
  two premium comparators · bare `35% premium`.
- **143 passed** across `test_special_arb` / `test_special_situations` / `test_special_sits_intel`.
- **No regressions**: 40 failures across the full dependent surface, all in unrelated suites
  (`china_heatmap_gate`, `us_board_gate`, `seo_meta_rollout`, …) that need `site/`/`data/`;
  **zero** in any `special_*` suite.

### One repair that changed a rule rather than a line

The premarket/after-close mutant exposed a second bug behind the first. `_reference_price`
compared the session index's **midnight** against the acceptance moment, so a filing accepted at
07:45 ET selected that same day's *unclosed* session as its reference. Keying the comparison to
the session's 16:00 ET close fixed it — and made the previously-passing
`test_filing_day_close_is_not_a_reference_price` wrong on its own premise, since an after-close
filing genuinely may use that day's close. That test was replaced rather than patched.

`DSC:A-DIGEST-OF-A-DERIVED-PROJECTION-IS-NOT-BYTE-BINDING` records the transferable half: no
single layer lied — the falsehood lived at the seam between "the bytes I hashed" and "the
document I claimed", which is precisely what per-layer review does not inspect.

## 8. Critical repair after the independent NOT PASS

The head that §7 describes, `a88c12f2`, was then reviewed independently and **failed**. The
reviewer reproduced Sol's seven blocking repairs and added four defects neither Sol's review nor
this lane had named — three of which reached `VERIFIED` on a wrong or unproven number. Sol folded
them into one addendum (carrier `1788441394.459699`) and required a single return covering the
complete set. This section is the record of that repair; §7 remains the record of the round
before it, and the sections are deliberately not merged, because the useful fact about this wave
is that a green suite, a passing exact-head review by the *author's* own lane, and a full CI pack
sweep all held simultaneously with three `VERIFIED`-reaching defects still live.

| # | Defect at `a88c12f2` | Repair |
|---|---|---|
| NEW-1 | `observation_id()` excluded `prior/supersedes_observation_id` and `correction_reason`, so `link_supersession()` recomputing the id returned the **same string** — a no-op. A hand-forged relation validated `True`, and `compile_current_terms` then admitted an entire multi-accession bucket whenever *any* `supersedes` matched *any* id in it | the correction relation moved **inside** the closed digest, so a changed relation cannot keep its identity; `validate_lineage()` additionally proves predecessor existence, same-field lineage, direction and acyclicity; and the compile now walks the connected lineage **out from the requested accession** instead of admitting the bucket |
| NEW-2 | `_price_inputs` graded Canada/intl/HK panels against `lib/nyse_calendar` and stamped `calendar_id=XNYS`. On 2026-07-03 NYSE was closed while HKEX traded, so a genuinely one-session-stale `.HK` column reported `sessions_behind=0` and reached `VERIFIED` | V1 admits only an exact resolved **U.S.** listing: `resolve_us_listing()` plus a closed `calendar_id`/`listing` check. No suffix-root fallback, no foreign panel, no syntax-derived currency |
| NEW-3 | the pure reducer never cross-validated its own receipt: `_has_calendar_receipt()` checked field *presence*, `sessions_behind` was taken from the caller, `session` was never compared to `expected_session`, any string passed as a `basis`, and `price_input()`'s own default was `close_raw` | `validate_price_receipt()` re-derives every recomputable field through the calendar owner and checks the rest against closed vocabularies; the reducer publishes **its own** recomputation, so a published freshness number cannot disagree with the calendar even when the producer is wrong |
| NEW-4 | `_fetch_filing_text()` returned the legacy `.txt` **before** `_retain_source()` ever ran, so every already-cached accession could never obtain a receipt; `enrich_deal_terms()` skipped it and the natural build passes `fetch_missing=False`. Coverage over the pre-existing corpus was structurally zero, permanently, with no backfill path | a legacy candidate cache with no verified receipt now goes back through the same fetch owner to reacquire the exact complete bytes; `--no-refresh` stays network- and source-inert |
| CONFIRMED | a rejected historical `$48.00` cash proposal under *Background of the Merger*, beside a current all-stock merger, published `VERIFIED` / offer 48.00 / spread +20% / consideration `cash` — the scope anchored on the first price candidate and cut *into* the background section | one deterministic current-transaction scope; background, prior-proposal, fairness-opinion, financing and employee-award spans cannot originate a current term. Out-of-scope prices are retained as `deferred`, not discarded (§2) |
| CONFIRMED | SEC acceptance timestamps hard-coded to `-04:00`, wrong for every winter filing | `ZoneInfo("America/New_York")`, byte-equivalent to the proven `sec_capital_structure` parser and pinned by a test that runs both over the same bytes |
| CONFIRMED | the ledger appended with `open(..., "a")` after silently skipping malformed lines; the JSON Schema accepted any `observation_id` of 8+ characters and required none of the source receipt | validate-the-whole-ledger-before-append, atomic publish + readback, `INTEGRITY_FAILED` / `PARTIAL_GENERATION` with a census; schema hardened to a closed 32-hex id and a conditional `allOf` that requires `raw_sha256`, `raw_bytes`, `acquired_at` and `completeness=complete` for any observed exact term |

### The mutation gate, and the one guard it caught

The suites passing is not the evidence — Sol required discriminating mutants, and the reason is
visible in the result. Ten mutants were applied one at a time to the repaired sources, each
re-introducing exactly one defect above, with the file restored from the index between runs:

| mutant | verdict |
|---|---|
| M1 correction lineage removed from the `observation_id` digest | killed |
| M2 caller's `sessions_behind` trusted again | killed |
| M3 `basis` vocabulary opened | killed |
| M4 receipt's declared `expected_session` no longer compared | **SURVIVED 197/197** |
| M5 non-US listing/calendar admitted | killed |
| M6 `rebind_observation()` neutered | killed |
| M7 SEC acceptance clock hard-coded to `-04:00` | killed |
| M8 legacy `.txt` returned before reacquisition | killed |
| M9 malformed ledger line silently skipped | killed |
| M10 schema `observation_id` loosened to `minLength: 8` | killed |

M4 is the finding. The `expected_session` comparison is *correct code*, shipped in the repair,
reviewed, and pinned by **nothing**: deleting it left every test green. The four sibling
freshness tests each move `session` or `sessions_behind` as well, so recomputed staleness
arithmetic reddens them first and the finer check never decides anything. The killing test has to
do the opposite of what feels thorough — hold `session` and `sessions_behind` genuinely honest for
`now_utc`, so the price really is current and nothing downstream disagrees, and corrupt only the
receipt's own claim about which session the market last completed. It matters because that field
is **published**: a `VERIFIED` row would have carried a calendar fact no calendar owner produced.
Closed by `test_a_false_expected_session_field_is_invalid_even_when_the_price_is_current`; the
matrix is then 10/10 at 198 passing. Recorded as
`DSC:A-GREEN-SUITE-CANNOT-TELL-YOU-WHICH-GUARDS-IT-PINS`.

### Regression evidence, controlled

The four owned suites are **198 passed**. For the rest, the sparse worktree makes a raw failure
count meaningless — unrelated suites need `data/` and `site/`, which are not checked out — so the
comparison is run as a true A/B on the *same* tree, same data, same sparseness: the 33 other test
files that reference these modules are run once against the repaired sources, then again with
`origin/main`'s versions of all six F09 paths swapped in and nothing else changed.

| side | result |
|---|---|
| repaired branch | 40 failed, 1547 passed, 19 skipped |
| `origin/main` F09 sources swapped in | 40 failed, 1547 passed, 19 skipped |

The failing sets are **identical, test for test**: 40 failures present on both sides, 0 present
only on the branch, 0 present only on main. Zero regressions attributable to this repair, and the
40 are pre-existing sparse-worktree artifacts in unrelated suites. Every F09 source file was
restored from the index afterwards and re-verified by blob digest.

## 9. CI repair and the current-transaction scope addendum

Head `bb86d760`'s hosted authority came back red on four checks. They are not one class, and the
distinction is the whole point of this section — a binding red is never waived, but neither is
it inherited without reading its own payload.

| check | classification | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `contract-delta` | **candidate-caused** | job `100865703147`: `8 introduced, 0 inherited (base 3f8c1faa48a5)` |
| `trusted-ci / trusted-executor-pack-7` | external infra transient | `admin-js-no-undef` timed out at 180 s on a cold `npx` eslint fetch; every other job in the pack passed |
| `ci-gate` | aggregation boundary | downloaded zero semantic fragments although the trusted packs uploaded `trusted-ci-fragment-*` |
| `ci-authority/codex/merge-queue-pilot` | inactive base context | own payload: `allowed:true`, `reason:same_repo_admin_authority_change`; fails only on `context_active:false / inactive_base_context` |

**contract-delta is mine, and the trap here is that it might not have been.** The known failure
mode of this gate is billing a PR for a main-side gap when the branch base predates the commits
that widened some job's import closure. Five of the eight findings named `engine/qual_extraction.py`
against `biocatalyst-*`, `flow-surface` and `unrun-*` — jobs F09 never touches — which is exactly
what that artifact looks like. It was tested rather than assumed, and the answer was the other
way: `engine/special_situations.py` gains `from collectors import special_situations as col`
(line 715, absent on `origin/main`), `collectors/special_situations.py` already imports
`engine/qual_extraction.py` on main, and that single new edge widens six job closures at once.
Genuinely introduced.

Repaired by the bounded widening Sol authorised for exactly one manifest path — eight added
lines in `.github/ci/legacy-jobs.yml`, zero removed, no scope-mode change, no job-command edit.

**Proving it on the right tree.** Running contract-delta locally against current main reports a
*different* finding — `tests/test_top_anatomy_oot_receipt.py` unwired — which is neither mine nor
real: that file exists on both sides, main's manifest wires it in three places, and this branch's
older manifest carries none of them. CI never saw it because CI evaluates the **merge ref**,
which carries main's manifest. So the verification was done on the tree CI will actually build:
main's manifest plus the eight additions, contract-delta against main →
**`0 introduced, 0 inherited`**. The local-only finding is a stale-manifest artifact of this
branch's base and requires no action.

### The scope fallback, and what removing it exposed

Sol's semantic addendum removed the last false-precision fallback in the pure owner:

```python
chosen = (anchored or admissible)[0]      # -> return None when nothing is anchored
```

An unanchored section is not a proven current transaction, so selecting it made **document
order** the authority for which deal a published price belongs to. Three hostile REDs pin the
repair — two unanchored `Item` sections where the first holds a declined `$48.00` indication; a
lone unanchored section holding the document's only per-share number; and the same shape with a
real anchor in the *second* section, which must still publish `$75.00` and prove the change did
not become blanket refusal. Reverting the fallback fails exactly the two decline cases and
leaves the third passing, which is the correct discrimination signature.

Removing it also made five previously-green tests fail at once, and the triage is the finding.
The four **negative** corpus cases (dividend, redemption, exercise price, aggregate value) still
declined correctly. The other four — `contingent_value_right`, `cross_currency_bare_dollar`,
`explicit_foreign_currency`, `terminated_offer` — are *genuine* current transactions whose
phrasing `_CURRENT_TXN_ANCHOR` simply never carried: "holders **will receive** $9.00", "each
common share **will be acquired for** C$32.00", "the **previously announced merger** providing
for $21.00". The fallback had been silently supplying scope for all four, so the vocabulary's
real coverage was unmeasurable for as long as it existed.

Extending a closed vocabulary is categorically different from restoring a fallback even though
both turn tests green: **a missing phrase is a recall bug, a fallback is a false-precision bug.**
The widened pattern still requires the document to assert a transaction; the fallback required
only that the document have sections. The four negatives still declining is the proof the
distinction held. Recorded as `DSC:A-FALLBACK-MAKES-ITS-PRIMARY-PATHS-COVERAGE-UNMEASURABLE`.

Both repairs are pinned by mutants of their own. The matrix grew to twelve: **M11** restores the
`(anchored or admissible)[0]` fallback, and **M12** narrows `_CURRENT_TXN_ANCHOR` back to its
pre-round vocabulary — the exact gap the fallback had been hiding. Both are killed, so neither
half of this repair can be silently undone.

## 10. Ledger clock and listing authority

Sol's third addendum found a runtime authority bypass the JSON Schema never covered: the schema
is exercised only by tests, while the two production readers call `validate_observation()`, which
re-derives a row's id **from the row's own fields**. Three source fields decide real outcomes and
none of them was bound to anything outside the row:

| field | what it decides | bypass |
|---|---|---|
| `acceptance_datetime` | which session `_reference_price()` draws the filing-reference premium from | premarket vs after-close resolve to different sessions |
| `filing_date` | which observation is CURRENT — `compile_current_terms()` orders on it | a superseded term can be made current |
| `resolved_listing` / `currency` | whether a bare `$` may become USD | `_load_observations()` passed `authored_terms(listing_currency=o.get("currency"))`, so the untrusted row nominated the authority that then blessed it |

Repaired with one law, consumed by **both** readers so neither is the lenient one. The three
fields are now inside the closed `observation_id` digest, and — because resealing is not
authorization — each is additionally re-bound to a party with no reason to agree with the row:
`acceptance_datetime` to the retained acquisition receipt's own parsed canonical UTC,
`filing_date` and `resolved_listing` to `canonical_event_authority()`, built from the Special
Situations event table and admitted only where the per-ticker Yahoo `close_price` owner actually
proves the listing. Missing event authority fails closed. `authored_terms()` is keyed on the
canonical currency, never the row's.

Six hostile REDs, each resealed after tampering and each asserted against **both** the collector
readback and the engine runtime: acceptance clock flipped premarket↔after-close; `filing_date`
moved so a stale term would sort current; listing receipt stripped while the row asserts USD; a
listing promoted to one the canonical event never had; plus positive controls proving the
untampered ledger still rebinds idempotently and the legitimate U.S. fixed-cash case still
reaches the reducer at `offer_price == 25.0`.

### Three mutants the new law itself hid

Extending the matrix to fifteen caught something worth recording: **three previously-killed or
assumed-covered behaviours had become unpinned, and the cause was this repair.** Once a corrupt
ledger could reach `ok is False` through the new *unbound* path, every assertion phrased as "the
census is unhealthy" was satisfied either way — so deleting the malformed-line counter changed
nothing (M9, previously killed). Likewise the independent rebind is thorough enough that dropping
the three fields from `observation_id()` (M14) and reverting `authored_terms()` to the row's own
currency (M15) both broke no test, because the coarser gate caught those mutants first.

That is the same shape as §8's M4, arriving from the opposite direction: there a guard was never
pinned, here a *stronger* guard un-pinned weaker ones that had been fine. A defence-in-depth layer
is only real if something fails when you remove it alone. Three tests now pin each layer
separately — malformed counted *as malformed*, an unresealed edit rejected on identity alone
(`invalid`, not merely `unbound`), and `authored_terms` proved to receive the canonical currency
via a row that simply omits its own.

Final state: **209 passed** across the four owned suites, **15/15** mutants killed,
`agentos validate` 0 errors.
