# Group Reads — basket participation, episodes, and earnings co-movement (MASTERPLAN BY FABLE)

**Date:** 2026-08-08 · **Status:** RATIFIED (operator directive 2026-08-08: match and exceed Jodie.ai's theme/basket engine; integrate with the earnings intelligence data plane) · **Program home:** extension waves inside the Thematic Intelligence Layer (`research/THEMATIC_INTELLIGENCE_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md`, rulings R-TIL-1..9) and the Company Event Intelligence Spine docket (`research/COMPANY_EVENT_INTELLIGENCE_SPINE_AND_PREMIUM_IR_SUITE_BUILD_DOCKET_2026-08-01.md` §3.1/§4.1 `theme_state.v1` charter). This is an **organ-cluster extension, not a new lobe** (DNR:KILL-THESIS-LOBE, R-TIL-1).

---

## §0 ACCEPTANCE GATES (binding on every wave; PR is not done unless)

**G0-1 (contract validity).** Every artifact this program ships validates against its frozen schema in §4 (unknown keys rejected, `authority: "context_only"` stamped, coverage counts present on every cross-sectional stat). A pytest exercises the validator against a golden artifact AND a mutated artifact that must fail.

**G0-2 (no fused score).** No wave may mint a composite/weighted cross-basket score, rank, or "heat" number (R-TIL-3; DNR:KILL-COMPOSITE-REGIME-RELIABILITY-MONITOR). Radar ordering is a deterministic disclosed RULE over named legs, printed on the surface it orders. A grep-able tripwire test asserts the pulse artifact contains no key matching `(score|rank|heat)` outside the documented allowlist.

**G0-3 (display tier, honest nulls).** Every group read ships display/context tier. Washout/turn group constructions carry the Oracle P8 null disclosure in their Tier-2 hover ("sector-grain washout→turn printed NULL standalone; context only, forward-graded"). No entry/rank/size/gate/alert authority anywhere (DNR:KILL-PSS-SR3-PARTICIPATION, DNR:HOLD-IGNITION-SURFACES). The words "igniting/ignition" are banned on these surfaces. The word "validated" is banned (CI-enforced repo-wide).

**G0-4 (nightly sole advancer).** The episode ledger and sympathy ledger advance ONLY in the nightly lane; intraday lanes discard `data/` writes. Append-only with a replay-determinism test (same inputs → byte-identical ledger tail).

**G0-5 (CI registration).** Every new module lands with tests registered as a job in `.github/ci/legacy-jobs.yml` (with the required `if: ${{ false }}` boilerplate) so a pack executes them. Registering the guard is proven by a pack run, not by the file edit.

**G0-6 (render budget).** New nightly compute is an ASSEMBLER over existing artifacts (`data/baskets/ohlcv`, breadth caches, existing organ outputs). Measured wall-clock for the full US basket sweep ≤ 90s on the render host, printed in the PR body. Anything heavier moves off the render path.

**G0-7 (surfaces).** UI waves: per-step visual crops (light + dark + zh) posted in the PR body; banned-vocab scan clean (no internal state names, no untranslated stats, no raw slugs at glance tier); plain-word stance line answers "so what do I do" even when the answer is "watch — don't chase"; graceful absence (a missing JSON renders a quiet null state, never a broken panel); no new header family; `?v=` stamping via the render lane.

**G0-8 (no self-merge on first-pass flagship UI).** Surface-wave builders return PR + crops to the commissioning session for review before merge (spawn-handoff law §4).

**G0-9 (bilingual).** EN/ZH from day one on every new user-facing string, in templates AND builders where copy originates. No translated text in `title=` attributes.

**G0-10 (coverage floors).** Every cross-sectional stat over basket members declares `n_members`, `n_covered`, and refuses (renders null with a plain-word reason) below its floor rather than computing over survivors (nullable-input coverage-floor law; gap-refusal law).

## §1 Verdict — Jodie.ai teardown vs. this repo (2026-08-08)

Teardown source: live walk of jodie.ai (landing, `/theme/lin_e4aa24a058493242f958`, Group Radar, Today feed), 2026-08-08.

| Jodie capability | Their form | Ours today | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Group discovery | Market-discovered co-movement "connected sets" (~40), auto-named, noisy (preferred shares as members; misfiled tickers) | `engine/theme_discovery.py` (co-movement candidate generator) + **48 curated PIT baskets** (`data/baskets/membership.json`) + regional twins | **We exceed** — curated + discovered + PIT membership hygiene |
| Participation | % members with **unusual activity** (attention, separated from price direction) | `theme_scoring._breadth_leg` (% above 50d/200d, live on basket pages) — **trend** participation only | **Gap: activity axis** — attention-based participation not computed |
| Direction agreement | "% agreement — not a clean directional move" | `group_flow.cohesion` (mean pairwise member correlation, computed nightly, **dark** — no UI) | **Gap: sign-agreement % + surfacing** |
| Capital flow | Inflow/Outflow + conviction | `theme_flow_rollup.accumulating_pct` (computed, not wired); options `flow_cohorts` (4 cohorts) | Gap: surfacing only |
| Outside confirmation | Filing-linked outsiders (customers/suppliers/partners) confirm/not, with receipts | Issuer-evidence graph EXISTS (`collectors/issuer_evidence.py`, `engine/government_revenue/issuer_graph_expansion.py`) but **govrev-scoped** | **Gap: generalize + join to baskets** |
| Episode history | Discrete co-movement episodes + per-episode persistence % | `basket_history.py` (score history); **no episode ledger** | **Gap: episode state machine + persistence** |
| Arc / washout state | **Absent** — Jodie never answers "is the washout done at group level" | Validated per-name capitulation (`coiled.washout_ctx`, gauntlet-passed), `cycles.cycle_state` (days-since-low), list-agnostic `sector_bottom.member_breadth`, `basket_turn_watch` K-of-N, Weinstein stage + `stage_flows` | **We exceed** once assembled — this is the operator's core ask and Jodie's biggest hole |
| Earnings integration | **Absent** | `earnings_release/` figures+binding (per-event structured data — the dependency `theme_catalyst_binder` declared missing, now shipped), `guidance_gap` (18 themes), `theme_revisions`, `equity_earnings` surprise history | **We exceed** once rolled up per basket — the moat |
| Plain-word reads | Stance lines, strengthens/weakens-if, honest nulls | House design doctrine mandates exactly this | Parity of intent; ours must be assembled |

**Verdict:** the measurement layer is already integrated — in several axes beyond Jodie — but it ships as score legs and dark artifacts, not as a *read*. Five engines compute group participation nightly with zero or partial UI. The product gaps are: activity-participation axis, sign-agreement, episode ledger, outside confirmation at basket grain, per-basket earnings status, and the assembled per-basket READ surface.

## §2 Anti-duplication map (extend these; build nothing parallel)

| Existing organ | Role in this program |
|---|---|
| `engine/theme_scoring._breadth_leg` | Trend-participation input (reuse output, do not recompute) |
| `engine/basket_breadth_divergence.py` | Participation-crack / stealth-deterioration input (currently DARK — GR1 lights it) |
| `engine/group_flow.py` | Cohesion/broadening/leadership + cluster map input (DARK — GR1 lights it); sign-agreement % lands HERE as a new field, not a new module |
| `engine/coiled.py` (`washout_ctx`) | Per-member capitulation leg (gauntlet-passed); extended to expose capitulation date/age |
| `engine/cycles.py` (`cycle_state`) | Days-since-low per member |
| `engine/sector_bottom.member_breadth` | List-agnostic member aggregation shape (washed_out_share/turning_share) |
| `engine/basket_turn_watch.py` / `basket_turn_cohort.py` | K-of-N turn confluence + qledger grading (unchanged; pulse LINKS to its read) |
| `engine/weinstein_stage.py` + `engine/stage_flows.py` | Stage share per basket (stage2_share/stage4_share) |
| `engine/guidance_gap.py` | Guidance-direction rollup pattern (generalized 18 themes → 48 baskets, ≥2-filer law preserved) |
| `engine/theme_revisions.py` | Revision-breadth rollup pattern (same generalization) |
| `collectors/equity_earnings.py` / `edgar_eps.py` | Beat-rate + report-date inputs |
| `engine/earnings_release/` (figures, binding) | Per-event structured figures for beat/guide classification |
| `collectors/issuer_evidence.py` + `engine/government_revenue/issuer_graph_expansion.py` | Relationship-graph machinery to generalize for outside confirmation (GR3) |
| `templates/basket_detail.html.j2` + `templates/baskets.html.j2` + `_baskets_desk.html.j2` | THE surfaces. No new page family (DNR:KILL-ROTATION-SCHEDULE analog: no parallel surface) |
| `engine/ai_desk.py` | May NARRATE from pulse artifacts (A7: de-escalate only, never originate) |

## §3 Inherited rulings (binding)

- **DNR:KILL-PSS-SR3-PARTICIPATION** — participation-recovery as a directional/timing signal is killed. Group Reads ships participation as *description*, never as a buy/sell read.
- **DNR:KILL-PSS-SR2-PEER-DIFFUSION**, **DNR:KILL-RS-DISPERSION-GATES** — no peer-diffusion bottom-timing, no RS-based dispersion gates.
- **DNR:HOLD-PSS-CD1-CROWDING** — co-movement/dispersion overlays accrue prospectively; no authority.
- **DNR:KILL-ROTATION-SCHEDULE** — rotation context folds into Turn Desk artifacts; no parallel rotation surface.
- **DNR:HOLD-IGNITION-SURFACES** — no "igniting" claims; arc states are descriptive with honest nulls.
- **R-TIL-3** — no fused cross-basket number. **R-TIL-9** — new evidence lands into existing organs.
- **Oracle P8 null** — sector-grain washout→turn printed NULL standalone; all arc reads disclose this in Tier-2.
- **Company Event docket §0.2** — LLMs extract/de-escalate only; residual-theme constructs reach Prophet/Neural Web only via point-in-time accrual + pre-registered promotion.

## §4 Frozen contracts

### 4.1 `group_pulse.v1` (per basket, nightly; `site/basketdata/pulse.json`, one object per basket_id)

  "coverage_warnings": ["..."]
}
```

Arc `state` ladder (deterministic, disclosed; evaluated in order, first match wins; floors: `n_covered ≥ 5` and `n_covered/n_members ≥ 0.6`, else `state: "insufficient_coverage"`):
1. `washout_in_progress` — washed_out_share ≥ 0.5 AND capitulation_median_age_d ≤ 5
2. `washout_complete_awaiting_reclaim` — washed_out_share ≥ 0.5 AND age > 5 AND reclaimed_20d_share < 0.5
3. `turning` — washed_out_share ≥ 0.5 AND reclaimed_20d_share ≥ 0.5
4. `advancing` — stage2_share ≥ 0.5 AND trend_share_50d ≥ 0.6
5. `distributing` — stage4_share ≥ 0.4 AND trend_share_50d < 0.5
6. `quiet` — otherwise

### 4.2 Episode ledger (`data/group_pulse/episodes.parquet`, append-only, nightly-advanced)

Columns: `basket_id, episode_id, start_date, end_date (null while open), sessions_active, sessions_span, members_ever_active, members_persisted, persistence_share, closed (bool), advanced_at`.
Rules (disclosed on-surface): a basket-day is ACTIVE when `activity_share ≥ 0.5` and `activity_n ≥ 3`; an episode joins active days separated by ≤ 2 inactive sessions; an episode closes after 3 consecutive inactive sessions; hysteresis exit threshold 0.35. `persistence_share` = members active in every active session ÷ members active in ≥ 1 session. Provisional current-episode rows are recomputed until `closed`; closed rows are immutable (provisional-bucket law: a closed row is never edited by a later advance).

`activity` per member-day: |SPY-adjusted return| z ≥ 1.5 vs own trailing 63d, OR volume ratio ≥ 1.5× own 63d median (missing volume → return leg only, disclosed via `activity_basis` count fields).

### 4.3 `group_earnings_pulse.v1` (per basket, nightly; `site/basketdata/earnings_pulse.json`)

```json
{
  "schema": "group_earnings_pulse.v1", "authority": "context_only",
  "basket_id": "ai_infra", "as_of": "2026-08-07",
  "season": {"n_members": 14, "n_reported": 9, "n_upcoming_14d": 3, "next": [{"ticker": "...", "date": "...", "session": "amc"}]},
  "results": {"n_beat": 7, "n_miss": 2, "n_inline": 0, "n_no_data": 5, "beat_basis": "eps_surprise; floor n_reported>=4"},
  "guidance": {"band": "RAISING|NEUTRAL|CUTTING|BROAD-RAISE|null", "n_filers": 3, "basis": "guidance_gap generalized; >=2 distinct filers else null"},
  "revisions": {"net_up_share": 0.58, "n_covered": 11},
  "drift": {"pos_share_5d": 0.67, "n": 9},
  "sympathy": {"ratio": 1.8, "n_events": 22, "window_q": 8, "basis": "median |SPY-adj move| of non-reporters on member report days ÷ their unconditional baseline; floors: >=4 members with >=4 events",
               "directional": {"beat_day_median": 0.004, "miss_day_median": -0.006, "n_beat_days": 14, "n_miss_days": 8}}
}
```

`sympathy.ratio` is THE "do earnings move together in this basket" stat. It ships with N everywhere, floors enforced, null below floor.

### 4.4 `group_linked_outsiders.v1` (per basket, nightly; `site/basketdata/linked_outsiders.json`)

FROZEN 2026-08-08 at GR3 build, exactly as shipped in `engine/group_linked_outsiders.py`.
One object per basket_id; a basket with no edges still gets an object with `outsiders: []`.

```json
{
  "schema": "group_linked_outsiders.v1", "authority": "context_only",
  "generated_at": "<iso8601>", "basket_id": "ai_infra", "as_of": "2026-08-07",
  "n_outsiders": 8, "n_confirming": 2, "n_with_tape": 7,
  "edge_window_months": 24,
  "outsiders": [
    {"ticker": "TSM", "name": "<registrant name>",
     "linked_members": [{"member": "NVDA", "relationship": "supply_agreement",
                         "filed_at": "YYYY-MM-DD", "accession": "...", "form": "8-K", "item": "1.01"}],
     "edge_n": 2, "last_filed_at": "YYYY-MM-DD",
     "state": "confirming|active_divergent|quiet|unavailable",
     "move_spy_adj": 0.012, "active": true}
  ],
  "basis": "counterparties disclosed in 8-K Item 1.01/2.03 material-agreement filings within 24 months, resolved by unique near-verbatim registrant-name match; states describe today's tape, not a forecast",
  "coverage_warnings": []
}
```

Unknown keys are contract violations (G0-1); every count carries its n.

**HONESTY RULING (binding on this and every later wave).** We publish the agreement
type the filing actually discloses and nothing more. The relationship vocabulary is
CLOSED — `supply_agreement`, `purchase_agreement`, `collaboration`, `license`,
`financing`, `merger_related`, `disclosed_agreement` — and the words **customer,
supplier, partner, competitor are banned** at every tier, in the artifact and on any
surface built from it. An 8-K Item 1.01 grounds that two companies signed an
agreement; it does not ground which side is the customer. Jodie.ai's "outside
confirmation" asserts those roles; we decline to, and say why on the surface. A
CI-registered test asserts the emitted vocabulary carries none of the four words.

**EDGE ADMISSION.** An 8-K row is a candidate when its `items` names Item 1.01 or
2.03, `filing_date` falls within the trailing 24 months of `as_of`, `counterparty`
is non-empty, and the filer is an active member of ≥1 basket. Both directions count
— an outsider's own 8-K naming a member creates the same edge whenever that filer
itself resolves to a member.

**RESOLVER (strict; no scorer exists to loosen).** `normalize_legal_name`,
`strip_legal_suffix`, and `name_match_tier` are IMPORTED from
`engine.government_revenue.issuer_graph_expansion`, never forked. Registrant names
come from the committed SEC company_tickers snapshot at
`data/symbol_directory/cik_map/<YYYY-MM-DD>.parquet` (newest by filename date).
Admission is exactly the govrev tiering: verbatim, or a one-sided legal-suffix
difference. No substring, no edit distance, no abbreviation guessing. Exactly one
surviving registrant ticker → admitted; more than one → `ambiguous_tie`; none →
`no_registrant_match`; the filer itself → `self_reference`. Every rejection is
written to the ledger with its reason — a candidate is never silently dropped.
Known cost of strictness, accepted: a dual-class registrant whose tickers share one
title (GOOGL/GOOG → "Alphabet Inc.") rejects as `ambiguous_tie`, and two different
legal designators on one core ("… Company Ltd." vs "… CO LTD") do not match. Both
are refusals to guess, not defects.

**RELATIONSHIP SUBTYPE.** Deterministic keyword rules over the row's agreement text,
evaluated in a fixed order (merger_related → financing → license → collaboration →
supply_agreement → purchase_agreement), then the item-code fallback (Item 2.03
without 1.01 → `financing`), else `disclosed_agreement`. Order is load-bearing: a
merger agreement mentions "purchase". The full table lives in the module docstring.

**OUTSIDER SET.** Resolved counterparties linked by ≥1 admitted edge to ≥1 active
member of that basket, minus the basket's own members; ordered by (edge_n desc,
last_filed_at desc, ticker asc) and capped at 12, with the pre-cap count disclosed in
`coverage_warnings` whenever the cap binds. No silent truncation.

**STATE (a description of today's tape, never a forecast).** `active` mirrors §4.2's
member-activity rule and imports group_pulse's constants when that module is present
(z ≥ 1.5 vs own trailing 63 sessions, OR volume ≥ 1.5× own 63-session median).
Basket sign comes from `pulse.json` written earlier in the same run.
`confirming` = active AND sign(move_spy_adj) == basket sign AND sign ≠ "mixed";
`active_divergent` = active otherwise (including every active outsider of a mixed
basket); `quiet` = tape readable, not active; `unavailable` = no usable tape, or no
basket direction. An outsider with no tape STAYS LISTED — the disclosed relationship
is a fact independent of whether the ticker prints today. A tape whose newest bar is
>7 calendar days stale reads `unavailable`, never `quiet`: a delisted name must not
publish an old session's move as today's. A missing `pulse.json` degrades every state
to `unavailable` with a coverage warning and never crashes the nightly.

**EDGE LEDGER** — `data/group_pulse/linked_outsider_edges.parquet`, append-only,
advanced only in the nightly lane (`engine.ledger_lane.nightly_advance_enabled`).
Columns: `member_ticker, outsider_ticker, relationship, accession, form, item,
filed_at, extracted_name_raw, admitted, reject_reason, advanced_at`. Rows are facts
and immutable once written; a re-run over identical inputs appends nothing and leaves
the file byte-identical (G0-4).

**MEASURED SOURCE YIELD AT FREEZE (2026-08-08) — the wave ships INERT.** The
committed `data/edgar/material_8k_events.parquet` holds 50,667 rows, 9,343 with Item
1.01/2.03, 1,972 of those inside the 24-month window — and **0 with a non-null
`counterparty`**, across every committed revision back to 2026-07-31. So every basket
publishes `outsiders: []` today, with the reason stated in `coverage_warnings` rather
than an unexplained empty list. The cause is upstream and structural, not a defect in
this engine: `collectors/edgar_8k.enrich_contract_amounts` computes
`counterparty = _parse_counterparty(text) if ok else None`, so a counterparty is only
extracted from a filing whose primary document ALSO yielded a parseable dollar amount
— and all 207 filings the enrichment lane has read recorded `extraction_ok=False`,
because material-agreement 8-Ks routinely put the dollar figure in an EX-10 exhibit
the primary-document fetch never reads. **GR3b (not in this wave):** ungate the name
leg from the dollar leg and extend the fetch to exhibits. The engine, the resolver,
and the ledger are proven against synthetic fixtures and against the real registrant
snapshot, so the artifact fills in with no rule change the night the column populates.

## §5 Waves

**GR0 — group pulse plane** (opus builder, fresh worktree): `engine/group_pulse.py` assembler + episode ledger + `coiled.washout_ctx` date-exposure extension + capitulation→20dma-reclaim pairing primitive + sign-agreement field added to `group_flow.py` + nightly wiring + tests + CI registration. US 48 baskets. Gates: G0-1..6, G0-10.

**GR1 — Basket Read surfaces** (designer/opus after GR0+GR2 PRs exist): upgrade `basket_detail.html.j2` with a top READ band — plain-word stance line; four tiles (Participation / Direction / Arc / Earnings); "What we're watching" strengthens/weakens conditions; "Has this happened before" episode section; member table separating unusual-activity from direction. Upgrade `baskets.html.j2` board with state/change chips + disclosed ordering rule (state-change first, then activity_share, then agreement; rule printed on page). Gates: G0-2, G0-3, G0-7, G0-8, G0-9. Falsifier language backstage per operator law.

**GR2 — group earnings pulse** (opus builder, parallel with GR0): `engine/group_earnings.py` per §4.3 — clock, beat rollup, guidance generalization, revision breadth, drift, sympathy ledger (`data/group_pulse/sympathy.parquet`, nightly-advanced, append-only closed rows). Tests + CI registration. Gates: G0-1, G0-3, G0-4, G0-5, G0-6, G0-10.

**GR3 — outside confirmation** (BUILT 2026-08-08, `engine/group_linked_outsiders.py`): generalize issuer-evidence relationship extraction beyond govrev scope; per-basket filing-linked outsiders with confirm/not-confirm state + receipts. Off-render-path collection; nightly join only. Contract `group_linked_outsiders.v1` FROZEN at §4.4 — including the honesty ruling (disclosed agreement types, never an inferred Customer/Supplier label) and the measured source-yield finding: the wave ships inert because the collector's `counterparty` column is empty, and **GR3b** must ungate the name leg from the dollar leg in `collectors/edgar_8k.py` before this surface carries anything.

**GR4 — radar/rotation integration + zh sweep + glossary**: fold basket state-change events into Turn Desk artifacts (no parallel surface); `docs/site_semantics/` glossary rows for every new stat; regional twins (CN/HK) after US proves.

Sequencing: GR0 ∥ GR2 now → GR1 on their real schemas → GR3/GR4. GR0 and GR2 touch disjoint files (`group_pulse.py`+`group_flow.py`+`coiled.py` vs `group_earnings.py`); no shared-file collisions.

## §6 Promotion path (later, not now)

Everything display/context tier. IF the operator later wants authority (e.g., arc state as a Prophet confluence input), the path is: point-in-time accrual from ledgers (already append-only), pre-registered gates, its own gauntlet — same bar as `basket_turn_cohort` (promotion question not before 2027). Nothing in GR0-4 pre-commits to promotion.

## §7 Competitive rubric pointer

The operator's post-build audit ("does this beat Jodie/Struct/Quartr/EarningsCall.ai/EquityDesk individually") grades this program on: read assembly quality, membership hygiene vs Jodie's noise, arc answers Jodie lacks, earnings integration Jodie lacks, honest-null discipline, bilingual reach. Rubric doc to be written at audit time.
