# Intelligence Evaluation OS — Recovery Capability Ledger + Architecture Freeze

**Status:** CEO architecture freeze / records-only  
**Chairman intent:** end-to-end CEO ownership of Intelligence Evaluation OS until measurement, health, promotion law and evidence clocks are complete and proven in real use.  
**Recovered:** 2026-08-27 America/New_York / 2026-08-28 UTC  
**Protected Sol Skillpack (final revalidation):** `mastermindx-market-intelligence/Mastermind@7fbc37cdd47d7ee5bb77f07aef1d00db4f858cfa` (`mastermind.sol_skillpack.v1`, v1.0.0, bootstrap-major 1)  
**Macro freeze base:** `d84468e41f40f8dfb2404b2f51be557aade8f0ec`

This record supersedes stale *next actions* in the 2026-08-14 Eval OS workstream/handoff records. It does not erase their evidence or change historical rulings. It creates no runtime, score, monitor, registry, promotion authority or generated state.

## 1. Outcome and completion law

Evaluation OS exists to make one answer defensible: **which Mastermind intelligence outputs are working, what exactly was measured, on what clock/ruler, and what authority may that evidence lawfully support?**

Completion is not “the library exists”, a merged PR, a green CI run, or a Slack delivery. Complete means real producers register claims prospectively, real grading runs mature those claims under their declared clocks, illegal readings/promotions fail closed, operators can see output health and evidence status in the existing admin surface, the original T0–T12 program has an explicit evidence-backed disposition, and no second evaluation/control plane was created.

## 2. Recovered capability ledger — complete original T0–T12 disposition

| Capability | State | Recovered truth |
|---|---|---|
| T0 metric-validity substrate | `PARTIAL` | #5471 landed the auditor and core invariants, but `scripts/check_qledger_metric_validity.py` remains WARN-tier by default; T3 hardening is not complete. |
| T1 canonical engine registry | `PROVEN_LIVE` for its bounded registry/guard law | #5620 / `d13259abc51c` landed the derived `producer::owner_program` registry, fail-closed integrity guard and isolated CI. W3 curated 107/109 output classes with two deliberate nulls. Agent OS and Linear MAS-131 were later reconciled to `done`. |
| T2 Prophet plan-ledger benchmark / MFE / MAE | `NOT_BUILT` under the original contract | Current `data/prophet/ledger.jsonl` and `research/PROPHET_LEDGER_SCHEMA.md` remain `prophet.ledger/v1` without `bench_ret_pct`, `sector_ret_pct`, signed benchmark/sector excess, MFE or MAE fields. Newer Prophet evaluation/arena programs now exist, so the old T2 shape must be reconciled against current Prophet-owned architecture before any implementation; do not create a parallel Prophet evaluation ledger. |
| T3 retire invalid emitters + strict metric-validity gate | `PARTIAL` | Direction/control/output-class legality fixes exist (#5519/#5572/#5573 and later clock work), but the top-level metric-validity gate still deliberately exits warn-tier by default. |
| T4 per-output health resolver | `BUILT_NOT_PROVEN` | Old branch is gone. #5721 merged as `a77d874a1c23c7e4e2db0000db75164fcc56bcc2` after adversarial HOLD/fixes. Health is derived on demand over T1 + Synapse + existing evidence providers; no generated health state. Real deployed admin proof is still missing. |
| T5 failure taxonomy + clustering | `NOT_BUILT` | The required failure classes (`stale_feature`, `data_issue`, `false_breakout`, `unclassified`, etc.) are present in plans/specification only; no implemented deterministic T5 taxonomy/clusterer was found. It remains dependent on T2 or its lawfully superseding Prophet evidence contract. |
| T6 Golden Case Library | `PARTIAL` | The pre-existing `engine/neuralweb/eval/` estate still contains one benchmark case (`benchmark_bear_steepener_2026-07-29.json`); the planned 20-case PIT library under `data/golden_cases/` does not exist. Extend the existing eval harness rather than creating a second replay framework. |
| T7 per-engine evidence scorecard | `NOT_BUILT` | The required Validated/Accruing/Ungraded/Degraded/Disproven semantics remain architecture/plan text, not implementation. |
| T8 global CEO evidence view | `NOT_BUILT` | Still plan/spec. It must rank by evidence strength and show empty/negative states honestly. |
| T9 qledger adoption / real evidence accrual | `PARTIAL` | qledger is active at scale, but focal desk adoption is incomplete and the original “every directional engine” adoption law has not been proven. |
| T10 contradiction classification addition | `NOT_BUILT` as the Eval-OS addition | The pre-existing contradiction detector remains canonical; Eval OS must not rebuild it. The planned healthy-tension / impossible-contradiction classification extension is not proven implemented. |
| T11 deterministic numeric-source verification | `NOT_BUILT` as the planned addition | Existing response-eval rubric remains canonical and must not be replaced; deterministic number-to-source verification is still a separate missing layer. |
| T12 Agent OS tier interface | `NOT_BUILT` | `required_tier(diff)` is found only in the V1 plan. Eval OS may state required evidence tier; Agent OS remains the router/owner of work. |

### Cross-cutting measurement / operational substrate recovered outside a single T-number

| Capability | State | Recovered truth |
|---|---|---|
| Qledger horizon-unit + market-ruler law | `PROVEN_LIVE` on qledger path | Explicit `trading_days` / `calendar_days`, market resolution, maturity/check-by/grading window and rendered ruler are resolved centrally for qledger claims. Current production track record emits clock-basis metadata. |
| Cross-clock pooling refusal | `PROVEN_LIVE` on current qledger track-record path | Current `site/qledger/track_record.json` selects a single legal basis and emits `pooling_refused: true` where legacy and explicit bases coexist. |
| Append-only assertion law | `PROVEN_LIVE` for repository guard law | #5534 merged; stale Agent OS text still said to merge it before this reconciliation. |
| Forward-only desk adapters | `PARTIAL` | #5577 merged adapters for `stock_desk`, `thematic_desk`, `demand_chain`; actual clock evidence proves only `demand_chain` began prospective accrual. |
| General forward evidence clock | `PARTIAL` | `demand_chain` started `2026-08-19T08:10:37.995754+00:00`, 126 trading days, trigger git SHA `34899ec5235884e183be86088ab01f81e34a693f`. No current tracked clock exists for `stock_desk` or `thematic_desk`. No backfill is permitted. |
| Legacy evidence promotion firewall | `BUILT_NOT_PROVEN` as a complete end-to-end authority refusal | #5584 prevents legacy-clock evidence from originating new authority after the clock discontinuity and forbids mixing legacy with explicit evidence. It still needs one unified adversarial/consumer proof on the final path. |
| CEO control-leg policy | `PARTIAL` in live accrual, **decision resolved** | P0d/#5609 established benchmark universal baseline; matched control only where a defensible counterfactual exists. `stock_desk` and `demand_chain` are matched-control-required; `thematic_desk` is benchmark-only. #5665/#5672 repaired demand-chain wiring and replay clock consistency. |
| Matched-control evidence clock | `PARTIAL` | Historical production receipt proves `demand_chain` started `2026-08-19T08:10:37.332100+00:00`, control `XLU`, 126 trading days. #5970 then correctly untracked/ignored control-clock files because the canonical file is runner-local/write-once. Current runner-local persistence must be verified on the production host; no second persisted copy may be invented. `stock_desk` has no proven start. |
| Promotion readiness consumer | `PARTIAL` | Current qledger nightly runs and emits readiness; 2026-08-27 production `run_status.json` reports 1,250 grades that run, zero promotion-ready families, and `radar@21d` approaching. Readiness remains advisory; existing authority/promotion owners remain canonical. |
| Existing admin Intelligence OS health page | `BUILT_NOT_PROVEN` | #5721 added read-only admin routes/page, in-memory cache only. No accepted production-browser/operator receipt was found. |
| Executive OS current-state read / CEO admission from Personal-Pro | `DARK_OR_DISCONNECTED` for this session | C1 implementation #155 merged in Mastermind, and the Relay bot has joined `#sol-runtime`, but no `MMX/SOL_STATE_V1` frame exists yet. No current Executive Job/Attempt/Worker state can be canonically read, and no Executive modifying admission may be assumed. |

### Current qledger production evidence

At the recovery base, `data/qledger/run_status.json` is a real active-run artifact (`as_of: 2026-08-27`): 68,291 open, 1,250 graded in the run, 37,014 blocked by coverage, 4 ungradeable, 83,568 already graded; 14 claims are clock-unresolvable and are disclosed rather than guessed. Readiness reports zero families ready. This proves the grading plane is alive; it does **not** prove Evaluation OS complete.

## 3. Stale records and carriers

1. `WS:EVAL-OS-MEASUREMENT-LAW` W4 still said “merge #5534/#5577/P0c-2”; all are already merged. Its W5 still said control-leg CEO ruling was unresolved; P0d/#5609 and the preregistered control contract already resolved it.
2. `WS:EVAL-OS-OUTPUT-HEALTH` still said T4 was on `claude/eval-os-t4-output-health` awaiting adversarial review/PR. That branch no longer exists; #5721 merged on 2026-08-15 after adversarial review and repair.
3. T1 continuation material from 2026-08-12/14 is historical archaeology only. T1 itself was later reconciled to done by #6392 / MAS-131.
4. #5512’s recommendation to defer T7/T8 because the validated list would be nearly empty was a then-current planning judgment, not a permanent prohibition. An honest L4 must be useful precisely when Validated is empty and Accruing/Degraded dominate.
5. The old T2/T5/T6 plan items were never made terminal merely because newer Prophet/Neural-Web work landed elsewhere. Their exact old implementations must not be blindly resumed; each must first reconcile to the current owner and either close the original capability gap or record an explicit evidence-backed replacement/rejection.
6. No current Eval OS implementation PR or Slack carrier was found at recovery. Never revive an old branch name as a carrier.

## 4. CEO rulings — frozen

### R1 — one ruler means one declared claim clock

A claim’s evaluation identity includes its declared horizon value, horizon unit and resolved market calendar. Qledger’s resolver is canonical for qledger claims. `check_by`, maturity, grade window and displayed ruler must come from that contract; no caller may silently substitute calendar days for trading days or another market’s session calendar.

The existing 5/21/63 grade ladder remains binding. A claim declared beyond 63 sessions (for example `demand_chain` at 126 trading days) may have a 126-day check-by but does **not** gain an own-horizon grade merely because 5/21/63 grades exist. Do not extend the ladder in this program without a separate explicit ruling.

### R2 — clock bases never launder into one sample

`legacy_calendar_unstamped` and `explicit_unit_v1` are different evidence bases. Explicit bases further distinguish horizon unit and market. Mixed bases may be displayed side-by-side but never pooled into one promotion statistic. Legacy evidence may remain visible historically but cannot originate post-discontinuity authority; explicit evidence must independently satisfy the gate.

### R3 — control policy is resolved

Benchmark-relative evidence is the universal baseline. A matched-control leg is required only for families whose governed policy says a defensible matched counterfactual exists. Current required families are `stock_desk` and `demand_chain`; `thematic_desk` is benchmark-only. Missing/unpriceable required controls reduce coverage and cannot silently fall out of the denominator. Policy is governed by the one existing qledger policy table; it may never be inferred from which rows happen to contain controls.

### R4 — runner-local control clocks stay runner-local

#5970 is correct. `data/qledger/control_evidence_clock_start/` is a write-once operational clock, not a Git-tracked knowledge store. Do not solve observability by committing another canonical copy. Admin/diagnostic views may read and render the same operational source or a non-authoritative receipt, but only the write-once runtime clock decides cohort membership.

### R5 — no new promotion authority

Qledger promotion/readiness calculations remain measurement/advisory evidence. Existing canonical lifecycle/authority owners (`config/qual_ladder.yml`, species/prereg/gauntlet laws and their governed consumers) remain the authority plane. Eval OS may refuse an illegal measurement from supporting promotion; it does not create another promotion database/service.

### R6 — output health is a view, not a monitor

T4 remains pure/derived over T1, Synapse and existing evidence providers. No committed health artifact, second freshness registry, watchdog, graph, dead-man switch or health score store. `could_not_look` is a first-class assessment result and never becomes healthy/neutral.

### R7 — L4 uses the existing admin Intelligence OS surface

T7/T8 extend the existing read-only Intelligence OS admin page/API. They do not create a second admin product or score store. Per-engine metrics are selected by T1 `output_class`; null class stays null. “Cannot claim yet” must carry the same visual weight as positive evidence.

### R8 — Eval OS does not route work

T12 may deterministically derive the evidence/review tier required by a changed engine/authority surface and emit a structured finding. Agent OS owns durable workstreams and routing. Eval OS does not create a queue, worker lifecycle or priority authority.

### R9 — evidence-clock time is registration time, never thesis time

The general and matched-control evidence clocks measure the first **accepted prospective registration event** on their governed paths. The clock timestamp is generated by that registration event and must be causally linked to the exact accepted claim/trigger row. It is not copied from `state_asof`, claim `asof`, thesis creation time, a historical source timestamp, this architecture document or an operator-supplied backdate. The claim’s own as-of may legitimately precede registration only if the shared forward gate proves that no bar in the graded outcome window has printed yet. This distinction is load-bearing: using a historical thesis timestamp as the evidence-clock start would make a new forward cohort look older than it actually is.

### R10 — original T0–T12 tasks cannot disappear by drift

A newer subsystem may supersede the **implementation shape** of an old Eval OS task, but not silently erase its user/machine capability. For T2/T5/T6/T10/T11, a Fable wave must first reconcile the old objective against the current Prophet/Metabolism/Neural-Web/contradiction/response-eval owners. If a current owner already satisfies the objective, prove it and record the replacement. If not, extend that canonical owner. Never resurrect an old plan into a duplicate evaluation ledger, replay framework, taxonomy store, contradiction detector or rubric.

## 5. Architecture freeze — canonical flow

```

T2/T5 remain Prophet-owner extensions, T6 extends the existing Neural Web eval harness, T10 extends the existing contradiction detector, and T11 extends the existing response-eval system. They feed evidence upward but do not create parallel truth stores.

**Forbidden forks:** second engine registry; second claims/grades store; second health monitor/store; second promotion authority; hand-maintained score database; retrospective “prospective” rows; new hidden clock store; second Prophet evaluation ledger; second replay/golden-case framework; second contradiction detector; second generative rubric; a public/internal score that pools different clock bases.

## 6. Completion map / bounded waves

### E1 — Real desk clock recovery and accrual proof — first critical path

Observable mission: a real scheduled/production run causes `stock_desk` and `thematic_desk` to register truly prospective claims and mint their first general evidence clocks; `stock_desk` also starts its matched-control evidence clock if and only if the first valid controlled prospective claim exists; `demand_chain` current runner-local control-clock state is verified without recreating it.

Non-goals: no retrospective rows, no backfilled flag, no clock timestamp copied from a historical thesis/claim timestamp or this document, no qledger redesign, no grade-ladder extension, no authority change.

Proof: exact trigger rows/accepted claim IDs; clock timestamps created by the first accepted registration events and causally linked to those claims; the next real grading run sees them under the correct basis; and negative proof that pre-clock rows cannot enter the new authority cohort.

### H1 — T4 deployed/admin proof and blindness census — may run in parallel with E1

Observable mission: exact merged T4 code is verified on the real deployed admin path and real Synapse estate; operator sees healthy/degraded/stale/unavailable/could_not_look states, output-class nulls and dependency bounds without persisted health state.

Non-goals: no monitor, no scorecard authority, no T7/T8 performance ranking yet, no healing source declarations inside the proof wave unless a specific declaration defect prevents truthful rendering.

Proof: browser/API receipt on production, real artifact census, representative degraded/blind/unavailable cases, and fixture/reflection controls on the exact implementation head/release.

### P1 — Unified promotion/clock-laundering adversarial acceptance — after E1 qledger-path changes settle

Observable mission: one acceptance suite demonstrates that illegal promotion evidence fails closed through the real readiness/consumer path, not merely inside helper functions.

Required mutations: legacy evidence treated as new authority; explicit+legacy pooling; unit/market basis stripped; 126d check-by mislabeled as own-horizon verdict; retrospective registration; evidence clock backdated to thesis/claim `asof`; control policy inferred from row availability; missing/unpriceable required control removed from denominator; replay maturity using wall clock; direction sign erased/pooled.

No new promotion authority or score store.

### A1 — T7 per-engine evidence scorecards + T8 CEO view — after H1, may consume E1 accrual state honestly

Observable mission: the existing admin Intelligence OS answers which engines are Validated, Accruing, Ungraded by design, Degraded, or Disproven, with per-engine evidence selected by output class and all claims linked to their legal ruler/basis.

The Validated list is allowed to be empty. Empty is evidence, not a product failure. Ranking is by evidence strength, never headline performance.

### G1 — T3 metric-validity strict promotion

Only after invalid live emitters/readers are repaired or explicitly exempted under source law: flip the existing metric-validity gate from fleet-wide warning to a real hard integrity gate. No performance threshold becomes a hard release gate merely because this wave exists.

### Q1 — T9 fleet adoption completion

After E1/P1 establish the final clock/promotion contract, census every T1 engine whose `output_class` makes forward grading applicable and either wire it through its existing canonical owner/ledger or record `ungraded_by_design` with evidence. Do not force classification/detection/salience outputs into directional-return metrics.

### V1 — T2 current-Prophet evidence reconciliation

Before implementing the old T2 file list, cold-start the current Prophet evaluation authority (including Conditional Fusion/Arena and the forward plan ledger). Prove whether benchmark-relative return, sector-relative return, MFE and MAE already exist under a newer canonical contract. If they do, map T2 to that evidence. If not, extend the existing Prophet owner and its sole forward ledger/read model. Do not create another Prophet ledger or backfill an apparently forward record without an explicit current evidence law.

### F1 — T5 failure taxonomy / clustering — after V1 or its proven replacement

Extend the existing Metabolism/postmortem path with a deterministic closed vocabulary that evaluates `stale_feature` and `data_issue` first, preserves an honest `unclassified` bucket, and clusters only after the underlying evidence contract can support the named failure (including MFE/MAE-dependent `false_breakout`). No free-standing taxonomy truth store.

### C1 — T6 Golden Case Library

Grow the existing Neural Web eval harness from its single benchmark case to the planned PIT-curated library. Each case must carry knowable-at inputs, expected reading, known failure modes and deterministic replay. Reuse existing replay/eval primitives; do not create a second replay framework. Curated expected readings are main-loop/Fable judgement, not mechanical labels.

### R1 — T10/T11 reliability extensions

Extend the existing contradiction detector with the healthy-tension/impossible-contradiction classification and the existing response-eval system with deterministic numeric-to-source verification. Neither may create a replacement detector/rubric.

### I1 — T12 narrow Agent OS evidence-tier interface

After T1/T4/L4 contracts are stable: implement the planned derived `required_tier` interface and structured finding. It may never route/prioritize work itself.

E1 and H1 are the first commissions because they resolve real-use truth on the critical measurement/observability path and have disjoint expected write surfaces. V1/F1/C1/R1/I1 remain owned backlog, not forgotten future work; they may fan later only after collision/owner reconciliation.

## 7. Definition of `PROVEN_LIVE` for Evaluation OS

The **program**, not just a component, may be called `PROVEN_LIVE` only when all of the following are true on current accepted production code:

1. **Truthful clocks:** at least the focal `stock_desk`, `thematic_desk`, and `demand_chain` producers have real prospective start receipts created by their first accepted registration events on real runs; every required matched-control family has a real control-clock start or an explicit truthful “not started” state. Each receipt is causally linked to the accepted claim that started it, and no clock is backdated to a thesis/claim as-of or otherwise retrospectively decorated.
2. **Correct grading:** real matured claims are graded using their declared unit/market ruler and one shared subject/benchmark/control window; >63 declared horizons are not mislabeled as own-horizon grades under the unchanged ladder.
3. **Basis integrity:** production track record/readiness never pools legacy with explicit evidence or different explicit market/unit bases. A deliberately mutated laundering path fails the acceptance suite.
4. **Promotion legality:** no new authority can originate from legacy-only, mixed-basis, insufficient-date, illegal-control or otherwise ineligible evidence. Promotion readiness and the actual authority owner agree on what the evidence may support.
5. **Real health:** T4 is exercised against the deployed real estate and visible in the existing admin console, including a real negative/blind state; no generated health store exists.
6. **Human answer layer:** T7/T8 are visible in that same admin surface and truthfully separate Validated / Accruing / Ungraded-by-design / Degraded / Disproven, including empty and null states.
7. **Adversarial proof:** exact final-head tests kill clock-basis laundering, retrospective clock creation/backdating and illegal promotion mutations; independent adversarial review finds no duplicate authority/control plane.
8. **Operational proof:** at least one subsequent real scheduled run advances claims/grades while preserving the same laws, and operator observability remains correct after that run.
9. **Fleet adoption honesty:** T9 has a current T1-based census; gradeable outputs are enrolled through existing owners and non-gradeable outputs are explicitly `ungraded_by_design`, not silently absent.
10. **Original-plan closure:** T0–T12 all have terminal, evidence-backed dispositions. T2/T5/T6/T10/T11/T12 may be satisfied by a proven newer canonical owner only when the supersession/replacement is explicit; none may remain `NOT_BUILT`/`PARTIAL` simply because later programs moved elsewhere.
11. **No duplicate system:** zero second engine registry, claims ledger, health monitor/store, promotion authority, work queue, hidden evidence-clock database, Prophet evaluation ledger, replay framework, contradiction detector or response-eval rubric.
12. **Durable reconciliation:** Agent OS, GitHub evidence and Linear projection all state the same terminal truth; Slack receipts are treated only as transport; Executive OS state is referenced only when its canonical production read is actually available.

Until then, the overall program remains `PARTIAL` even when individual substrate capabilities are `PROVEN_LIVE`.

## 8. Exact continuation

Freeze this architecture first. Then dispatch **E1** and **H1** to separate Fable COO main-loop carriers because their expected changed paths are disjoint. A Slack delivery is not execution: each carrier must return an explicit same-thread Fable ACK before its wave is considered started. If no main-loop Fable session ACKs, record `DELIVERY_ONLY / MANUAL_PICKUP_REQUIRED` and do not fabricate runtime execution.

P1 is held until E1’s qledger-path movement is returned/reconciled. A1 is held until H1 production truth is known. G1/Q1/V1/F1/C1/R1/I1 remain owned downstream waves and require fresh owner/collision checks at dispatch. Sol reviews every returned PR/proof against this freeze and remains final acceptance owner.
