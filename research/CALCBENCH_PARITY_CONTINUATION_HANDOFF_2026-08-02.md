# Calcbench parity continuation handoff — 2026-08-02

## 2026-08-03 B4F continuation note

Wave 3A remains the accepted receipt-kernel baseline described below. The
current follow-on is **B4F: one controlled AAPL first-issuer pilot**, documented
canonically in
`research/CALCBENCH_PARITY_WAVE_3B_B4F_FIRST_SEALED_ISSUER_PILOT_2026-08-03.md`.

Current truth, deliberately narrow:

- The operator created a dedicated normal-access R2 bucket. B4F now requires
  its own repository bindings: `R2_ATTESTED_HISTORY_ENDPOINT`,
  `R2_ATTESTED_HISTORY_BUCKET`,
  `R2_ATTESTED_HISTORY_READONLY_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and
  `R2_ATTESTED_HISTORY_READONLY_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. Existing
  `R2_RESEARCH_*` secrets are out of scope and must not be repointed.
- The B4F code lane merged as `59478c96de6a52d44937dc15f79d0f6d7b00788f`
  after a real AAPL local run; production health later reported descendant
  `8bd108d3084`. The protected `attested-history-seed` environment has one
  required reviewer and a custom `main`-only deployment policy. Its two
  environment-scoped writer secrets
  (`R2_ATTESTED_HISTORY_SEED_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
  `R2_ATTESTED_HISTORY_SEED_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`), the four dedicated repository
  bindings, a live R2 seed, a reviewed non-confidential Actions bundle, and a
  committed canonical issuer packet are still pending.
- There is no cron, public product surface, Neural Web/Prophet authority,
  score, alert, or full-Calcbench-parity claim in this lane.

Resume B4F from its dedicated docket; do not infer that an earlier Wave 3A
test count, a local SEC sample, or the presence of a read-only secret proves
publication or issuer coverage.

## Current stop point

The Wave 3A receipt-acceptance baseline is complete. This memo is not deployment
evidence; confirm release/live state from Git and production health. Do not
represent Wave 3A as full Calcbench parity.

- Worktree: `/Users/chriswong/Documents/Cluade/Macro Dashboard/.claude/worktrees/calcbench-wave3a-acceptance-20260801`
- Branch: `codex/calcbench-wave3a-acceptance-20260801`
- Canonical build docket:
  `research/CALCBENCH_PARITY_WAVE_3A_BITEMPORAL_QUERY_BUILD_DOCKET_2026-08-02.md`
- This handoff is canonical for the Wave 3A acceptance/resume boundary.

## What Wave 3A now establishes

The source and ledger lanes retain bounded, append-only raw facts with distinct
source and system clocks. The query kernel adds one cutoff-visible
`GovernanceBundle` and a flat, deduplicated, bounded `CellNode` DAG. No receipt
uses recursive cell serialization. Formula cells recompute from dependency nodes;
direct value cells bind the selected immutable raw occurrence; non-value cells
are constrained to finite source-less, alias-lineage, or source-witness shapes.

The matrix JSON sidecar is the authoritative receipt object. CSV is a stable
projection, not a second receipt format. Matrix validation reconstructs the
governance/formula/direct-fact contract from the bundle and flat DAG, checks
hashes and all resource limits, and rejects clock, policy, entity, source,
withdrawal, revision, and period-rejection inconsistencies.

## Proof boundary

An accepted direct receipt proves selected-occurrence consistency: the emitted
value, entity, unit, concept, period, source lineage, mapping, and cutoff-visible
clocks agree. It does **not** prove the selected fact was globally optimal or
that all competing facts were absent; only an external immutable ledger can do
that. Wave 3B's durable `ffqs_*` snapshot is the intended standalone evidence
layer. Keep that boundary explicit in API and UI work.

## Acceptance status

- Final focused registry + query suite: **93 passed**.
- Final nine-file integration suite: **303 passed**.
- Two independent semantic/DAG reviews found no open P0/P1 correctness issue
  within the declared receipt proof scope.
- `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed with the final acceptance set.

## Resume and final verification sequence

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, this handoff, and the Wave 3A docket. Inspect `git status`;
   preserve existing working changes in the acceptance worktree.
2. Preserve the clean independent-audit baseline. Retain strict bounded input
   admission and add a regression test for every future correctness fix.
3. Run syntax, diff, and focused acceptance checks:

   ```bash
   cd "/Users/chriswong/Documents/Cluade/Macro Dashboard/.claude/worktrees/calcbench-wave3a-acceptance-20260801"
   python3 -m py_compile engine/fundamental_forensics/metric_registry.py engine/fundamental_forensics/query.py
   git diff --check
   PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider \
     tests/test_fundamental_forensics_metric_registry.py \
     tests/test_fundamental_forensics_query.py
   ```

4. Run the full integration suite:

   ```bash
   PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider \
     tests/test_fundamental_forensics_companyfacts.py \
     tests/test_fundamental_forensics_companyfacts_ledger.py \
     tests/test_fundamental_forensics_metric_registry.py \
     tests/test_fundamental_forensics_raw_ledger.py \
     tests/test_fundamental_forensics_periods.py \
     tests/test_fundamental_forensics_query.py \
     tests/test_fundamental_forensics_normalize.py \
     tests/test_fundamental_forensics_acquisition.py \
     tests/test_sec_document_spine.py
   ```

5. Only after those gates are green: fetch `origin/main`, rebase this clean task
   branch, rerun validation, commit only the session paths, open and squash-merge
   the PR, then verify the merge and production health under the repository ship
   contract. Record final counts, merge SHA, and live evidence here only after
   observing them.

## Wave 3B next lane (do not mix into Wave 3A)

The B4F pilot builds on the Wave 3B foundation: bounded streamed filing indexes;
safe no-network/no-DTD iXBRL/XML parsing; strict Company Facts attestation by
CIK + accession + taxonomy + concept + canonical value + period + unit; and
separate private `ffqs_*` snapshots with complete governance bundles, readback
verification, and latest-pointer-last publication. The first controlled issuer
run remains manual and receipt-first. Keep API/UI/Excel expansion and all
scheduling out of this activation.

No credentials or private tokens are required to resume this local checkpoint.
