# Macro Context Index — Benchmark

## Version

v1.6 — C0 Benchmark Truth Recovery source-audit pass 2026-08-28 (Sol operation
`macro-context-index-completion-20260828-sol-001`); 104 questions (CTX-001..CTX-104),
6 rows amended with receipts below, no rows added or removed.

### Amendment log

- **v1.6 (2026-08-28, adjudicated, C0 Benchmark Truth Recovery — full 104-row
  source audit + metric repair):** all 104 rows audited against current sources
  (macro `24ccea3fe482`; terminal `b1b21a17f843` and mastermind `e2092cb62355` via
  clean detached worktrees at fresh origin heads — the occupied local checkouts
  were stale/dirty and were not used as truth). Six rows amended:
  **CTX-067** and **CTX-069** (stale negatives — CXI-W1 shipped what they declared
  nonexistent: `scripts/context_index_query.py` and `config/context_index.yml`;
  regolded to positive `current_state`/`location` rows requiring those sources);
  **CTX-095** (stale negative — Terminal gained a committed positions ledger
  2026-08-13 (#408): `portfolio_positions` migration + `terminal/lib/portfolio.ts`
  CRUD + `/portfolio` route; regolded to `current_state` requiring `portfolio.ts`;
  execution-level fills do not exist — the required two-part answer is "positions
  ledger yes; execution fills no");
  **CTX-012** (`forbidden`→`superseded`: the CXI-R12 KILL-PARALLEL-KNOWLEDGE-BASE
  kill was OVERRULED/LIFTED by Chairman ruling 2026-08-12, row retained in §1 as
  history with "do not cite it to reject a proposal"; presence-only per CXI-R17c);
  **CTX-091** (required source was a terminal doc that was NEVER merged to master —
  exists only on archival branch `claude/root-recovery-20260809`; regolded to the
  surviving in-corpus authority `ingest/pull_macro_intel.py`, which carries the
  manifest-ETag root cause and fix); **CTX-087** (notes-only: `model_slice()` line
  citation 306→622 against current terminal head). Adjudicated NO-CHANGE:
  CTX-010/CTX-082 (the `superseded`-label-vs-§1-section layering is exactly what
  CXI-R17c ratified — presence-only grading; `superseded` is a benchmark enum
  value, not a DO_NOT_REBUILD section name). The 15 memory-overlay rows
  (`visibility: private`, project macro-dashboard, `memory://` sources) are
  untouched: the CXI-4 memory overlay is NOT_BUILT, so they fail/degrade honestly
  in private runs — failures are never counted as pass. Family-count correction:
  the v1.5 Families table was stale (CTX-094's v1.2 negative→contract regold was
  never reflected); true pre-amendment counts were negative_control 12/contract 8.
  Post-v1.6 histogram: 70 active / 14 forbidden / 8 killed / 3 superseded /
  9 no_answer. Negative-control family is now 9 rows (12→9 via the three stale-
  negative corrections); authoring replacement negatives is deferred to Sol.
  **Metric repair (same pass, evaluator only — no retrieval change):** the gate
  formerly labelled "Governance A0/A1 precision" was governance-family row
  pass-rate; it is now reported as an ungated informational line "Governance
  recall (row pass-rate)", and the ≥95% gate binds to TRUE micro-averaged
  precision of A0/A1 results (TP = top-10 A0/A1 result matching the row's
  required/acceptable sources; NOT-MET when zero A0/A1 results). A new explicit
  gate "Negative-control (no-answer) accuracy ≥90%" is added. Rows whose owning
  project DB is missing are NOT-EVALUATED (never pass, no_answer rows included)
  and force the global promotion gate plus any covering adjudication, governance,
  or negative-control gate to NOT-MET; rows outside the requested run scope do
  not trigger that rule;
  each row is evaluated against exactly its owning project's DB (CXI-R16); run
  headers now record repo SHA + dirty flag alongside index SHA per project.

- **v1.5 (2026-07-20, CXI-R18 — site-semantics glossary + comprehension family):** 8 new
  comprehension rows (CTX-097..CTX-104) appended covering the four highest-traffic pages
  (macro.html, us_stocks.html, china.html, china_stocks.html). Row CTX-097 = verbatim CSI300
  track record strip question. New `docs/site_semantics/` source added to
  `config/context_index.yml` (id=site-semantics, A3, markdown_sections chunker). New
  `comprehension` family added (count=8). No existing rows altered. Global row count: 96→104.
  **CXI-R21 regold (same pass, adjudicated):** as authored, each comprehension row required
  the glossary page AND the computing engine file jointly in top-10 — over-strict by the
  CXI-R17 defect class: the glossary entry alone answers a "what does this mean" question
  (its Computed-by line cites the engine source; `context_open` follows the citation).
  Regolded: glossary page = required, engine files = acceptable. Run v5 after regold:
  comprehension 8/8 = 100%; global 56.6% / replay 57.1% / governance 70.0% — gates still
  FAIL, printed. Negative controls 0/10 stay the open problem: the no-answer score floor
  is INERT at this corpus state (negative-control fused scores overlap active-query scores;
  a distinctive-term rule caused false nulls on real code queries and was removed) — next
  candidates are an IDF-rarity term rule or the CXI-R9-gated semantic lane, with this
  documented miss class as its entry evidence.

- **v1.4 (2026-07-18, adjudicated, CXI-R17 — grading semantics fix pass; one row
  regold):** the v1.2 grading-rule wording ("the labeled `required_status` is returned …
  **for each required source**") was unsatisfiable by construction for the 23 kill-class
  rows that pair an ACTIVE source (masterplan or engine file) with the registry verdict
  row (e.g. CTX-008, CTX-013, CTX-051, CTX-052): an active masterplan can never carry
  `killed`/`forbidden`. The CXI-2 grader as merged (#2981) already scoped the status
  check to verdict sources, but the rule text was never amended — this pass ratifies it
  (CXI-R17a): `required_status` binds ONLY to verdict-carrying registry sources among
  `required_sources`; all other required sources grade on top-10 presence alone.
  Two companions: (CXI-R17b) DO_NOT_REBUILD ingest now labels registry-row chunks by
  SECTION (§1→forbidden, §2→killed, §3→unknown, §4→deferred), implementing the
  already-ratified CXI-R4/finding-11 gate — verdict-cell keyword matching had mislabeled
  §2 rows quoting §1 vocabulary (WA-R1 "STRUCK — positioning-fusion illegal" derived
  `forbidden`, failing CTX-013 with the correct chunk at top rank); (CXI-R17c)
  `required_status: superseded` rows (CTX-010, CTX-082) grade presence-only — the
  one-status-per-chunk model cannot honestly label the amended PRD row, which stays
  live-`forbidden` for its surviving ban while recording the struck PRD-R1 sub-clause
  in text; supersession evidence = amended registry row + superseding masterplan, both
  still required in top-10. One regold rides with the pass: CTX-054 `killed`→`forbidden`
  — its TI-R5 target row is FILED in DO_NOT_REBUILD §1 (design-level prohibition; the
  verdict cell's KILLED wording is vocabulary drift), and under the section-is-authority
  gate §1 labels `forbidden`; the sweep found no other section-vs-gold mismatch across
  all 25 kill-class rows. Genuine retrieval misses (e.g. CTX-041/042/059/066: right
  chunk absent or below top-10) keep failing — gates stay honest.
  Status histogram after the regold: 59 active / 15 forbidden / 8 killed / 2 superseded /
  12 no_answer. BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md is now append-only (each eval appends a new run
  section; prior runs remain unchanged, matching the Append-only policy below).
  Run v2 recorded with this pass: global 51.5% (still FAIL), adjudication-replay
  50.0%→57.1%, governance 60.0%→70.0%; CTX-013/CTX-082 fixed by semantics, CTX-025/
  CTX-044 newly fail on adjudication-doc rank drift under the moving corpus (CTX-025
  already failed at origin/main before this pass) — retrieval quality, not grading;
  negative-control 0/10 remains the dominant miss class (CXI-2.x no-answer floor).

- **v1.3 (2026-07-18, adjudicated with CXI-2):** 13 `adjudication_replay` rows re-golded
  from `mode: research`/`operations` to `mode: adjudication`. The rows' mode fields were
  authored before CXI-2 defined mode semantics; `research` mode excludes killed/forbidden
  results, which made the flagship family unpassable by construction (a vetting session
  asking "was this killed?" uses adjudication mode, which includes kills). Queries, golden
  sources, and statuses unchanged. First eval (BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md): global 51.5%, replay
  50.0%, governance precision 60.0% — gates FAIL, printed honestly; dominant miss class is
  negative controls 0/10 (no no-answer score floor yet — first CXI-2.x iteration target).

- **v1.2 (2026-07-18, CXI-R16):** 15 cross-repo questions appended (CTX-082..CTX-096)
  covering Terminal (charting-app) and Mastermind placement/adjudication-replay, contracts,
  location, gotcha, doctrine, and negative-control families per CXI-R16. External-repo
  rows carry `visibility: private`; their `project` field is set to the owning project
  key (`terminal` or `mastermind`) so the eval harness opens the correct per-project DB.
  External-repo source paths in `required_sources` and notes use the stored scheme
  `repo://<project-key>/<relpath>` (e.g. `repo://terminal/signal_layer/contracts.py`).
  Status histogram: 59 active / 14 forbidden / 9 killed / 2 superseded / 12 no_answer.
  Paths verified against disk on 2026-07-18 (Sonnet builder + Opus audit + Fable fix pass).
  Eval of CTX-082..096 requires Terminal and Mastermind projects opted-in; results reported
  as a separate family block per CXI-R16.
  Audit notes: a third new negative control was authored but regolded to `contract`
  (CTX-094) after audit found committed Golden-Oracle Sharpe fixtures — a false null
  corrected beats a quota met (new-block negatives = 2, total no_answer = 12). CTX-085
  regolded to `macro-dashboard`/shared: the OAuth-rotation replay's honest answer is that
  macro's own `engine/neuralweb/key_pool.py` is the origin implementation (Mastermind's
  `key_rotor.py` is its credited port, kept as acceptable cross-repo corroboration).

- **v1.1 (2026-07-18, adjudicated):** CTX-010 regolded and CTX-068 notes amended after the
  UWP operator override (#2967, PRD Amendment 1) struck the PRD-R1 placement ban the same
  day as the v1 freeze. CTX-010 is now a supersession test (`required_status: superseded`):
  correct retrieval must surface the amended registry row + UWP masterplan, not the
  pre-override prohibition. Status histogram: 47 active / 14 forbidden / 9 killed /
  1 superseded / 10 no_answer. This event is itself evidence for the program: a governance
  golden went stale in under 24 hours, which is exactly the freshness/authority problem the
  Context Index exists to surface (docket §5, Failure 4).

## required_status vocabulary

Values are drawn from the `context_document.v1` status enum ratified in CXI-R4:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `active` | Source is current and authoritative |
| `historical` | Source is dated but not superseded |
| `superseded` | Source has been replaced by a newer document |
| `killed` | Topic killed/struck/falsified/refuted by ruling (typically DO_NOT_REBUILD §2) |
| `forbidden` | Topic forbidden/illegal/do-not-build by ruling (DO_NOT_REBUILD §1 FORBIDDEN/ILLEGAL/DON'T-TEST/DO-NOT-BUILD verdicts) |
| `deferred` | Topic held or suspended (DO_NOT_REBUILD §4) |
| `unknown` | Status could not be determined from canonical sources |
| `no_answer` | Negative control — no document satisfying the query exists in the repo |

The `no_answer` sentinel is not part of the `context_document.v1` enum; it is the grading
marker for negative-control rows where an honest "not found" packet is the correct answer.

## Grading rule

*(amended v1.4 per CXI-R17 — see Amendment log; v1.2 text bound `required_status` to
"each required source", which active companion sources cannot satisfy)*

A retrieval result satisfies a benchmark row when:

- Every file listed in `required_sources` appears in the top-10 retrieved results.
- The labeled `required_status` is returned in the result packet by the verdict-carrying
  registry source(s) among the required sources (`research/DO_NOT_REBUILD.md`,
  `config/ruling_graph.yml`, `config/compiled_kill_registry.yml`). All other required
  sources are graded on top-10 presence alone (CXI-R17a).
- Exception — `required_status: superseded` rows are presence-only (CXI-R17c): the
  amended registry row keeps the live status of its surviving ban; the supersession
  evidence is the amended row text plus the superseding masterplan, both required in
  top-10.
- For `no_answer` rows: the packet is an honest null/empty answer with no fabricated source.

Rows with `acceptable_sources` may use those sources to supplement or corroborate but are
not required in top-10.

Promotion gates (from research/MACRO_CONTEXT_INDEX_ADJUDICATION_BY_FABLE.md CXI-R5/CXI-R6/CXI-R16):

- Global: >=90% Recall@10 across all 104 rows (shared-visibility rows only for the baseline run).
- Adjudication-replay family: >=90% Recall@10 on rows with `family: adjudication_replay`.
- Governance A0/A1 precision (true, v1.6 metric repair): >=95% micro-averaged
  precision of A0/A1 results returned for governance-family rows (TP = top-10
  A0/A1 result matching the row's required/acceptable sources; A0 = CLAUDE.md;
  A1 = configs/ruling-graph/kill-registry). NOT-MET when zero A0/A1 results are
  returned. The pre-v1.6 "precision" number was governance row pass-rate; it is
  still reported as the ungated informational line "Governance recall (row
  pass-rate)".
- Negative-control (no-answer) accuracy (explicit gate since v1.6): >=90%
  pass-rate over `family: negative_control` rows in scope.
- Cross-repo block (CTX-082..CTX-096): evaluated separately with Terminal and Mastermind projects opted-in; reported as a distinct family block in the eval report (CXI-R16). Rows whose owning project DB is missing are NOT-EVALUATED and never counted as pass; any intended in-scope NOT-EVALUATED row forces the global promotion gate and its covering adjudication, governance, or negative-control gate to NOT-MET. Rows omitted because the caller did not request private scope are not intended in-scope rows.

## Append-only policy

This file is append-only after a freeze tag. Rows are never edited post-freeze except by
adjudicated fix passes (see Amendment log).

Future questions append after CTX-081 and receive the next sequential id. A new eval run
records a new version tag; prior runs remain unchanged.

## Families

*(counts as of v1.6, 2026-08-28; the v1.5 table had never absorbed CTX-094's v1.2
negative→contract regold)*

| Family | Count | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `location` | 12 | Where does X live? |
| `code` | 8 | What does function/file X do? |
| `governance` | 11 | Is X allowed? What ruling applies? |
| `current_state` | 6 | What is the current status of X? |
| `gotcha` | 10 | What trap/failure mode exists for X? |
| `architecture` | 8 | How does system X fit together? |
| `contract` | 8 | What schema/contract governs X? |
| `research` | 6 | What is the finding/verdict on X? |
| `freshness` | 1 | How stale is artifact X allowed to be? |
| `operations` | 1 | Operational question |
| `adjudication_replay` | 16 | Does the repo already cover this proposed work? |
| `negative_control` | 9 | Negative controls (no_answer expected) |
| `comprehension` | 8 | User-facing stat/panel explanation — what does X mean and how is it computed? |

v1.2 cross-repo note: rows CTX-082..CTX-096 reference Terminal (charting-app) and
Mastermind paths using the stored source_uri scheme `repo://<project-key>/<relpath>`
(e.g. `repo://terminal/signal_layer/contracts.py`, `repo://mastermind/MAINTENANCE.md`).
Each row's `project` field names the owning project so the eval harness opens the correct
per-project DB. These rows carry `visibility: private` and are only graded when those
projects are opted-in per CXI-R16.

See research/MACRO_CONTEXT_INDEX_ADJUDICATION_BY_FABLE.md CXI-R5/CXI-R16 for the minimum
family floors and cross-repo eval instructions.
