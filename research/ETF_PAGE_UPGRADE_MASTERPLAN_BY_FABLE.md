# ETF Page Upgrade Masterplan — by Fable

**Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** ACTIVE (this session) · **Owner:** etfs.html surface (blanket `macro` program; no dedicated sub-program — this file is now its program record)
**Operator mandate:** the Fund Flows page (mastermind-x.com/etfs.html) has been an outstanding early-surface for names that later ran (operator cites SPCX, CRWV, NVDA, TSM, uranium complex, CRCL). Invest heavily: more funds for granularity, investigate fund weighting, advanced calculations/engine upgrades for accuracy+robustness, then a full UI/UX pass aligned with macro.html design taste.

## §0 ACCEPTANCE GATES (not done unless)

1. **Existing suites green**: `tests/test_etfs_gate.py`, `test_etf_board.py`, `test_etf_new_sponsors.py`, `test_etf_pulse.py` all pass, plus new unit tests for every new engine function (synthetic fixtures, incl. adversarial ones listed in §3).
2. **Tier contract intact**: free shell carries zero graded rows; shell ≤130KiB budget holds; `site/premiumdata/etfs.json` gate untouched (`config/site_access.yml`); partials remain the single source for gated/ungated builds.
3. **Display-tier epistemics intact**: `may_rank/gate/size: false` blocks stay; stance vocabulary unchanged (Act · Get ready · Watch — don't chase · Protect gains · Stand aside · Ignore); NO composite regime/allocation verdict (DNR:KILL-REGIME-SCORECARD); no "validated"/accuracy claims in user-facing copy (CI-guarded); falsifier language never front-facing; plain-word null disclosure for every new stat (banned-vocab tests extended to new copy).
4. **Universe expansion proven, not asserted**: every added fund ships with a real fetched snapshot receipt (collector run in this worktree) or is dropped; no silent parse failures — coverage table renders every fund with cadence + history depth.
5. **Decomposition correctness pinned by tests**: pure creation/redemption fixture → selection ≈ 0; pure rebalance fixture → flow ≈ 0; share-split fixture → guarded (no fake accumulation); duplicate-snapshot fixture → deduped; weight-sum sanity guard fires on corrupt snapshot.
6. **Weighting is a lens, not a promotion**: equal-weight fund counts remain the primary read; any weighting shown is secondary, structural (not fitted), disclosed in plain words, and red-teamed by an opus reviewer before ship (adjudication coverage gate). No predictive-weight claims without gauntlet — this session explicitly does NOT promote.
7. **Render budget respected**: zero new network calls in `build_etf_page` render path; new computation stays O(snapshots already loaded); heavy work (backfill, fetches) lives in collectors/nightly only. Ledger writes happen on the nightly path only (nightly is the sole advancer of forward ledgers).
8. **Local proof**: `build_etf_page` runs on real `data/` in this worktree via a scratch harness; rendered HTML screenshots (light + dark + zh) attached to the PR body.
9. **i18n parity**: every new EN string has a zh dual-span (`.l-en`/`.l-zh` page-local pattern); no translated text in `title=` attributes.
10. **Ship loop complete**: commit → push → PR (screenshots in body) → `merge-on-green` → post-merge render covers → live verification of https://www.mastermind-x.com/etfs.html.

## §1 Current architecture (census 2026-08-12)

- **Template:** `templates/etfs.html.j2` (728 ln) + partials `_etf_board_rows`, `_etf_fresh_cards`, `_etf_accumulation_rows`, `_etf_trim_rows`, `_etf_macros` (tier-wall parity via shared partials). All CSS inline; zh via page-local dual spans.
- **Builder:** `scripts/build_site.py::build_etf_page` (L3056-3161) → writes `site/etfs.html`, `site/premiumdata/etfs.json`, `site/stockdata/fund_flows.json`.
- **Engines:** `engine/holdings_signals.py::etf_signals/all_etf_signals` (share-based conviction_pp per fund-ticker, D71), `engine/etf_board.py` (stance, hero verdict, fresh conviction), `engine/etf_consensus.py` (consensus_favored: n_accum/n_trim/n_new/n_exit + net/gross conviction_pp, min 2 funds, top 40; weight_trajectory sparklines; fund_coverage).
- **Data:** `data/etf_holdings/<TICKER>/<date>.parquet` (75 funds) + `data/holdings/` (ARKK/ARKW) = 77 funds; schema `ticker,name,weight_pct,shares,market_value,as_of`; collectors `collectors/etf_holdings.py` (SSGA/GlobalX/Roundhill/VanEck/FirstTrust/Sprott/Amplify/Defiance/Bitwise/Invesco/Procure/ETC + stockanalysis.com fallback), nightly via `scripts/collect.py`.
- **Known gaps:** consensus is an equal-weight count+sum; conviction is %-of-fund-weight only (no $ magnitude — a 0.5pp add by a $4B fund reads the same as by a $30M fund); passive-fund weight changes conflate price drift/index rebalance with true investor flow; no split/dup/cadence guards; no measurement loop; no site_semantics glossary entry.

## §2 Design principle — two signals, not one

Fund holdings changes carry **two distinct signals** that the current engine conflates:
- **FLOW** (works for passive thematic funds — URA, SMH, NUKZ…): creation/redemption scales all constituents' shares roughly pro-rata → Δ(common scale factor) = investor demand into the theme, which mechanically buys constituents. This is the "fund flows" the operator prizes.
- **SELECTION** (works for active funds — ARKK, OZEM…): per-constituent share changes beyond the common scale factor = manager conviction.

**W1 centerpiece:** decompose each fund's snapshot-pair diff into `flow_component + selection_component` per constituent (robust common-scale estimator, e.g. median share ratio across continuing constituents; residual = selection). Aggregate per ticker across funds: flow-$ and selection-$ separately, with implied price = market_value/shares. Everything stays inside the holdings lens (no cross-organ composite).

## §3 Backend waves

### W1 — Decomposition + dollars + robustness (engine core)
- `engine/holdings_signals.py`: add flow/selection decomposition on the existing snapshot-pair diff path; keep `conviction_pp` untouched for compatibility.
- **$ estimates:** per fund-ticker event: `Δshares × implied_price` split into flow-$/selection-$; per-ticker cross-fund aggregates: `total_$`, `flow_$`, `selection_$`, `n_funds_flow`, `n_funds_selection`.
- **Robustness guards (each with a test fixture):** share-split guard (shares jump k× while market_value ≈ flat → normalize, never fake accumulation); duplicate same-day snapshot dedup; cadence normalization (per-day rates when funds report at different intervals; stale-fund flag past N days); weight-sum sanity (sum(weight_pct) far from 100 → quarantine snapshot + printed null); missing-constituent continuity (ticker rename/absence ≠ full exit unless persistent).
- **Persistence/breadth:** per fund-ticker streak (consecutive snapshots same direction), acceleration (Δ conviction vs prior window); per-ticker breadth = distinct funds adding within lookback.
- `engine/etf_consensus.py`: extend consensus rows with the new fields; `contested` logic aware of flow-vs-selection disagreement.
- Payload/template: add fields to `premiumdata/etfs.json` + minimal row wiring (real presentation deferred to UI wave); `stockdata/fund_flows.json` enriched (n_funds, net $, breadth).

### W2 — Universe expansion + fund registry + weighting lens
- **Registry:** new `config` block per fund: `{type: active|thematic_passive|sector, sponsor, theme_tags}` — drives which component (flow vs selection) is the fund's primary signal, and the coverage table.
- **Expansion:** consult `research/ETF_DATA_SOURCES.md` (D72) + `collectors/etf_holdings.py` sponsor support; add ~25-40 funds prioritizing operator themes (space, AI/datacenter/compute, nuclear/uranium, robotics, defense, crypto infrastructure, semis, biotech, rare-earths/critical minerals, drones, grid/power) where the sponsor is parseable or the stockanalysis fallback covers it. Each add proven per §0.4; backfill history where the feed allows (Roundhill/GlobalX claim 2024+), committed under `data/etf_holdings/`.
- **Weighting investigation (§4 outcome lands here):** structural weighting lens only.

### W3 — Measurement ledger + semantics (accuracy earns receipts)
- Nightly-path writer: each night append consensus-board top-N (ticker, rank, net conviction, flow/selection split, as-of price) to `data/etf_board_ledger/` (append-only, one file per date). Grader fills forward returns (5/21/63d) as they mature; summary artifact for the Calibration Lab (below-the-fold; windows language, never "accuracy/validated" front-facing).
- `docs/site_semantics/etfs.md`: glossary for every published stat (closes the semantics gap).
- This ledger is what earns any FUTURE predictive fund-weighting promotion; not consumed by rankings now.

## §4 Weighting investigation (decision)

Question (operator): should some funds count more in consensus?
- **Predictive weighting (fit weights to forward returns): REJECTED for now** — history depth is weeks-to-months for most funds (honest-N far too small per fund; episode-level N smaller still), and any fitted weighting is a promotion-to-authority move requiring prereg + gauntlet. The W3 ledger accrues exactly the evidence a future gauntlet needs.
- **Structural weighting (no fitting): ADOPTED as a secondary lens** — three transparent, mechanical factors: (a) signal-type match: selection events from `active` funds and flow events from `thematic_passive` funds count fully; the mismatched component of each fund is discounted (it is mechanically noisier — passive "selection" is mostly index rebalance; active "flow" is mostly firm-level marketing); (b) $ magnitude: aggregate real dollars, not just fund counts — a $4B fund's 0.5pp is not a $30M fund's 0.5pp; (c) freshness/cadence: stale funds (no snapshot ≥ N days) flagged and excluded from "this cycle" reads.
- **Primary read stays equal-weight fund counts** (breadth is the most manipulation-resistant stat); the weighted lens is presented beside it, plainly labeled. Red-team gate (§0.6) before ship.

**IMPLEMENTED 2026-08-12 (W2b, `engine/etf_consensus.py`).** Consensus rows now carry `weighted_usd` (type-matched dollars + `mismatch_discount` × mismatched dollars), `weighted_n` (driver-weighted fund count) and `weight_receipt` — 13 printable inputs (`usd_matched`, `usd_mismatched`, `usd_mismatched_weighted`, `n_active_selection`, `n_passive_flow`, `n_mismatched`, `n_unattributed`, `n_stale_excluded`, `n_funds_usd`, `weighted_usd_complete`, both knobs, `n_funds_weighted`) so `weighted_usd = usd_matched + discount × usd_mismatched` re-derives by hand; each fund on the row also carries `fund_type` + its own `weight`.
Defaults `etf_holdings.weighting.mismatch_discount: 0.35` and `unattributed_weight: 0.35` (an event with no decomposition is discounted and disclosed, never dropped); freshness reuses `flow_stale_days`, so stale funds leave the weighted read while staying in every equal-weight count. Premium payload only (`flows` block) — the free shell renders none of it.
**Default board ordering is untouched and pinned** by `tests/fixtures/etf_consensus_golden_ordering.json` (207 tickers frozen from real `data/`, replayed in `tests/test_etf_weighting.py`) plus a type-flip mutation control. **Not promoted**: display-tier lens, no gate/rank/size authority — sorting by it is a UI offer, and on live data it lifts single-fund and net-NEGATIVE names (TXN d#94→w#8) that breadth-first deliberately suppresses, so the UI wave must keep the equal-weight board primary.

## §5 UI/UX wave (after backend merges locally, same PR)

- Designer (opus) pass, doctrine + frontend-design skill loaded, aligned with macro.html's design language; I (Fable) pin the spec before build.
- Keep: partial architecture (tier-wall parity), stance system, zh dual-span, ≤130KiB shell, premium gate, disclosure footer.
- Elevate: glance-tier hero (state + plain-word stance); consensus board readability (the $ and breadth columns become first-class); flow-vs-selection presented as plain words ("investors are pouring in" vs "managers are picking it"); persistence chips; coverage table → fund registry view; hover receipts for every stat (Tier-2, own banned-list).
- **Doctrine pins (from docs/DESIGN_DOCTRINE.md, binding):**
  - Tier budgets hard: title ≤4 words, subtitle ≤14, row ≤1 line; one as-of stamp per panel; ONE merged footnote; demote, don't compress.
  - Any illustrative time-series (incl. upgraded sparklines) uses the ilx idiom — `lib/illus.py` SSR SVG + `illus.css`/`illus.js` — never Plotly, never hand-rolled canvas.
  - Tape-like strips use the sanctioned `.dtp` self-labeling chip idiom; no rank-number pills, no stacked disclaimers.
  - Tier-2 receipts via LENS `data-tip-en/zh` (+ `data-tip-rc-en/zh` receipt lines); `?` help tip on panel h2 is the sanctioned mechanics home.
  - Light mode is a design target, not a token swap: white panels on deeper canvas (#e8ebf1-class), no glow backdrops in light, ghosted blur-teasers (saturate .35, opacity ≤.5), 1px gaps + track borders on segment bars; both-theme screenshots judged as designs.
  - Icons: monoline set `templates/_icons.html.j2` (stroke=currentColor) — emoji are not UI icons.
  - Directional color through `--up`/`--down` tokens only (zh 红涨绿跌 flips them); position/measurement markers never take a category hue.
  - 5-second test on every panel; question-as-subheading framing and number-with-meaning pairing are the canonized patterns.
- Proof: light/dark/zh screenshots in PR body (§0.8).

## §6 Constraints (standing)

- DNR:KILL-REGIME-SCORECARD (no composite regime/allocation verdict on this page), DNR:KILL-LLM-ORIGINATION (no LLM-originated scores), display-tier Authority blocks stay verbatim.
- Access contract `config/site_access.yml` (shell public exact; `/premiumdata/` enforced early) — do not touch.
- Render lane: `build_etf_page` is on `build_site.py` spine (render.yml region `macro`; template edits → scope=all). No new I/O on that path.
- Bilingual EN/ZH; no zh in `title=` attrs (CI-guarded).
- `data/` writes only on nightly path; intraday lanes discard them.

## §6b Mid-program adjudications (Fable, 2026-08-12, on W1's findings)

- **R1 — VanEck cash-line defect: FIX IN THIS PR** (dedicated commit after W2b integrates). `is_non_equity_holding` misses the `-USD CASH-` ticker form (NaN name); the cash line's share count corrupts the sum-ratio scale, publishing phantom active-change on every constituent of 15 funds (SMH worst: 21 names at phantom +5.12%, incl. NVDA +1.078pp conviction on the live board). This is a truthfulness bug fix, display-tier, no gauntlet; conviction_pp values will move and the PR body says so plainly. Golden ordering fixtures regenerate in the same commit.
- **R2 — one primary number per row**: the board ranks and headlines conviction_pp (trustworthy post-R1); flow/selection is the plain-word explanation + `driver` label, Tier-2 receipts carry the split. Never two competing bold numbers on a row (designer-binding).
- **R3 — shell budget at 103 funds**: fresh render = 160.6 KiB vs 130 KiB gate (coverage directory grew with the universe). The UI wave MUST land the shell back ≤130 KiB (lean coverage treatment; full registry detail belongs behind the gate or a detail view). Without this the first post-merge bake reds `test_free_shell_stays_inside_its_weight_budget`.
- **R4 — split-guard adjacent-snapshot upgrade**: future work (needs off-render-path reads); a combined split+add (~2:1 plus real 7% add) is currently missed by design — miss = status quo, false positive = deleted live signal.
- **R5 — no git-level file reverts in this shared worktree** for the remainder of the program (a builder's brief `checkout HEAD --` A/B window can eat a sibling's concurrent write).

## §6c Red-team rulings (Fable, 2026-08-12 — reviewer verdict: no-ship until fixed)

W4 fix wave, binding:
- **B1 (blocker)**: a split the guard positively identified (ARKW/CRWD 3:1, shares ×2.977, MV ×0.9856) still publishes +207.93% active change / +1.6274 conviction_pp and counts in n_accum. FIX: apply the decomposition's split verdict to the ranked path — any fund-ticker event with `split_adjusted=True` is dropped from conviction_pp/n_accum/board/ledger inputs (it remains in Tier-2 receipts, labeled). Golden fixture regenerates again. Glossary sentence "an affected position is normalised" becomes true.
- **M2 (major)**: retype CHAT/OZEM/CABZ/HUMN to `active` (Roundhill actively-managed; repo already calls OZEM active in §2 + glossary); audit ALL 105 registry rows against sponsor lines, record `registry_audited: 2026-08-12` in the config block; add a pin flagging any fund whose name contains "Active" typed non-active.
- **M5**: `total_usd/flow_usd/selection_usd` → None when `n_funds_usd == 0` (27 rows today), matching the W2b null contract; fixture for the all-None case; glossary "floor" sentence corrected for signed values.
- **M3**: add machine-readable `sign_diverges_from_total: bool` beside weighted_usd; glossary discloses that the discount applies to signed components so the weighted read can exceed or invert the raw one (NVDA/TSM live examples); UI pin — total_usd is the primary $ column, weighted only ever renders WITH its receipt and never as "the better number".
- **M4**: glossary section for the whole lens: weighted_usd/weighted_n/weight_receipt/mismatch_discount/unattributed_weight; 0.35 constants stated as judgment-set, not fitted; M3 hazard; M6 window heterogeneity; primary-read-stays-breadth.
- **M6**: publish `window_days_min/max` on consensus rows; glossary states the 40-snapshot window spans 25–64 calendar days by fund; per-day aggregation deferred (future work note).
- **M7**: §5 designer pin (already in the designer brief, now standing): any weighted ordering excludes net_conviction_pp<0 and renders n_accum/n_trim inline.
- **Minors folded in**: m10 (n_immature vs n_unpriceable), m11 (bench freeze gated on bench_ret), m16 (drop engine_head from fixture provenance), m18 (corrupt artifact renders the same collecting state as missing), m20 (usd_stale_excluded receipt key), m12 (weight_trajectory routed through the same hygiene filters), m9 (tile copy disclosing pooled overlapping windows; n_names stays visible).
- **Documented, not changed**: m8 (sum-vs-median estimator gap → glossary + future reconciliation decision), m13/m14/m15 (inert factors, sector flattening, discount-dominance — glossary honesty notes), m17/futures class (follow-up chip — **now CLOSED, see below**), m19 (fund_flows.json publicness kept; docstring corrected).
- **M21**: rebase onto fresh origin/main before PR (upstream workflow-yaml job moved).

### m17 — index-futures class: CLOSED 2026-08-12 (was "documented, not changed")

Chipped as a latent risk on the reading that the futures-carrying funds (QQQ,
RSP, MDY) sit outside the universe. **That reading was incomplete: the defect is
already shipping.** A sweep of all 55,612 rows in `data/etf_holdings` +
`data/holdings` finds futures overlays in five funds, and **BOTZ, BUG and XOP are
in the universe today** — BOTZ on both sides of the gate:

| fund | ticker | name | weight | in universe |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BOTZ | `NQM6 Index` → `NQU6 Index` | NASDAQ 100 E-MINI JUN26 → SEP26 | 0.43% → 0.44% | **yes** |
| BUG | `NQM6 Index` → `NQU6 Index` | same | 0.12% → 0.10% | yes (under `min_position_pct`) |
| XOP | `IXPM6` → `IXPU6` | XAE ENERGY JUN26 → SEP26 | negative-weight legs | yes |
| QQQ | `NQM6`, `NQM6_` | CME E-Mini NASDAQ 100 Index Future | ±0.111% (offsetting pair) | no |
| RSP | `LWEM6` | E-mini S&P 500 Equal Weight Futures | 0.226%, $208.7M | no |

The harm is not R1's: the contract count is too small to move the denominator.
It lands on the **lifecycle path**. The contract ROLLS quarterly, and a ticker
that vanishes while another appears is exactly the shape of a full exit plus a
brand-new position — the two strongest signals the board publishes. BOTZ's
2026-06-16 roll is live in the engine right now as a 0.43%-weight EXIT and a
0.44% NEW position, both above `min_position_pct`, off a rollover that moved no
money and changed no exposure. Between rolls the count still moves (BOTZ 28 → 25
contracts on 2026-06-26), which publishes as a −10.7% "manager trim".

FIX (shipped): `_FUTURES_NAME_RE` + `_FUTURES_TICKER_RE` in `collectors/holdings.py`,
inside the shared `is_non_equity_holding` predicate, so the collector and the diff
engine agree as they do for cash. Verified delta over the full corpus: **7 rows
newly dropped, all seven genuine futures, zero real issuers affected.**

**Conservatism ruling — the shape rule is refused.** A bare CME
root+month+year ticker (`^[A-Z]{2,4}[FGHJKMNQUVXZ]\d$`) would catch
NQM6/LWEM6/IXPM6 directly, and it is tempting because it needs no name. It is
**not to be added**: Latin-American local tickers share the shape exactly —
`CMIG4` (Cemig) and `BRKM5` (Braskem) are letters + a CME month code + a digit.
Wrongly dropping a real equity is strictly worse than keeping a futures line,
because a dropped name leaves no trace in any output, whereas a surviving
futures line is visible and gradeable. Every futures row in the live corpus is
already caught by name, so the shape rule buys nothing for that risk. The
name rule likewise never keys on a bare `future`/`option` substring, and never
on the singular `future` alone — `FutureFuel Corp` and `Option Care Health Inc`
are live holdings and `Future plc` is a listed issuer.

## §7 Rollout & verification

1. W1 → W2 → W3 built sequentially by opus `builder` agents in this worktree (branch `claude/etf-page-upgrade-20260812`), each wave with tests green before the next starts.
2. Opus `reviewer` red-team on weighting/claims/copy + code review of the full diff.
3. Designer wave (§5), then local harness render + screenshots.
4. One PR: engine+collectors+config+templates+tests+this file (+ backfilled parquets if modest). `merge-on-green` label; live verify after the covering render.
5. Post-merge: first nightly collects expanded universe; coverage table verifies day-2. Ledger begins accruing; revisit predictive weighting only when the ledger has real depth (explicitly out of scope now).
