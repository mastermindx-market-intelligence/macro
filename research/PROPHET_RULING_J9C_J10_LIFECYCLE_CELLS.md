# Prophet program ruling — §J.9(c) + §J.10: lifecycle semantics, the cell set, and surface ownership

**Ruling authority:** the Prophet program lane (owner of `scripts/build_prophet.py`,
`engine/prophet_bridge.py`, `engine/prophet_management.py`, and the live card).
**Date:** 2026-08-13 (UTC). **Answers:** PR #5500
(`research/PROPHET_DECISION_PACKET_J9C_J10_STAGE_SEMANTICS.md`) and Sol's §J.9 clause-3
deferral. **Unblocks:** PR-0(c) and the Prophet Board migration (factory docket item 6).
**Verified against:** the live committed payload on `origin/main` as of 2026-08-13 02:45Z
(`site/prophet/index.json` asof 2026-08-10, `site/factordata/us_standouts.json` as_of
2026-08-10, `site/prophet/showcase.json`, `data/us_board_ledger/snapshots.jsonl`
2026-06-30→2026-08-07) and at source on the same head.

## §0 The ruling, in six sentences

1. **(i) — ratified:** Bottoming/Turning/Ready/Trend is a **price/entry read** (`lane`),
   not a lifecycle; the two are separate dimensions by construction (packet §1 confirmed
   at source).
2. **(ii) — the lane dimension survives; its rail rendering retires.** `lane` stays
   untouched in the engine, the ledgers, and ranking; the 4-dot progress tracker built on
   it is retired at migration because it renders a progression the engine does not
   compute and **two of its four steps are structurally unreachable** (§1.1 — now
   verified, no longer a lead).
3. **(ii) — the lifecycle survives as a DERIVED projection, not a minted enum.** No new
   engine judgment is created: `lifecycle_state` is a total display-tier function over
   fields already computed and published (`phase`, `closed`, the union watch receipt).
   The six-state enum as literally specified (Early/Confirming/Confirmed/Aging/Extended/
   Invalidated) is **refused**: two of its cells have no producer (§2.4) and it fuses two
   different live axes (§3).
4. **The cell set (the §J.9(c) deliverable) is §6:** Watch 观察 · Ready 就绪 · Entered 入场 ·
   Delivering 达标 · Overtime 超时 · Invalidated 失效 · Resolved 已结 — exhaustive and
   disjoint at a declared unit of account (cells count **plan rows**; `watch` counts
   tickers with no open plan), every cell with a named producer (the watch cell's
   exporter pass-through is a PR-0(c) item — §6 fn.1), the live cells summing to the
   headline total by construction.
5. **(iii) — surfaces:** the count ladder and the card/detail lifecycle vocabulary belong
   to `lifecycle_state`; the price read demotes to a mark chip + LENS receipt; the
   candidate screener keeps its triage buckets under a different noun; `phase` stays the
   engine truth and never renders as slugs; the word **"stage" retires from all
   user-facing Prophet vocabulary** (§7, Sol's naming law).
6. **No lane recut → no ledger migration.** `lifecycle_state` is additive
   (optional-fields path); fossils are never rewritten; the only ledger touch is a
   stale-comment heal (§8).

## §1 Packet verification (PR #5500) — what I confirmed, what I amend

The packet was prepared by the design lane, explicitly unreviewed by this lane (its §8).
Every load-bearing claim was re-verified at source and against the live payload:

| Packet claim | Verdict | Receipt |
|---|---|---|
| `stage` int = lane lookup, conviction never feeds it | **CONFIRMED** | `build_prophet.py:237,312`; `score_edge` fills the Edge slot at `:364,382` |
| §4 lead: `stage=4` unreachable | **CONFIRMED — upgraded from lead to fact, and extended: `stage=2` is unreachable too** | §1.1 below: source + live payload + full ledger history |
| four stage-like taxonomies | **AMENDED: there are seven**, and four of them ship under the literal field name `stage` | §2 census |
| `stage_key` vocabulary is `live·setting_up·ran·blocked` | **AMENDED: five values** — `basing` was added by the D18 bottom-watch shelf (`engine/us_board_rank.py:725-780`) | `stage_for()` docstring; labels at `dashboard.html.j2:15907-15911` |
| lane recut = data migration | **CONFIRMED**, and this ruling avoids it entirely | §8 |
| `grade_us_board.py:756` comment stale | **CONFIRMED** — comment says `'trend' \| 'recovery' \| None`; live domain is `bottoming/continuation/watch(/leader/recovery)` | §8 heal rides PR-0(c) |

### §1.1 The stage=4 verdict (packet §4, closed)

Three independent proofs, strongest first:

- **Source:** v2 `_lane_for()` (`build_stock_library.py:1407-1441`) returns only
  `bottoming`/`continuation`. The trend rows are tagged with **no lane override**
  (`:4815-4818` — deliberately, per its own comment, "so the continuation branch
  fires"). **No code path assigns `lane="trend"`.** And `lane="recovery"` (`:4811`)
  iterates `_recovery_cands`, which is **hardcoded structurally empty** —
  `build_stock_library.py:4528-4535` says it outright: "The W8-C scan is structurally
  empty: recovery candidates live on the trend lane already. Retain the variable names
  so all downstream references … compile." No append exists in scope; the only
  reassignment is a filter that cannot add. **`stage=2` is as unreachable as `stage=4`.**
- **Live payload:** `us_standouts.json` (as_of 2026-08-10), 69 buy rows:
  `bottoming` 45 · `continuation` 23 · `watch` 1. Zero `trend`, zero `recovery`.
- **History:** the entire v1 board ledger (`snapshots.jsonl`, 18 snapshot dates,
  2026-06-30→2026-08-07, 828 buy-row observations): `bottoming` 351 · `continuation` 325 ·
  `watch` 55 · `None` 97 (the three pre-P2.4 dates). **Zero `trend` and zero `recovery`
  rows have ever been written.**

So on the shipped US board: dot 4 ("Trend / 趋势") and dot 2 ("Turning / 转向")
**cannot light** (US scope — `china.html.j2:3551` hardcodes `'stage': 4` onto a CN
shelf, §10.2), and `watch`/`leader` rows fall through to `stage=0`, rendering an
all-grey rail with **no label lit** (live example: UEC today; 2 of 12 cards on the
anonymous landing showcase; 55 historical ledger rows). US users have been shown a
four-step journey where half the steps are impossible and some cards are on no step
at all.

### §1.2 The deeper defect the packet circled but did not name

`lane` is not a progression. It is an **entry-door classification** — which construction
admitted the name (bottoming-reversal vs continuation-pullback vs recovery). A name does
not move bottoming → turning → ready → trend; it is admitted through one door and stays
(nightly recomputation can flip a label, but nothing tracks or promises advancement).
Rendering a categorical origin as a 4-step progress tracker asserts a journey the engine
never computes. That — not the unreachable dot — is why the rail retires rather than
gets relabeled: **any relabel would still be a progress bar over a category.**

## §2 The full census — seven stage-like vocabularies, four shipping under the name `stage`

| # | Field (machine) | Values | Semantic axis | Producer | Shipped where |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `stage` (int, card) | 0–4 via `_STAGE_BY_LANE` | price/entry lane, re-rendered as progress | `build_prophet.py:237,312` **and an inline duplicate of the map** at `dashboard.html.j2:16016` | 4-dot rail + labels on every `pv_card` (`_prophet_card.html.j2:418-419`); landing showcase |
| 2 | `stage` (str, board row) | `live·setting_up·ran·basing·blocked` | **triage/actionability** of tonight's candidates (entry status + cycle gate) | `us_board_rank.py:1092` (`stage_for`, `:724`) | board grouping + `data-stage` filter rail, shipped EN/ZH (`dashboard.html.j2:15907-15911`, `hk.html.j2:378-395`) |
| 3 | `phase` (plan) | `pre_trigger·triggered_pre_t1·at_t1·between_t1_t2·at_t2·overtime·invalidated` (internal superset adds `post_t1_failed_hold`, `post_t2`) | **plan-management lifecycle** post-origination | `engine/prophet_management.py:41-62`; humanised `:1074-1111`; published `build_prophet.py:1298,1932` | every plan in `site/prophet/index.json` (140/140 rows carry it); `pulse` strings |
| 4 | `early_turn.stage` | `EARLY` (only) | **admission-lane fact column** (operator-ratified 2026-08-11: which lane a row reads from) | `us_early_turn.py:959,1213`; ridden onto rows at `prophet_bridge.py:4386` | deck-admitted rows; Terminal deck |
| 5 | `stage` (str, stocktable) | `ENTRY·RIPENING·RAN_LATE·KNIFE` | a **fourth** lane re-map, with its own user-facing label **"Stage / 阶段"**, filter, and rendered count chips | `dashboard.html.j2:15785` (a second inline lane map) → `templates/stocktable.js:137,331,784,1145-1157` | the US stock table (`#us-stocktable-data`); its `RIPENING` chip keys on `recovery`, so it can never fire (§1.1) — a dead chip already shipping |
| 6 | `stage_detailed` (Weinstein) | classic 1–4 | Weinstein stage | `engine/weinstein_stage.py` | never rendered |
| 7 | `stage_tilt` (plan) | tilt claim | separate program | plans payload | `DNR:HOLD-PSQ-TILT-CLOCK` stands; out of scope here |

Also found in passing (documented, no action ordered here): (a) `retro_grades.parquet`
has a column named `lane` whose domain is `buy/watch/laggards/leaders` — **board-list
membership**, not the row's entry lane; (b) the current v2 ledger
(`snapshots_v2.jsonl`) keys a `lanes` block on `entry_open`/`setting_up` — a third
vocabulary under `lane`; (c) the key `early_turn_watch` is itself overloaded —
`engine/basket_score.py:372,426` publishes one of shape `list[dict]` (consumed by
`basket_detail.html.j2:1132`) while the bridge's intake receipt is `list[str]`; the
PR-0(c) exporter item (§9.1a) must pass through the bridge's, not the basket's.

### §2.4 The dead constants — why the literal six-state enum is refused

`STAGE_CONFIRMING` and `STAGE_CONFIRMED` (`us_early_turn.py:960-961`) are **defined and
never assigned anywhere** (repo-wide: the only assignment is `STAGE_EARLY` at `:1213`;
the only test import is `STAGE_EARLY`). This is deliberate on the confirmed lane — the
bridge documents absence-as-design (`prophet_bridge.py:4354-4357`: "a confirmed-lane row
has no stage… because none of those are statements about it"). A ladder cell named
**Confirming would be born with no producer — the stage=4 defect reborn on day one** —
and **Confirmed would need new engine semantics minted just to fill a display cell.**
The proposal's back half (Aging/Extended/Invalidated) meanwhile duplicates taxonomy 3
(`overtime` / `at_t2`-texture / `invalidated`), which is already computed, published, and
graded. The six-state enum as specified fuses the front half of one live axis (admission
lane) onto the back half of another (management phase) and adds two producer-less cells.
Refused. What ships instead is §6.

**Rider (no dead vocabulary):** PR-0(c) deletes the two never-assigned constants. A
vocabulary value with no producer is how the estate got an unlightable dot; we do not
keep two more in stock.

---

## §3 Ruling (i) — two dimensions, ratified; and what the "lifecycle" actually is

Packet §1 is ratified: `lane` (price/entry read) and conviction/lifecycle are separate
axes; settled by construction.

Sharper than the packet: the proposed lifecycle is **the Prophet funnel position** — one
chronological axis a tracked name moves along:

```
union early signal (watch deck) → plan armed (pre_trigger) → entered
(triggered_pre_t1) → delivering (at_t1/between_t1_t2/at_t2) → overtime |
invalidated → resolved (closed, graded)
```

Every segment of that arc **already has a computed, published producer**: the deck half
is #5370's union admission (`intake.early_turn_watch`, `deck_admitted`), the plan half is
taxonomy 3 (`phase`), and the terminal is `closed` + the graded ledger. Nothing needs to
be invented; the lifecycle needs to be **projected**, not minted.

The **admission lane** (EARLY vs confirmed; operator scoring ruling 2026-08-11) is a
*different* axis — which door and which score family a row belongs to — and stays a fact
column/chip. It never becomes ladder cells: one axis per control (Sol clause 2's
partition law), and its own contract forbids blending.

---

## §4 Ruling (ii) — what survives, what retires

| Construct | Verdict | Grounds |
|---|---|---|
| `lane` (engine field, ledger rows, ranking input) | **SURVIVES UNCHANGED** | it is a real classification with a real job; recutting it would be a data migration with zero display need (§8) |
| 4-dot rail + `_STAGE_BY_LANE` + int `stage` | **RETIRES at board migration** | §1.1–§1.2: two structurally unreachable steps, unlabeled 0-state, and categorically-false progression framing. Not hot-fixed before migration: any interim relabel mints vocabulary #8 and re-breaks Sol's law |
| `phase` (taxonomy 3) | **SURVIVES as engine truth** | already the management contract; slugs remain forbidden at glance tier; `lifecycle_state` is its only public face |
| triage buckets (taxonomy 2) | **SURVIVE on the candidate screener** | they partition a different universe (tonight's candidates, not the Prophet book) and already carry ratified plain-word EN/ZH labels that never say "stage" |
| `early_turn.stage` fact column | **SURVIVES** (EARLY chip/badge + deck sort context) | operator-ratified 2026-08-11; renders as a badge, never as ladder cells |
| `STAGE_CONFIRMING` / `STAGE_CONFIRMED` | **DELETED** (PR-0(c) rider) | never assigned; §2.4 |
| six-state `lifecycle_state` enum as literally specified | **REFUSED** | §2.4; replaced by the derived projection in §6 |
| Weinstein `stage_detailed`, `stage_tilt` | untouched | internal / separate program (`DNR:HOLD-PSQ-TILT-CLOCK`) |

---

## §5 Ruling (iii) — surface ownership

| Surface | Owner dimension | Form |
|---|---|---|
| **Prophet Board count ladder** (docket item 6) | `lifecycle_state` | the §6 cells; canonical total printed once; ladder filters on `data-life`; URL fragment `#life=<cell>` — **this supersedes P0 §B acceptance 3's literal `#stage=confirming` on both counts** (no `#stage=` fragment, no `confirming` cell) |
| **Prophet card lifecycle vocabulary** (§G.1) | `lifecycle_state` | the lifecycle word/fact column on cards; the dated lifecycle rail at detail scale. **§G.1 concurrence: GRANTED**, conditions in §10 |
| **Price/entry read** | `lane` | demotes to a mark chip ("Bottoming entry / 底部入场" · "Continuation entry / 顺势入场" — final chip copy is the designer's within these facts; **no recovery chip** — `recovery` has no producer (§1.1) and a producer-less chip is the §2.4 defect) + LENS receipt; never a progress control |
| **Candidate screener** (us-standouts section, wherever the migration keeps it) | triage buckets | shelf grouping + filter as today; its counts are a different noun (**Candidates / 候选**) and must never visually merge with the ladder's Setups total (Sol clause 2) |
| **Plan detail / LENS** | `phase` + `human_state`/`pulse` | receipts tier; Extended-type texture (e.g. "Extended — Watch Giveback") lives here and at hover, never as a ladder cell (it is a thresholded judgment inside `at_t2`, not a fact) |
| **Terminal deck** | admission lane (`EARLY`) + geometry | unchanged; its own contract |

---

## §6 THE CELL SET — `lifecycle_state` (the §J.9(c) deliverable)

**Unit of account (declared, binding):** a lifecycle cell counts **plan rows** — the
plan is Prophet's unit of inventory (each row is a separate tracked commitment with its
own entry, invalidation, and grade; `id` is unique 140/140 on the live payload) — except
`watch`, which counts **tickers with no open plan row** (a watch state precedes any
plan, so it has no plan row to count). One ticker can honestly occupy two cells at row
granularity (live example: FBRT — one closed 07-13 plan in `resolved`, one open 08-05
plan in `ready`; 13 of 127 tickers carry two rows today). Consequences, both binding:
- **The migrated Prophet Board renders one card per PLAN ROW** (keyed by plan `id`;
  `data-ticker` stays an attribute for the live-quote JS). Two FBRT cards — one resolved
  episode, one live plan — is the honest rendering of two separate commitments, and it
  is the only rendering under which ladder counts, `data-life` filters, and visible
  cards agree exactly (the chip-count law, `dashboard.html.j2:15962-15965`).
- **Ticker-keyed surfaces** (the landing showcase, stock-detail and dossier Prophet
  chips — one card/chip per name) use the per-ticker projection: **the cell of the
  newest open plan row (by `recorded_at`, tie-break `id`); else `watch` if the ticker
  is in the watch set (a live fire outranks a finished episode); else `resolved`** —
  single-valued per ticker, test-pinned (§9).

**Universe** = the published Prophet book: every row in `site/prophet/index.json.plans`
(the active book, `active_count`) **plus** every deck-only watch ticker. Archived plans
(`plan_count` − `active_count`; 162 − 140 = 22 today) are ledger population, quoted by
the track-record surfaces, never ladder-counted.

**Derivation** — total by construction at each unit:

```
per plan row (first match wins → disjoint; terminal else-arm → exhaustive):
  1. closed == True                             → resolved
  2. phase == "invalidated"                     → invalidated
  3. phase == "overtime"                        → overtime
  4. phase in {"at_t1","between_t1_t2","at_t2"} → delivering
  5. phase == "triggered_pre_t1"                → entered
  6. phase == "pre_trigger"                     → ready
  7. anything else (unknown/absent phase)       → ready  + ::warning receipt
     (an unknown state is never advertised as further along — the same rule
      stage_for() applies to unknown triage states)

watch set (ticker-granular, disjoint from the open book by construction):
  intake.early_turn_watch  MINUS  {ticker of any OPEN plan row}
     (minus OPEN — not any — rows: a fresh union fire on a name whose only
      plans are closed is a live watch state, not a resolved one)
```

**The cells** (funnel order, left → right on the ladder):

| # | Key | EN | ZH | Fact it states | Producer (all live today) | Count on the 2026-08-10 payload |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `watch` | **Watch** | **观察** | early signal fired on a scored candidate; no open plan | `intake.early_turn_watch` (#5370) minus open-plan tickers | 0¹ |
| 2 | `ready` | **Ready** | **就绪** | plan is live; entry trigger has not fired | `phase=pre_trigger`, open | 56 |
| 3 | `entered` | **Entered** | **入场** | trigger fired; in the entry window, pre-T1 | `phase=triggered_pre_t1`, open | 65 |
| 4 | `delivering` | **Delivering** | **达标** | at or past the first target | `phase∈{at_t1, between_t1_t2, at_t2}`, open | 1 |
| 5 | `overtime` | **Window Elapsed** | **窗口已到期** | the declared window elapsed and no closing print has arrived | `phase=overtime`, open | 0² |
| 6 | `invalidated` | **Invalidated** | **失效** | invalidation level hit; thesis void | `phase=invalidated`, open | 2 |
| 7 | `resolved` | **Resolved** | **已结** | closed — graded out (win, loss, or expired) | `closed=True` | 16 |

Check against the live payload — **two invariants, both binding**:
- **live total** (the P0 headline "N setups today", the answer to "live setups"):
  watch+ready+entered+delivering+overtime+invalidated = 0+56+65+1+0+2 = **124 =
  `open_count`** ✓ — `resolved` is deliberately **outside** the headline total, because
  `active_count` is a documented misnomer (`build_prophet.py:2120-2125`: it "count[s]
  every plan the management engine could state, INCLUDING forward-ledger-closed ones")
  and a headline that counts 16 graded-out plans as inventory sells non-actionable
  states (P0 §B red-team #6).
- **grand total**: all seven cells = 140 + watch = `active_count` + watch ✓ (phase ×
  closed cross-census: `pre_trigger` 56/2, `triggered_pre_t1` 65/2, `at_t1` 0/1,
  `between_t1_t2` 1/5, `invalidated` 2/6, open/closed respectively).

¹ `watch` is 0 on this payload because `build_prophet.py`'s intake export is a **closed
key-by-key whitelist** (`:2137-2230`) that does not yet pass `early_turn_watch` through
— the bridge computes it (`prophet_bridge.py:4752`) and no bake can publish it until the
exporter names it. That pass-through is PR-0(c) item 1a (§9); the bridge-side producer
is merged and live (#5370). **Builder rule:** on a payload with no `early_turn_watch`
key, the watch cell renders as a disclosed absence ("watch tier publishes from the next
nightly"), never as a silent 0 — key-absence and zero are different facts.
² `at_t2` is zero today but has a real producer — honest inventory. `overtime` is zero
for a **structural** reason, corrected by the §13 amendment (2026-08-13): the phase fires
at `tau > 1.0` while the closure scan retires the plan at `days >= horizon_days` on the
**same clock**, so on a plan with live prices `overtime` can only become true on a row
the ledger has already closed — and `closed=True` wins the partition at rung 1. The cell
is reachable **open** only when the price frame stops printing (a halted/delisted name),
which is what the corrected EN/ZH label states. It is a producing cell, not a dead one,
but its open population is a data-staleness set, not a timing set. Do not "fix" the count
by deriving it from `age_days > horizon_days` — see §13.

**Label rationale (binding):**
- ZH is a native two-character arc — 观察 · 就绪 · 入场 · 达标 · 超时 · 失效 · 已结 — not
  translated English. 失效 converges with the shipped invalidation vocabulary (失效价:
  "Base broken — thesis void level hit" / "筑底破位 — 失效价已触发",
  `build_prophet.py:345`); 已结 converges with the shipped pulse terminal ("closed ·
  stopped out" / "已结 · 止损离场", `build_prophet.py:1350-1354`); 超时 converges with the
  shipped phase word (`:1151`); 入场 is the estate's standard word for entry (513
  template hits vs 19 for 进场 — the ladder must not mint the minority form); 就绪 is
  reused from the retiring rail and 观察 collides with the retiring lane-heading label —
  both made safe only by the §10 sequencing conditions.
- "Invalidated/失效" complies with the falsifier-language law (operator 2026-07-27,
  #3821): it names the plan's own stated invalidation level being hit — a fact about the
  plan the user was shown — and both words already ship on the card. "Falsifier fired /
  证伪" remain banned.
- "Extended" is deliberately **not** a cell: it is `p1 ≥ 1.5` texture inside `at_t2`
  (`_human_state`, `prophet_management.py:1090-1091`) — a thresholded judgment, and the
  ladder is a fact partition. It stays hover/receipt tier, alongside the existing `ext_z`
  chase flags.
- "Aging" (the proposal's word) is rejected for `overtime`: the fact is a declared
  window expiring, not gradual decay. **"Overtime" is also rejected (§13 amendment,
  2026-08-13)** — it reads as "still running, in extra time", which is the one thing an
  open `phase=overtime` row never is: its window is gone and the only thing outstanding
  is the closing print. The engine's shipped words moved with this ruling
  (`_human_state` → "Window Elapsed — Awaiting Close", `_PHASE_WORD["overtime"]` →
  "window elapsed"/"窗口已到期"), so the cell label and the card word still converge.

**Count law (Sol clause 2, made mechanical):** `build_prophet.py` publishes a
`lifecycle_counts` block (`{watch, ready, entered, delivering, overtime, invalidated,
resolved}` + `lifecycle_live_total` + `lifecycle_grand_total`) computed in the same
pass that stamps per-row `lifecycle_state`. **`lifecycle_live_total` (the six live
cells) binds the P0 headline** ("N setups today"); `resolved` renders as the ladder's
terminal cell or an adjacent quoted count — either satisfies clause 2 because both read
from the same block; that choice is the designer's. Every rendered quantity quotes the
block or a difference of its values. CI mutates one row's state (flip `closed`) and
asserts the block moves — the counts may not be derivable-but-unchecked (the
receipt-from-the-same-variable trap).

---

## §7 Naming-law compliance (Sol: two concepts may never ship under `stage`)

Today the estate ships **four different concepts under the literal field name `stage`**
(census rows 1, 2, 4, 5) — and one of them (row 5) renders the word **"Stage / 阶段"**
directly to users with its own count chips. Disposition:

| Concept | Machine name today | Ruling |
|---|---|---|
| public lifecycle | — | **`lifecycle_state`**, DOM `data-life`, URL `#life=` — the only vocabulary ever *called* a lifecycle on Prophet surfaces |
| card int rail | `stage` (int) | field + rail retire at migration; the inline map duplicate at `dashboard.html.j2:16016` dies with it |
| candidate triage | `stage` (str) / `data-stage` | labels already never say "stage" to users; machine rename `data-stage` → `data-triage` rides the board-migration PR (fossilized snapshots are NOT rewritten — §8); until then it is an internal name, not a shipped semantic |
| stocktable lane re-map | `stage` (str, `ENTRY/RIPENING/RAN_LATE/KNIFE`) + label "Stage / 阶段" | **retires at the board migration** (§10.6): the label is the law's directest violation, its chips are counts outside the count law, and its `RIPENING` arm is producer-less (§1.1) |
| admission lane | `early_turn.stage` | survives (operator-ratified fact column); rename to `admission_stage` is a **non-blocking rider** on the next bridge-touching PR, coordinated with the Terminal (it consumes the payload — `charting-app lib/flowSource.ts` maps `prophet_idx` → `prophet/index.json`) |
| Weinstein | `stage_detailed` | internal, never rendered — outside the law's shipping scope |

**The word "stage" retires from all user-facing Prophet vocabulary** — labels, URLs,
aria, marketing copy. The glance-tier words are the cell labels themselves.

---

## §8 Migration and ledger constraints

- **No lane recut.** This ruling deliberately leaves `lane`'s values untouched, so the
  board ledger (`snapshots.jsonl` per-row `lane`, one row per as_of×lane×ticker×horizon
  in the grade parquets) needs **no migration**. Any future lane recut remains a data
  migration per the packet's §3 constraint — unchanged, just not triggered.
- **Fossils are never rewritten.** Historical snapshots keep the int `stage` and old
  labels as written; consumers of history read era-appropriately (house law).
- **`lifecycle_state` is additive** and display-tier: it enters the plan exporter via
  the **optional-fields path with a schema version bump and manifest regen** — the
  exporter's own documented law for additive keys (the #5395 J-15 lesson: putting an
  additive key in required fields ships a contract violation that reads green only while
  the manifest is stale).
- **Comment heals:** `grade_us_board.py:756`'s domain comment (`'trend' | 'recovery' |
  None`) is corrected to the real domain (`bottoming | continuation | watch | leader |
  ran | None` — `recovery` retained only if its producer is ever un-stubbed;
  `us_board_rank.py:2134` writes `lane="ran"`), and `_prophet_card.html.j2:55-56`'s
  `stage_key` comment gains the missing `basing` value — both in PR-0(c).
- **Documented, not touched:** `retro_grades.parquet`'s `lane` column is board-list
  membership (`buy/watch/laggards/leaders`), a different vocabulary from the row's entry
  lane under the same name. Recorded here so no consumer conflates them; renaming a
  parquet column is a migration this ruling does not order.

## §9 PR-0(c) — the implementable spec this ruling unblocks

Scope (all in `scripts/build_prophet.py` + `engine/us_early_turn.py` + tests; display
tier; no engine judgment changes):

1. Emit `lifecycle_state` per plan row per the §6 derivation (precedence order verbatim;
   unknown-phase arm emits a `::warning` line — bare `print(..., flush=True)` at line
   start per the annotation law).
   **1a.** Add `early_turn_watch` to the intake exporter's whitelist
   (`build_prophet.py:2137-2230` currently drops it — §6 fn.1), sourcing the BRIDGE's
   `list[str]` (never `basket_score`'s same-named `list[dict]`, §2 note c), with a
   pass-through test — the closed whitelist is exactly the silent-sibling shape that
   kept the watch producer dark.
2. Emit the `lifecycle_counts` block + `lifecycle_live_total` + `lifecycle_grand_total`
   on the index (optional-fields + version bump + manifest regen).
3. Ship the EN/ZH lexicon as paired constants (the §6 table verbatim; both languages
   all-or-nothing).
4. Delete `STAGE_CONFIRMING` / `STAGE_CONFIRMED` (§2.4 rider).
5. Heal the two stale domain comments (§8: `grade_us_board.py:756`,
   `_prophet_card.html.j2:55-56`).
6. Tests: (a) partition law — every plan row maps to exactly one cell,
   `lifecycle_live_total == open_count + watch_count`, and
   `lifecycle_grand_total == active_count + watch_count`, mutation-checked (flip one
   row's `closed`, assert the block moves); (b) no-dead-cell law — every non-`watch`
   cell's phase set is a subset of `prophet_management._VALID_PHASES` (pins the cells to
   producing values; if a phase is ever removed, the cell census goes red rather than
   silently zero); (c) key-absence vs zero for `watch` (§6 footnote 1); (d) lexicon
   pairing (no EN without ZH); (e) per-ticker projection is single-valued (§6 unit of
   account — FBRT-shaped fixtures: one open + one closed row).

Explicitly **not** in PR-0(c): any template/rail change, any `data-stage` rename, any
lane change, any Terminal change. The field ships dark; surfaces adopt at migration.

## §10 Board-migration gates (§G.1 concurrence — granted with conditions)

The design packet's §G.1 default (the lifecycle lexicon re-cuts the card rail; the price
read demotes to a LENS receipt) is **concurred**, with binding conditions:

1. **Same-PR retire:** any surface that gains the ladder or lifecycle labels retires the
   old 4-dot rail *in the same PR*. Two lifecycle vocabularies may never co-render on
   one card (§G.1's own law) — and 就绪 is reused by §6, so an old rail saying 就绪
   (=continuation lane) beside a ladder saying 就绪 (=armed plan) would be a live
   contradiction during any split rollout.
2. **Scope:** this ruling governs the US Prophet estate. `pv_card`'s int-rail contract is
   shared by `hk/china/canada/intl` templates (e.g. `china.html.j2:3551` hardcodes
   `'stage': 4`), so the macro grows a lifecycle variant behind a parameter; other
   markets keep the legacy rail until their own program lanes adopt this cell set —
   convergence is the default expectation, divergence needs its own ruling.
3. **The ladder counts the book, not the screener — and the board must therefore RENDER
   the book.** These are inseparable: on the live estate the us_stocks card grid is
   built from candidates (`dashboard.html.j2:15842-15862` reads `_su.buy`), the plan
   book is rendered by **no macro template at all**, and the two populations barely
   overlap (127 plan tickers vs 69 buy rows, intersection 35). A ladder that counts
   plans while filtering candidate cards would put ~75% of its counted population
   off-page and ~50% of visible cards outside its count — violating P0 §B acceptance 1
   and the board's own standing law that "a filter chip whose number disagrees with
   what filtering shows is a defect" (`dashboard.html.j2:15962-15965`).
4. **Gate (the migration's structural act): the Prophet Board's card grid re-sources
   from the plan book** (`site/prophet/index.json.plans`, one card per plan row per §6)
   in the same PR that introduces the ladder; the candidate screener (us_standouts buy
   rows, triage shelves, lane headings) moves to its own clearly-labeled section or
   page under the noun **Candidates / 候选** with its own printed-once total. **P0 §B
   acceptance 1 is amended accordingly:** Setups (ladder), Groups, and Candidates are
   three governed populations, each with one canonical total; acceptance 3's
   `#stage=confirming` is superseded by `#life=<cell>` (§5). One-referent-per-page word
   law: 观察 (and any other cell word) may carry only one meaning per page — the
   screener's watch-lane heading relabels or lives strictly inside the 候选 section
   (designer's choice within that constraint).
5. **The stocktable "Stage / 阶段" column** (§2 row 5) retires from the US board in the
   same migration — its label is the naming law's directest violation and its chips are
   counts outside the count law (§7).
6. **The P0 §0 weight-encoding law re-maps.** Its visual grammar (dashed → half-filled →
   solid → muted → hollow/struck) was written against the refused six-state enum; the
   designer re-issues it over the §6 cells (a natural mapping exists — watch dashed,
   ready half, entered/delivering solid, overtime muted, invalidated hollow/struck,
   resolved neutral — but the visual call is design's, not this lane's).
7. **Interim defect disposition:** the shipped rail's unreachable dots stand as a
   documented defect until migration — an interim relabel is refused (it would mint
   vocabulary #8). This is a scheduling argument for docket item 6, not a hotfix ticket.

## §11 Out of scope / follow-ups

- `stage_tilt` (`DNR:HOLD-PSQ-TILT-CLOCK`) and the two-track-record discrepancy — Sol's
  J-queue, untouched.
- `early_turn.stage` → `admission_stage` rename — non-blocking rider (§7).
- CN/HK/Canada rail adoption — per-market program lanes (§10.2).
- Full-universe intake (deck beyond `union ∩ candidates`) — separately chartered (#5370).
- Archived-plan surfacing (162 vs 140) — track-record surfaces own it.

## §12 Panel completeness and red-team record

Prepared by the Prophet program lane (the deciding party) with source + live-payload
verification of every claim above. Red-teamed by an independent Opus reviewer before
publication (adjudication coverage gate); verdict SHIP-WITH-FIXES, all findings
incorporated: 3 blockers (the watch cell's exporter gap — the whitelist drops
`early_turn_watch`, fixed as §9.1a; unit-of-account ambiguity — 140 plan rows vs 127
tickers, 13 duplicated, fixed by the declared unit + per-ticker projection in §6; the
board-renders-candidates / ladder-counts-plans mismatch, fixed by §10.3-4), 6 material
findings (stage=2 also structurally unreachable; the seventh vocabulary — the
stocktable "Stage / 阶段" column; `active_count`'s documented misnomer → the two-total
law; the 失效价 receipt mis-cited; 进场→入场 convergence; the 观察 lane-heading
collision), and 8 minor/nit corrections (citation drift, comment-heal scope, P0
acceptance supersessions, weight-encoding re-map, CN stage-4 hardcode scoping). The
reviewer's independent census reproduced the ledger history (828 buy rows, zero
trend/recovery), the phase×closed cross-census, and the dead-constant claim exactly.

The motivating exemplars were run: the live board (69 rows), the live book (140 plans,
127 tickers), the anonymous landing showcase (12 cards), and the full v1 ledger history
(18 snapshots) — the cell set covers all of them with zero unmapped rows at the declared
units.

## §13 Amendment (2026-08-13) — the Overtime/horizon reconciliation

**Question referred:** 16 open plans sit past their declared horizon and none produces
`phase=overtime`. Producer defect, or vocabulary defect?

**Ruling: vocabulary defect.** The 16 are correctly not overtime, the engine transition
is correct as written, and it is the §6 gloss (corrected above) that was wrong. Nothing
in the phase detector, the horizon clock, or the closure gate is changed by this
amendment. What changed: the EN/ZH cell label, footnote ², the "Aging" rationale, the
management engine's own plain words, and the one place a surface was quoting a
non-commensurable age.

### 13.1 The two clocks (this is the whole finding)

| Fact | Anchor | Producer | Units |
|---|---|---|---|
| `age_days` (published on every row) | `signal_date` → `observed_date` → `_signal_date` → `formation_date` | `build_prophet._age_days` (`:1208`), called at `:1888` | calendar days |
| `days_elapsed` / `tau` (the horizon clock) | `plan_clock_date()` = `price_basis_date` → `entry_date` → `asof` → `signal_date` | `prophet_management` `:196,216,258` | calendar days |
| horizon expiry (closure) | **the same** `plan_clock_date()` | `build_prophet._determine_outcome` `:844,882` | calendar days |

Both are calendar days — **there is no trading-day conversion anywhere in this path**, so
no unit mismatch exists to fix. The divergence is the *anchor*. `signal_date` is a
formation/event anchor that may precede the plan's own existence by months
(`plan_clock_date`'s docstring: "Reading it FIRST is the defect this function exists to
fix" — it once graded ledger rows on bars that predated the plan and made 14 plans born
past horizon). The horizon, τ, the phase, the confidence, the recommended action and the
EXPIRED/NO_ENTRY close **all** read `plan_clock_date`. `age_days` alone reads
`signal_date`.

So "open past declared horizon" computed as `age_days > horizon_days` is comparing an age
on one clock to a horizon declared on another. It is not a weaker test of the same fact;
it is a different fact.

### 13.2 The 16 counterexamples, replayed through the real engine

Every one of the 16 was replayed against its committed `site/prophet/states/<id>.json`
(the management engine's own output, asof 2026-08-13) and its `site/prophet/plans/<id>.json`
clock. Result: **τ ranges 0.0222 → 0.7333. Not one is past its declared horizon.**
`_first_t1_ts` is `null` on all 16, so the `not t1_hit` leg is satisfied for all of them
— **the sole transition preventing `phase=overtime` is `tau > 1.0`**
(`prophet_management._detect_phase:504`), and it is preventing it correctly.

| plan | `age_days` | clock anchor (rung) | `days_elapsed` | τ |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `PINS-BULL-20260227` | 167 | 2026-07-29 (`asof`) | 15 | 0.333 |
| `GPK-BULL-20260407` | 128 | 2026-07-20 (`asof`) | 24 | 0.533 |
| `RH-BULL-20260417` | 118 | 2026-08-08 (`entry_date`) | 6 | 0.133 |
| `AZO-BULL-20260625` | 49 | 2026-07-11 (`asof`) | 33 | 0.733 |
| … 12 more, all τ < 1.0 | | | | |

Max τ across the **entire** live book — 154 open plans and 20 closed — is **0.8222**. No
plan has ever been observed at τ ≥ 1.0 in a published state.

### 13.3 Why the cell is structurally near-empty (footnote ², corrected)

Both authorities read the same clock, and their boundaries are one day apart in the
direction that makes the phase unobservable on an open row:

- closure: `days >= horizon_days` → `EXPIRED` (triggered) or `NO_ENTRY` (untriggered)
  (`build_prophet.py:893,934`)
- overtime: `tau > 1.0`, i.e. `days > horizon_days` (`prophet_management.py:504`)

Boundary replay through both real functions (continuous session grid, clock 2026-06-01,
horizon 45):

| asof | days | τ | `phase` | closure |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-15 | 44 | 0.978 | `triggered_pre_t1` | — (open) |
| 2026-07-16 | 45 | 1.000 | `triggered_pre_t1` | **EXPIRED** |
| 2026-07-17 | 46 | 1.022 | **`overtime`** | EXPIRED (already closed) |

The phase becomes `overtime` exactly one day **after** the ledger has already closed the
plan — and rung 1 of the §6 partition (`closed == True → resolved`) wins, while
`_plan_pulse` suppresses the phase leg entirely on a closed row. So on a plan with live
prices, `overtime` is a post-closure state that no surface can ever display.

This is **not** an off-by-one to be repaired by moving either boundary. Closure cannot
fire before a bar prints (it needs a close price to grade), so the lag between "the
calendar passed the horizon" and "a session printed to close it" is irreducible. The one
case where that lag is unbounded is a price frame that stops printing — a halted or
delisted name — and that is the only way an **open** row reads `overtime`:

| case | τ | `phase` | closure |
|---|---|---|---|
| stale frame, horizon+1 | 1.022 | **`overtime`** | — (still open) |
| stale frame, horizon+20 | 1.444 | **`overtime`** | — (still open) |

Hence the corrected label: **Window Elapsed / 窗口已到期** — "the declared window elapsed
and no closing print has arrived". "Overtime/超时" was rejected because it reads as *still
running, in extra time*, which is the one thing such a row is not.

### 13.4 What the phase was historically intended to mean

`_detect_phase` is a port of MomoEdge `oracle_spec.md` §V2 step 3
(`research/momoedge/oracle_spec.md:259`): "`overtime` — `tau > 1.0 AND first_t1_ts ==
null` (horizon exceeded, T1 never hit)". MomoEdge is a **browser tick-state** system with
**no closure authority** — a plan there simply keeps being managed past its horizon, and
`overtime` exists to *de-rate confidence* on a stalled position (its ceiling band drops to
35–50, `oracle_spec.md:376-378`, ported at `prophet_management.py:880-882`). Prophet added
a closure authority that retires plans at the horizon. The port kept the confidence
de-rating — which still works — but inherited a *lifecycle* reading that Prophet's closure
contract does not support. §6 then published that inherited reading as a user-facing cell.
That is the defect this amendment closes.

### 13.5 Binding consequences

1. **`lifecycle_counts.overtime` MUST derive from `phase == "overtime" AND NOT closed`**
   — the §6 derivation as written. It may **never** be derived from
   `age_days > horizon_days`, `age_days >= horizon_days`, or any other re-derivation of
   "past horizon" from a signal-anchored age. Pinned by
   `tests/test_prophet_overtime_horizon_reconciliation.py`.
2. **No surface computes its own Overtime state.** A surface that wants "how far through
   its window is this plan" reads the row's `clock_age_days` (added by this amendment) or
   `geometry.horizon_pct_used` from the state — both are the engine's own τ clock.
   `age_days` remains published and remains the **signal's** age; it is not commensurable
   with `horizon_days` and must not be compared to it.
3. **The pulse's age leg now speaks the horizon clock.** It quoted `age_days`, so
   `PINS-BULL-20260227` pulsed "167d · pre-trigger" on a row whose own state said 33.3% of
   a 45-day window was used. That juxtaposition is what generated this referral.
4. **`recommended_action` for `overtime` is unchanged** (`"trim"`,
   `prophet_management.py:1137`). It is engine truth and out of scope for a vocabulary
   ruling — but flagged: on the stale-frame case it is a live instruction derived from a
   price that has stopped updating. Follow-up, not a fix ridden here.
