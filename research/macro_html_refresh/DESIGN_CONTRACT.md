# macro.html full UI refresh — design contract (mockup-adjudicated)

**Status:** mockups approved-pending-operator; implementation NOT started.
**Date:** 2026-07-10 · Program: Weather-Station design-framework rollout (framework shipped in #2180 `macro_context.html`).

## Deliverable
Rebuild `site/macro.html` (produced by `scripts/build_site.py`, mode "macro") onto the Weather Station design framework, following `mkv_final.html` in this directory (open in a browser; theme toggle included). It was produced by a judged two-variant competition + steal-list merge:

- `mkv_brief.html` — "one-glance brief" (won trader-UX 42/50: hierarchy + simplicity)
- `mkv_deck.html` — "full-parity deck" (won design 41/50: parity + polish)
- `mkv_final.html` — **the binding hybrid**: brief's IA + deck's parity content in a detail tier

## Binding design rules (from the judge panel)
1. **Single-dial discipline** — the 77 verdict is the ONLY circular dial; Q1/Goldilocks is a KPI chip, never a second hero card; no mid-page composite gauges.
2. Upper fold (~1000px) = hero + TODAY band; density resumes below the fold.
3. Catalysts split into two actionability tiers: TODAY (breaking-slug, hot) vs THIS WEEK (muted rail).
4. Policy-lever/repricing/flip-confirmation: labeled rows + delta chips, not raw tables.
5. Cross-asset strip: level + direction arrow + one-word context per tile (never color-only checks).
6. AI Daily Brief carries a visible badge: "display-only synthesis of existing signals — not a signal source" (house law: LLMs never originate signals).
7. News rows carry date + impact chips.
8. One chip vocabulary (color-mix tints), one gauge idiom (bar fill), theme.css tokens, aurora, 900px collapse — identical to `templates/macro_context.html.j2`.

## Implementation constraints (recon'd)
- Producer is `scripts/build_site.py` (~line 3446+, writes macro.html directly; also caches a VM for `scripts/render_macro_fast.py` — use that DEV harness for fast template iteration).
- `scripts/check_ms_board_coherence.py` guards the market-state boards on this page (verdict/score/thesis invariants) — keep board data contracts intact.
- Page hosts live overlays (`live.js`/`live_config.js`), the release-radar modal + tab strip, and alert popovers — all must survive the reskin.
- Bilingual EN/ZH throughout; no CJK/t() in `title=`; `check_nav_gap` requires ≥14px top gap (body padding-top).
- macro.html is also hit by the `-X theirs` render-resurrection failure mode — hand-transplant deltas, never regen intraday from stale data (see memory `render-resurrects-stale-site-text`).

## OPERATOR RULING — 2026-07-10 (supersedes parts of the hybrid contract above)
Deep integration, not overhaul, SHIPPED on this basis:
- The ORIGINAL Market State board — verdict hero with score progress bar, six-factor Evidence rows, multi-timeframe tape, Macro Backdrop/Goldilocks card — is RETAINED in original form. Do not re-propose compacting/demoting it.
- The heatmap (`#heatmap-scorecard`) is retained untouched.
- NO KPI chip strip in the hero (mx-kpi-strip removed). The mx hero = gradient headline + single dial + legs grid + flip-condition strip only.
- Everything else (policy band, release-radar chrome, AI brief card + display-only badge, sector heat, sentiment band, cross-asset tiles, index health grid, news chips, link-out strip) uses the mx framework.

## OPERATOR RULING — 2026-07-11 (v2 FULL TRANSITION — supersedes the deep-integration ruling above)
Operator: the old dashboard "has too much data, is too crowded, is too wordy, and is a layout mess with many useless data points. Do a full transition to yours instead... front end should be simplistic... advanced technical data hidden away through hover options or pressing."
BINDING DESIGN = `v2_final.html` in this directory (judged 43/50 over a hover-first variant; expand-first, touch-native):
- ONE-screen collapsed row-ledger front: hero (gradient headline = thesis · score panel containing the big numeral + progress bar + tick · dominant-driver card) then one-line rows: EVIDENCE / EVENTS / MARKETS / RISK / POLICY / AI BRIEF / NEWS / DEEP CONTEXT.
- ALL advanced data lives in press-to-expand trays (250ms choreography, staggered entrances, Expand-all pill w/ rotating chevron, localStorage state, Escape, keyboard Enter/Space, visible chevrons).
- NO "Hover for…" copy anywhere (touch-honest); one affordance verb.
- The old Market State board layout is RETIRED; its content maps to: score panel (verdict+score+bar+tick), EVIDENCE tray (six factors), RISK tray (radar+sentiment), hero context (dominant driver). The "board is the hero" ruling of 2026-07-10 is superseded.
- Heatmap lives inside the MARKETS tray (legible, labeled, as-of stamped).
- Every tray carries as-of stamps; AI brief keeps the display-only-synthesis badge; drawdown ladder keeps its measurement caveat.

## Heads-up chip mapping (v2)
- fed_stance + turning_point → RISK tray chips (sx-risk-v2 top area, above scares ladder)
- event_risk → EVENTS tray (sx-events-v2)
- 2026-07-11 rebase adjudication: the Risk-Radar banner card + the new Ignition-Radar card (#2229) render at the TOP of the RISK tray (glance state stays on the summary row) — neither is dropped, neither returns to the front surface.

## OPERATOR RULING — 2026-07-11 (v3 ISLANDS — content redesign + 3D container-island interaction)
Operator: v2 trays shipped with transplanted legacy content ("really bad") and flat expansion made section context unclear. BINDING DESIGN = `v3_final.html` (judged: dimensional-lift base 43+42/50, glass grafts):
- Pressing a ledger row expands IN-FLOW (never a popup) AND lifts the section into a 3D container island: elevated (translateY/scale/rotateX fractional), tri-layer shadows + backdrop blur (dark), per-section accent token (--isle-*: evidence teal · events amber · markets blue · risk red · policy violet · brief green · news/deep slate) driving border + promoted island header + colored under-glow floor; siblings dim/recede (opacity .45, desaturate, scale .998).
- ALIVE: 5-6s breathing bob + glow pulse + 14s aurora edge drift (NO continuous spinning borders); prefers-reduced-motion = static elevation.
- Expand-all = 80ms cascade of individual islands; body.many-open (≥3 open) halves glow mass so the all-open page stays calm.
- ALL tray contents rebuilt to mockup grade (no legacy chrome transplants): evidence factor rows w/ direction badges + axis bars + subtexts, events day-cards + release-radar card chrome + fed strip, markets index-health cards + hot/cold sector columns + heatmap + 8 asset tiles, risk scare rows + drawdown boxes + sentiment decomposition, policy lever cards, brief reading card, news impact-dot rows, deep-context icon chips.
- Operator granted full autonomy to completion (2026-07-11) — no approval gates for this program.

## OPERATOR RULING — 2026-07-11 (v4 SCORECARD GRID — grid default, ledger behind a toggle)
Operator: the v3 collapsed ledger "feels lackluster … requires additional UX steps to open each
tab"; wants "minimalist simple block scorecards like a personal dashboard … see all the details
all at once but in a medium detail way", press a card to expand to higher granularity; keep the
minimalist ledger as a settings toggle; grid is the version to perfect first, ledger gets a
feature-sync later.
BINDING DESIGN = `v4_final.html` (= `v4_state_board.html`, winner of a judged 3-way competition
47+45/45+43 unanimous, + ratified grafts). Full build contract, card content derivations, graft
list, and the 52-finding v3 audit fix list live in **`V4_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md`** (binding):
- Verdict band: THE REGIME (ms-verdict contract intact) · THE RISK (dominant driver + scare
  ladder + what-faded, press → risk island) · WHAT TO DO (deterministic stance rows — engine
  fields / fixed vocab keyed to engine enums only; LLMs and free-authored advice banned).
- Instrument rack: medium-detail card faces (evidence 6-factor rows, events, markets, policy,
  ai-brief, news, deep-context) sharing the v3 island trays — one DOM, two views; in-flow
  expansion to full row width; sibling dim; 3px left accent edge on --isle-* tokens.
- Grid = default view; `[Grid | Ledger]` segmented toggle in the topbar persisted to
  localStorage `mx4_view`; ledger view stays pixel-faithful to v3 (only audit fixes land there).
- v2/v3 rulings above remain binding for the ledger view and the island idiom.

## OPERATOR RULING — 2026-07-11 (v5 VISUAL LANGUAGE — aurora-glass hybrid; supersedes v4's skin, keeps its IA)
Operator vetoed the v4 grid's visual execution ("really ugly … cheap … so much text and no
illustrations") and, from a judged 5-theme competition (T1 seamless-terminal · T2 observatory ·
T3 instrument-cluster · T4 editorial-ledger · T5 aurora-glass), ruled a HYBRID — overriding the
judges' T1/T4 preference: **T5 Aurora Glass is the base language** (static aurora field ≤12%,
glass cards, verdict-color accent, gauge hero), grafting T5's hero/factor-breakdown/scare-ladder
(ladder upgraded to T3's dominant-risk anatomy: big driver numeral + graded value meters),
T1's 60-session score path, T2's card treatments for What-to-do / Risk-radar / Events, and
T3's fed probability instrument (donut + histogram) / catalysts week-rail / sentiment dial /
action-directive rows / news delta.
BINDING = `v5_final.html` (composed + adversarially reviewed 2026-07-11; "reads like a
billion-dollar product"). Hard laws baked into it, binding for production wiring:
- No outer container panels — content composes on the canvas; glass cards are ONE elevation.
- Every metric is a STATIC declarative SVG/CSS instrument (JS may only toggle theme/views —
  a verdict gauge must never blank on a script failure). No emoji, no icon fonts, no sub-11px
  text, tabular numerals, one as-of stamp, bloom restraint (one text-glow max), no decorative
  motion (`prefers-reduced-motion` kills the rest).
- No invented numbers: every printed value must exist in engine output (the sentiment dial
  shows the zone word keyed to real data, never a fabricated score).
- Production wiring notes: replace `background-attachment:fixed` aurora with a fixed-position
  pseudo-element (mobile-Safari + full-page-screenshot artifact); drop the sector-chip
  duplication between the Events card and Sector Temperature card; refresh the as-of from real
  state; both themes + EN/ZH; v4's expansion trays and [Grid|Ledger] toggle remain.
