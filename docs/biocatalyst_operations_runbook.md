# BioCatalyst Operations Runbook

Status: the B1 source-state lane, authenticated B1b read surface, bounded B2
Record History adapter, B4D prospective ledger, B4E root-sealed R2 activation
control, and the T1a explicit protocol peer matrix are implemented locally but
**dark by default**. API/UI
presence does not imply that live evidence exists. No Prophet signal, ranking,
trade authority, or Neural Web decision authority is asserted by this document.

## 1. Scope and ownership

The first operable slice is a source-canonical ClinicalTrials.gov source-state
lane for an explicit NCT canary allowlist. BioCatalyst owns exact raw
ClinicalTrials.gov response objects, sanitized fetch receipts, source snapshots,
an allowlisted read projection, immutable local/R2 retention receipts, and
bounded operational health.

B2 adds an opt-in Record History evidence adapter for exactly the same NCT
allowlist. It owns exact private index/version bytes, pre/post index receipts,
version-bound historical source snapshots, replayable exact diffs, neutral
registry-change facts, and a sanitized per-trial read model. The adapter does
not infer why a registry field changed, when a real-world event occurred, or
whether a change is clinically or financially material.

Named operational owner: `mastermindx_platform_ops`.

The owner is responsible for source etiquette, service health, watermarks, storage retention, replay, incidents, and disabling publication when completeness cannot be established. Domain interpretation remains outside the worker.

This slice does not own company identity, a security master, SEC or issuer
documents, cash/runway, financing, saved queries, watchlists, Neural Web
authority, Prophet selection, Terminal user state, observations, or diffs. The
executable boundaries live in `config/sector_intelligence_ownership.yml`.

## 2. B1 topology and arming boundary

The reviewed, operator-installed units are:

- `macro-biocatalyst.service`: one-shot canary poll and projection publish;
- `macro-biocatalyst.timer`: hourly trigger with randomized delay; and
- existing `macro-api.service`: read-only authenticated product API.

The worker is disabled by default. Explicit operator arming requires:

1. `BIOCATALYST_ENABLED=1`;
2. a non-empty `BIOCATALYST_CANARY_NCTS` allowlist;
3. a descriptive `BIOCATALYST_USER_AGENT` with an operator contact;
4. the dedicated `BIOCATALYST_R2_*` credential set scoped to BioCatalyst only;
5. writable worker state and public-generation directories;
6. the isolated `/opt/macro-biocatalyst/current` runtime passing its
   conditional-create capability check; and
7. an initial complete run whose raw pages, receipts, snapshots, and counts
   reconcile.

`BIOCATALYST_HISTORY_ENABLED` is a separate optional switch and defaults to
`0`. Setting it to `1` is permitted only after the
`clinicaltrials_gov_record_history` source-registry entry is changed through
review to allow production ingestion, the undocumented source-shape canary
passes, and an exact canary run survives private replay. Arming B1 does not arm
B2. The Record History adapter must stay disabled while its source-registry
entry says `production_ingest_allowed: false`.

`BIOCATALYST_PROSPECTIVE_ENABLED` is also separate and defaults to `0`. B4D
collection with that switch set to `1` requires the B4E root-sealed activation
gate and a fresh root-written heartbeat described in section 14. The collector
locally validates both artifacts against its exact R2 account, endpoint,
bucket, jurisdiction, and worker credential identity before it creates an
attempt directory, constructs a source collector, or constructs an R2 store.
`BIOCATALYST_R2_RETENTION_CONFIRMED=1` is deprecated compatibility evidence
only: it is parsed for a bounded configuration error, but it cannot authorize
prospective collection. Removing the prospective switch after a v1.3 or later
generation exists fails closed rather than silently dropping or resetting its
ledger.

Before the lane is provisioned, the macro API's BioCatalyst sandbox paths use
systemd's optional-path prefix so their absence cannot prevent the serving API
from starting. After setup creates the state, public, and environment paths,
the next macro API restart enforces the read-only public mount and hides worker
state and credentials exactly as specified.

The worker is not attached to the nightly GitHub Actions collector, render lane, or intraday forward-ledger jobs. Those lanes cannot satisfy the two-hour source freshness target and must not become a second scheduler.

### B1 deployment and arming boundary

The isolated deployment entrypoint is `app/deploy/biocatalyst-setup.sh`. It must
run as root on the VPS. Idempotently it creates the static, non-login
`macro-biocatalyst` user and primary group; makes the top-level state anchor
`root:macro-biocatalyst` mode `0750`; makes only its state and public children
service-owned with mode `0700`; and creates or corrects
`/etc/macro-biocatalyst.env` as `root:root` mode `0600`. The systemd manager
reads that environment file before dropping privileges; the worker identity
cannot open it as a file.

State, public, staging, committed, dead-letter, and environment provisioning is
performed by `app/deploy/biocatalyst-secure-paths.py` through directory-relative
file descriptors with `O_NOFOLLOW`. Every managed anchor must be the expected
directory or regular-file type. A pre-created symlink, a file in place of a
directory, FIFO, socket, or device aborts setup without chmod/chown touching its
target.

The runtime parent is `root:macro-biocatalyst` mode `0750`. Setup calls the
shared `app/deploy/biocatalyst-runtime.sh` transaction: dependencies are built
inside a fresh versioned virtualenv, the botocore `PutObject.IfNoneMatch`
capability is verified, and only then is `/opt/macro-biocatalyst/current`
atomically switched to the candidate. Runtime contents remain root-owned and
group-readable/executable, never service-writable. A failed build or capability
check leaves the last-good `current` target selected. Setup validates the units
with `systemd-analyze verify` when available and installs them, but does **not**
enable or start either unit.

Before root executes a selected runtime, the secure-path helper reopens the
runtime root, version directory, stamp, `bin`, and copied Python executable with
no-follow semantics. It rejects ownership drift, group/world-write bits,
non-regular executable or stamp files, unsafe tree entries, escaping symlinks,
or a changed `current` target. A rejected selected runtime is rebuilt in
staging; it is never executed as root merely because its requirements stamp
matches.

The service runs as `macro-biocatalyst` with no ambient or bounding
capabilities. `ProtectSystem=strict` keeps the host filesystem read-only except
for explicit state and public `ReadWritePaths`; the secret environment file is
inaccessible inside the service mount namespace. Kernel, device, home,
namespace, process-view, realtime, and address-family restrictions further
bound the one-shot worker.

Populate the root-owned env file with the three named worker controls above and
the BioCatalyst-scoped object-store endpoint, bucket, access key, and secret.
Then use `biocatalyst-setup.sh --verify-prereqs`; this check reports only missing
key names, never their values. After the initial complete-run verification, an
operator explicitly arms the hourly timer with:

```bash
systemctl enable --now macro-biocatalyst.timer
```

`app/deploy/update.sh` reconciles reviewed units and the pinned dedicated
runtime only when **both** units and an isolated runtime already exist on the
host. A requirements change uses the same build-verify-atomic-swap transaction;
it never runs pip inside the selected runtime. Unit replacement is gated on a
verified `current` runtime. The updater never creates an absent lane, writes
credentials, enables a timer, or starts the collector. When the timer is already
enabled, it is restarted only to load a reviewed timer-unit change;
worker-level non-blocking locking remains the authority for overlap prevention.

## 3. Canonical storage

Private evidence key namespace mirrored immutably after a reconciled run:

```text
biocatalyst/raw/clinicaltrials/v2/version/{yyyy}/{mm}/{run_id}/{before|after}/{exact_response_sha256}.json
biocatalyst/receipts/clinicaltrials/version/{yyyy}/{mm}/{run_id}/{before|after}.json
biocatalyst/raw/clinicaltrials/v2/pages/{yyyy}/{mm}/{run_id}/{page_ordinal}/{exact_response_sha256}.json
biocatalyst/receipts/clinicaltrials/{yyyy}/{mm}/{run_id}/{page_ordinal}.json
biocatalyst/runs/clinicaltrials/{yyyy}/{mm}/{run_id}.json
biocatalyst/raw/clinicaltrials/v2/{nct_id}/{canonical_content_sha256}.json
biocatalyst/source_snapshots/clinicaltrials/{nct_id}/{source_snapshot_id}.json
biocatalyst/mirror_receipts/{run_id}.json
biocatalyst/raw/clinicaltrials/history/{nct_id}/index/{exact_response_sha256}.json
biocatalyst/raw/clinicaltrials/history/{nct_id}/version-{source_version}/{exact_response_sha256}.json
biocatalyst/receipts/clinicaltrials/history/{yyyy}/{mm}/{run_id}/{receipt_id}.json
biocatalyst/runs/clinicaltrials/history/{yyyy}/{mm}/{run_id}.json
biocatalyst/source_snapshots/clinicaltrials/history/{nct_id}/{source_snapshot_id}.json
biocatalyst/derived/clinicaltrials/history/{nct_id}/diffs/{diff_payload_sha256}.json
biocatalyst/derived/clinicaltrials/history/{nct_id}/facts/{fact_payload_sha256}.json
```

Only a complete, independently revalidated private tree is conditionally
created and read back in the dedicated R2 bucket. A malformed HTTP-200 body is
instead retained under the attempt's local dead-letter tree for bounded
diagnosis, using these hash-addressed evidence keys:

```text
biocatalyst/raw/clinicaltrials/v2/failed-fetch/{yyyy}/{mm}/{run_id}/{endpoint}/{attempt}/{exact_response_sha256}.bin
biocatalyst/incidents/clinicaltrials/{yyyy}/{mm}/{run_id}.failed_fetch_{endpoint}_{attempt}_{digest_prefix}.json
```

Failed-fetch evidence does not mint a successful receipt, enter the reconciled
R2 mirror transaction, or advance the public pointer. B1 therefore makes no
durable-R2 claim for this local diagnostic retention; a future quarantine
mirror requires a separately reviewed lifecycle and access policy.

VPS state:

```text
/var/lib/macro-biocatalyst/state/staging/
/var/lib/macro-biocatalyst/state/committed/{run_id}/private/
/var/lib/macro-biocatalyst/state/committed/{run_id}/incidents/
/var/lib/macro-biocatalyst/state/dead-letter/
/var/lib/macro-biocatalyst/state/biocatalyst_worker.lock
```

The `/var/lib/macro-biocatalyst` anchor is owned by
`root:macro-biocatalyst` with mode `0750`. Its `state` and `public` children and
the managed state subdirectories are owned by
`macro-biocatalyst:macro-biocatalyst` with mode `0700`; no other service gets
write access.

Atomic read projection (the public root contains no raw response, receipt,
snapshot, private object key, absolute filesystem path, or credential):

```text
/var/lib/macro-biocatalyst/public/current.json
/var/lib/macro-biocatalyst/public/generations/{run_id}/manifest.json
/var/lib/macro-biocatalyst/public/generations/{run_id}/source_manifest.json
/var/lib/macro-biocatalyst/public/generations/{run_id}/trials/{nct_id}.json
/var/lib/macro-biocatalyst/public/generations/{run_id}/trial_snapshots/{nct_id}.json
/var/lib/macro-biocatalyst/public/generations/{run_id}/history/{nct_id}.json
/var/lib/macro-biocatalyst/public/generations/{run_id}/protocols/{nct_id}.json
/var/lib/macro-biocatalyst/public/generations/{run_id}/health.json
/var/lib/macro-biocatalyst/public/health.json
```

`current.json` is the only commit pointer. A complete immutable generation is
installed and revalidated before that pointer advances; the root `health.json`
is mutable operational status and is written only after pointer success.

Full raw objects, tokens, private object keys, absolute filesystem paths, and
credentials never enter the B1 public projection. Repository data is limited to
bounded synthetic or redacted fixtures.

Public source states carry only opaque source-snapshot IDs and content-addressed
source-record IDs. Before publication, the worker independently reloads the
private run, every ordered receipt, exact page body, canonical per-study object,
and source snapshot. It rejects missing or extra private files, validates byte
counts/hashes, pagination, raw-derived counts, snapshot coverage, and the exact
allowlisted public-state fields before any private R2 write or public pointer
advance. Fact-state taxonomies, observations, and diffs are B2 work, not B1.

Generation schema `1.1.0` adds a separately versioned `trial_snapshot.v1`
product projection under `trial_snapshots/`. It is built only after the private
source snapshot has passed the evidence replay, copies the contract's exact
allowlisted ClinicalTrials.gov paths with explicit missingness, and remains
`current_only` source fact with no decision authority. The serving API exposes
an even narrower response DTO and strips opaque snapshot/content identifiers.
Historical observations, semantic change interpretation, issuer identity,
probability, valuation, and signal authority remain outside this projection.

Generation `1.4.0` adds immutable, pointer-bound
`protocols/{nct_id}.json` `trial_protocol_projection.v1` artifacts beside the
same-generation trial snapshots and history. Each is built only from a
validated private source snapshot plus validated public trial snapshot. Its
arm groups use the closed `label`, `type`, `description`, and
`interventionNames` shape with item/list/string caps; unknown upstream keys do
not cross the boundary. Generation `1.5.0` is the current superset of `1.4.0`:
it retains the protocol layout and also carries the B4D prospective artifacts.
Both schema generations are source-fact only and have no peer relationship,
identity, ranking, or decision authority.

## 4. Source and version semantics

ClinicalTrials.gov API v2 is treated as a current-state source. B1 stores the
source state it actually retrieved; it does not claim historical coverage or
interpret the registry's `LastUpdatePostDate` as when BioCatalyst knew a fact.

The upstream dataset is generally refreshed once each weekday, while the
BioCatalyst canary checks hourly. The two-hour budget describes worker
operations after a source refresh; it is not a claim that ClinicalTrials.gov
publishes hourly. Each run preserves both exact `/version` response bodies and
sanitized, hash-bound before/after receipts, including the API version and
`dataTimestamp` exactly as supplied. B1 never uses that raw value for elapsed
freshness arithmetic. An
explicit-offset value is checked against the worker clock with a 36-hour future
poisoning guard; an offset-less value is compared only as UTC-shaped civil time
without silently assigning an upstream timezone. ClinicalTrials.gov attribution
and BioCatalyst's normalization disclosure remain on every public source state.

ClinicalTrials.gov's public product exposes prior submitted study versions.
B2 reads the UI-backing `/api/int/studies/{NCT}?history=true` index and exact
`/api/int/studies/{NCT}/history/{version}` objects. These are undocumented
interfaces, not the supported v2 API, so their shape is canary-gated and their
ETag is never treated as a freshness or content-identity signal.

A complete B2 attempt fetches the history index, fetches only the exact version
IDs listed by that index, then fetches the index again. The two index bodies
must describe the same ordered manifest. Missing, duplicate, reordered,
fabricated, or gapped versions; an index race; a source-shape change; or any
receipt/raw-byte mismatch quarantines the candidate. The current bounded
contract requires a zero-based contiguous chain; it never fills a gap by
requesting an unlisted version.

Registry version submission dates are source dates, not BioCatalyst knowledge
timestamps and not proof of real-world event timing. B2's only public event
semantics are exact before/after registry field values grouped by submitted
version. Every fact remains `source_fact`, `current_only: false`,
`decision_authority: false`, and usable only for display, context, or
explanation.

The worker stores two distinct hashes:

- exact response-body SHA-256 for archive integrity; and
- canonical per-study JSON SHA-256 for source-state identity.

Canonical study hashing sorts object keys and preserves array order. Retrieval
time belongs in the receipt, not in the content hash. The exact page-response
object retains the original private response bytes so its response hash can be
replay-verified; the sanitized receipt stores only pagination-token hashes. A
malformed HTTP-200 `/version` or `/studies` body is retained as a local private
failed-fetch artifact and bounded incident, never as a successful receipt or
part of the reconciled R2 mirror transaction.

Every live run also records a deterministic digest of the collector parser,
shared CT.gov relational validator, and the schemas that govern the run,
receipt, and source snapshot. The worker and offline replay reject a run whose
digest does not match the executing code surface.

The B1 current-state projection remains `current_only`; poll frequency and
elapsed service time never promote it. A B2 history read model is available
only when its entire version chain is independently replayed from private raw
evidence. If B2 is disabled or a refresh fails, publication may carry forward
only the byte-identical prior, pointer-bound, already validated history model.
With no last-good model it publishes an explicit bounded `unavailable` state.

Permitted product language:

> ClinicalTrials.gov's registry record changed; first observed within this interval.

Forbidden from this slice:

- “the protocol changed”;
- “the trial halted on” a registry update date;
- “the site activated” from a newly listed location;
- “enrollment accelerated” from a changed count;
- “complete historical record”; and
- any probability, materiality, ranking, gating, sizing, or trade recommendation.

## 5. Run transaction

Each poll is a bounded transaction with one immutable run receipt.

1. Acquire the non-blocking worker lock and load only a fully validated current
   generation as the prior watermark.
2. Collect the exact CT.gov v2 canary pages and stage private evidence plus a
   collector-public projection outside the real public root.
3. Require `canary_poll`, the exact configured NCT universe, and the exact
   API-root/path/base-query wire binding before any R2 write.
4. Independently reload the run, ordered receipts, exact page bodies, canonical
   per-study objects, and complete source-snapshot set. The worker calls both
   the reusable publication context and `validate_ctgov_publication_bundle`.
5. Reject changed source versions, pagination cycles, page-cap exhaustion,
   divergent duplicates, count mismatch, timestamp regression/future poisoning,
   omitted/substituted canary IDs, missing or extra private files, or any
   snapshot/public-state mismatch.
6. Mirror every exact private file to the dedicated R2 credential plane using
   conditional create plus byte-for-byte readback, then retain the same private
   tree locally under `committed/{run_id}`.
7. Persist a deterministic mirror receipt keyed by the run ID and read it back.
8. Build a sanitized, hash-complete public generation; revalidate it after
   install; advance `current.json` last; then best-effort write mutable health.

A partial, failed, or quarantined run cannot advance the watermark or replace a
good current generation. A post-archive failure leaves a bounded private
incident receipt linking the candidate run, R2 verification state, dead-letter
reference, and prior/observed pointer without exposing paths or secrets.

B2 exact registry diffs and neutral change facts are a separate evidence plane.
They do not alter B1 source-state watermarks and cannot substitute for missing
raw history evidence. The public projection excludes raw bodies, receipts,
object keys, filesystem paths, private source-snapshot JSON-pointer machinery,
private hashes, and credentials. The T1a response separately exposes only
registered official ClinicalTrials.gov API-v2 field locators under its closed
response contract; those locators are not storage paths or private handles.

## 6. Health and SLO accounting

The B1 operational health DTO exposes only these bounded fields: schema version,
state, enabled flag, generation ID, configured/observed NCT counts, last attempt,
last success, raw source timestamp, freshness budget, coverage class, and a
bounded error code. It deliberately does **not** claim pages, study changes,
source retrieval time, watermarks, consecutive misses, full reconciliations,
or parser/API versions as public operational fields yet.

Generation-local health is immutable and hash-bound beside its generation. Its
generation ID, configured/observed counts, raw timestamp, and last
attempt/success must match the generation manifest and validated projection. A
failed refresh that retains a prior pointer uses that prior generation's counts
and last-success value rather than fabricating candidate coverage. “Process
exited zero” alone is not a successful opportunity.

The worker persists `fresh`, `partial`, `quarantined`, or `disabled` as
appropriate. `fresh` is not perpetual: every API or product consumer must read
health through `PublicGenerationPublisher.read_operational_health`, which
strictly binds the mutable DTO to the validated current generation and derives
`stale` once the transaction-time `last_success_at` exceeds the 7,200-second
budget. The source's offset-optional `dataTimestamp` is never used for elapsed
freshness. This read-time downgrade does not mutate the retained health file.

An absent, malformed, symlinked, or pointer-divergent health surface fails
closed; consumers must not read `health.json` directly or preserve a cached
`fresh` label. `unavailable` remains reserved for a future authenticated API
adapter that can return a bounded no-generation DTO.

Only explicit transient availability failures are `partial`: HTTP transport or
unexpected status, bounded R2 read/create availability failures, and a pointer
write whose rollback was proven. Provenance, content, immutability, source
poisoning, configuration, and filesystem-boundary failures are `quarantined`.

## 7. Secrets and least privilege

Runtime configuration is held outside git. The worker receives only:

- `BIOCATALYST_ENABLED`;
- `BIOCATALYST_CANARY_NCTS`;
- `BIOCATALYST_USER_AGENT`;
- optional `BIOCATALYST_HISTORY_ENABLED`, which accepts only `0` or `1` and
  defaults to `0`;
- optional `BIOCATALYST_PROSPECTIVE_ENABLED`, which accepts only `0` or `1` and
  defaults to `0`;
- optional `BIOCATALYST_R2_RETENTION_CONFIRMED`, which accepts only `0` or
  `1` as deprecated evidence of an earlier retention review. It never
  authorizes a prospective run; only the root-sealed gate plus fresh heartbeat
  can do that;
- for prospective collection, `BIOCATALYST_R2_ACTIVATION_ID` and
  `BIOCATALYST_R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, which must match the root-controlled gate and
  control-plane account exactly; and
- for prospective collection, `BIOCATALYST_R2_JURISDICTION`, explicitly one
  of `default`, `eu`, or `fedramp`, so local target binding cannot silently
  substitute an endpoint jurisdiction; and
- `BIOCATALYST_R2_ENDPOINT`, `BIOCATALYST_R2_BUCKET`,
  `BIOCATALYST_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and `BIOCATALYST_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`; and
- the service-injected fixed state/public roots
  `/var/lib/macro-biocatalyst/state` and `/var/lib/macro-biocatalyst/public`.

The collector environment is exactly `/etc/macro-biocatalyst.env`, owned
`root:root` mode `0600`. It contains only the worker's data-plane configuration
and is loaded by the systemd manager before the service drops to
`macro-biocatalyst`. The worker cannot reopen either environment file in its
mount namespace. The root-only control environment is separately
`/etc/macro-biocatalyst-control.env`, also `root:root` mode `0600`; it holds
only the Cloudflare control/auditor token, control account ID, and fixed B4E
TTLs. It is loaded only by the root heartbeat service and is never supplied to
the collector.

The API process gets read access to the public projection only. It must not receive object-store write credentials. Receipts allowlist safe request and response headers and hash pagination tokens; they reject authorization, cookie, API-key, proxy-authorization, and set-cookie fields.

The worker-owned public root is an explicit single-writer trust boundary. Public
artifact, manifest, and pointer hashes detect corruption and cross-binding;
they are not a cryptographic signature against the authorized worker identity
or host root maliciously rewriting an entire internally consistent tree.
Evidence authenticity is established before promotion by replay against the
private source tree and verified R2 mirror. The API's read-only mount prevents
the serving process from becoming that writer. Suspected worker or host-root
compromise requires disabling publication and replaying from private evidence;
request-time hash validation alone is not sufficient recovery evidence.

The static worker identity has no login shell, no Linux capabilities, no write
access to application code or its versioned runtime, and no direct file access
to either environment file. Root remains the only principal that can change
credentials, runtime selection, systemd policy, the activation gate, or the
activation heartbeat.

Exact transitive dependency locking and bounded garbage collection for old,
unselected version directories remain deployment follow-ups. Until then,
requirements stay range-pinned and prior verified runtimes are retained for
manual rollback; neither limitation weakens the no-follow or atomic-swap gates.

## 8. Replay and correction

Replay reads immutable receipts, exact archived page/history bytes, canonical
content objects, and source snapshots into an isolated staging projection. It
must reproduce B1 source states and B2 history read models byte-for-byte for the
pinned parser version before an operator-approved promotion. Standalone schema
validation is insufficient; raw evidence, pre/post index agreement, per-version
bindings, snapshot relationships, diffs, and neutral facts are always
rechecked.

A parser upgrade creates a new parsed projection version. It does not rewrite a
raw source object. Corrections or supersessions mint new derived artifacts;
they never mutate prior snapshots, diffs, or facts.

## 9. Incident response

Disable publication when any of these occurs:

- repeated pagination token;
- configured page cap reached;
- divergent duplicate body for one NCT in one run;
- upstream timestamp regression outside tolerance;
- raw archive or receipt durability failure;
- projection publish failure;
- count reconciliation failure;
- future source timestamp outside tolerance;
- credentials or private storage coordinates detected in a receipt or response; or
- two consecutive missed opportunities.

Response:

1. leave the last-good projection intact;
2. mark health `partial` or `quarantined` with a bounded code;
3. retain the failed attempt/dead-letter material and, after private archive,
   write a bounded immutable incident receipt with mirror and pointer state;
4. stop watermark advancement;
5. diagnose against the exact run and page receipt;
6. replay into staging;
7. compare hashes and counts; and
8. resume only after a complete opportunity passes.

Rollback is a pointer change to the prior verified projection generation. Immutable source objects and receipts are never deleted during an incident.

## 10. B2 closure and next-lane fence

B1 can be operator-armed because NCT identity is source-canonical and the
source-state lane needs no company/security join. B2 history remains separately
dark until its undocumented source adapter clears the registry and canary gates
above. Full BioCatalyst parity remains open pending company/security identity,
SEC/issuer documents, cash and financing, clinical outcome labels,
regulatory/patent data, competitive intelligence, valuation/expected-value
models, market structure, and any Prophet or Neural Web authority contract. The
API and UI must omit those fields rather than synthesize substitutes.

## 11. B4A Drugs@FDA archive fence (dark)

B4A is a separate FDA-native transaction, not an extension of the B1/B2 trial
worker. Its future worker state, lock, raw namespace, derived generation, and
`current.json` are all under a dedicated regulatory state root. A failed FDA
archive can therefore never modify the ClinicalTrials.gov generation pointer,
trial health, worker lock, or API read surface.

The current `drugs_at_fda` registry entry is deliberately executable-dark:
`production_ingest_allowed: false`, `public_projection: blocked_until_review`,
and `BIOCATALYST_REGULATORY_ENABLED=0`. The separate
`scripts/biocatalyst_regulatory_worker.py` reads that registry before it can
open a network connection and rejects an attempted enablement. No B4A service
or timer is installed, enabled, or started by the existing BioCatalyst setup or
updater. An explicit source-rights advancement, dedicated state/R2 credentials,
source canary, replay review, and separately reviewed service/timer are all
required before any live collection.

When reviewed collection is eventually armed, one transaction must acquire the
official FDA data page before and after the exact `drugsatfda.zip` GET. It
retains exact page and ZIP bytes privately, validates the three HTTP receipts,
and identifies a release only by raw archive SHA-256. FDA's displayed “Data
Last Updated”, content-disposition token, Last-Modified header, and ZIP member
timestamps are descriptive metadata; none becomes a row effective time,
knowledge time, or release identity. The FDA page says the archive is updated
each morning Monday through Friday, but the worker must not infer a precise
publication time or assume one immutable release per day.

The private remote commit is intentionally source-evidence only: it must bind
and read back the exact landing pages, ZIP, canonical receipt, and twelve table
manifests before the local pointer advances. The release-local SQLite index is
derived, local, and rebuildable from that exact remote ZIP; it is not mirrored
through the current bytes-only object-store interface. A disaster rehydrate
must replay the remote ZIP and reconcile the committed table manifests before
installing a new local SQLite generation. Each table manifest also carries a
source-derived typed-row semantic digest; initial publication and crash recovery
must match the SQLite digest to that exact-member digest, so a locally rehashed
sidecar cannot become truth merely by rewriting its own metadata.

The 12 expected CRLF, tab-delimited tables are parsed as strict cp1252. ZIP
traversal/symlink/encryption/duplicate-name/member-count/size/compression-ratio
or row-count ceiling failures, unknown files, BOM/LF/header drift, duplicate or missing logical
primary keys, and undeclared row shapes all fail closed before a derived pointer
can advance. The sole currently reviewed row-shape exception is scoped to the
exact 2026-07-31 archive hash and one CRLF physical `ApplicationDocs.txt` line;
it removes only a known empty overflow field and records its line hash and
field counts in the private manifest. It is not a generic repair rule.

Referential closure is intentionally not a completeness precondition. Current
FDA data has source-native orphans and sentinel source text such as empty
`TECode`, literal `Null`, `UNKNOWN`, `N/A`, and numeric `0`. The parser retains
those exact values and counts unresolved links; it never fabricates a parent,
maps an FDA sponsor to a company/ticker, or discards rows merely to make a
graph look clean. The derived graph carries only FDA application/product,
submission/class/property, action, marketing-status, TE, and document facts.
It does not claim a pending application, PDUFA, IND, hold, CRL, approval odds,
medical meaning, trial/asset identity, or Prophet/Neural Web/trade authority.

The pinned 2026-07-31 witness archive `5ff17b3e…fb8092c53` contains 959,263
source rows. Its retained-orphan counts are products→application 11,
submissions→application 5,378, documents→application 3,
documents→submission 152, joins→submission 494, joins→action lookup 296,
marketing→product 599, properties→submission 256, and TE→product 12. These
values are a parser regression witness for that exact archive, not a promise
that future releases must have the same source-quality gaps.

B4A writes no product API or user-facing regulatory lens while public
projection remains blocked. A future reviewed FDA public-projection tranche
must construct a separately allowlisted, entitled, no-store public DTO from the
private, replay-bound generation and must omit raw object keys, local paths,
receipt bodies, physical line hashes, credentials, and internal storage
coordinates.

## 12. B4B registry milestones and B4C Registry Change Tape

B4B and B4C are entitled ClinicalTrials.gov read surfaces over the one
validated, pointer-bound public trial generation. They do not read B4A, private
receipts, raw source bodies, private derived facts, object-store coordinates,
or a second database. The API process remains read-only and every response is
`private, no-store`.

B4B exposes current-record primary-completion and completion fields through
`GET /api/biocatalyst/v1/trials/milestones`. Dates retain the source's day,
month, or year precision and its bounded `ACTUAL`, `ESTIMATED`, or `UNKNOWN`
type. A partial date appears only when its complete civil-date interval is
inside the selected window. The route does not call the date a catalyst,
readout, result, approval, or market signal.

B4C exposes display-safe Record History differences through
`GET /api/biocatalyst/v1/trials/changes`. It aggregates only complete,
validated `trial_history_read_model.v1` artifacts from the same committed
generation. Each row binds exact before/after values to consecutive display
versions, the after-version source-submission date and ClinicalTrials.gov
version URL, and the time the complete history was retrieved. Filtering by
trial title, NCT ID, sponsor label, phase, status, or condition uses the
current trial record and is identified as current-record selection; it does
not rewrite historical identity or facts.

The Record History adapter remains operator-review-gated in the source
registry. Where it is disabled or no complete previously verified chain is
pointer-bound, the route reports unavailable coverage and no change rows. The
existence of the product route does not advance source rights or authorize the
undocumented adapter. A later official-API prospective change ledger must use
the separate B1 observation interval and must not backfill that first-seen
clock from Record History submission dates.

The Change Tape interpretation ceiling is `registry_record_changed`.
`protocol_change_asserted` and `materiality_assessed` remain false. A changed
registry status, date, endpoint field, enrollment field, site listing, sponsor
label, or intervention field is not evidence that the real-world trial event,
clinical protocol, asset economics, company exposure, expected payoff, or
security outlook changed. Missing or incomplete history is counted as
unavailable and omitted rather than synthesized.

Both list endpoints paginate with endpoint-domain-separated HMAC cursors bound
to the normalized query and committed generation. A changed query is rejected;
a changed generation returns a restart response. `BIOCATALYST_CURSOR_SECRET`
may provide restart-stable cursor signing and must contain at least 32 UTF-8
bytes. Without it, a process-random key deliberately invalidates outstanding
cursors when the serving process restarts. Cursor syntax and signature are
authenticated before the public projection is read.

B4B and B4C remain source-fact display, context, and explanation surfaces with
no decision authority. They cannot originate, select, rank, size, gate, or
execute a trade and cannot raise their own authority. Saved cohorts, alerts,
and user watchlists belong to the Terminal user-state owner; BioCatalyst must
consume that seam when it is available rather than create a parallel store.
Issuer/security, asset, economic-rights, FDA-application, and ticker joins stay
absent until the Corporate Intelligence-owned, point-in-time identity bridge
has cleared its separate abstention and evidence gates.

## 12A. T1a explicit protocol peer matrix

`POST /api/biocatalyst/v1/trial-peer-sets:resolve` resolves a caller-supplied,
exact-uppercase list of 2–100 NCT IDs. It is an entitled `private, no-store`
facts-only comparison surface, not a peer-discovery system: cohort membership
is supplied by the caller, and the response asserts no clinical, commercial,
company, asset, security, or authority relationship among its rows. It cannot
rank, score, select, gate, or originate a decision.

The endpoint reads only `protocols/{nct_id}.json` and same-generation history
models from a committed public generation `1.4.0` or `1.5.0`. Generation
`1.0.0` through `1.3.0` lacks the protocol artifact contract and therefore
returns the coarse private `503` unavailable response rather than misreporting
all requested records as uncovered. A malformed, missing, tampered, or
over-cap protocol artifact also fails the request closed with that response;
the API never falls back to a private snapshot, raw source record, or a
secondary database.

Each rendered field evidence entry contains `source_field_locators`, not a
source object key or private JSON-path key. Values are an exact closed
allowlist of official ClinicalTrials.gov API-v2 `/protocolSection/...` fields
used by the projection. They must never contain a filesystem path, object-store
key, raw/archive/receipt identifier, snapshot reference, hash, arbitrary JSON
pointer, or private-source locator. The protocol artifact and peer response
both have aggregate byte ceilings; publication rejects oversized artifacts and
serving rejects an oversized response rather than emitting a partial result.

The route accepts at most 16 KB. Caddy applies an endpoint-scoped body cap,
and the application rejects an oversized declared `Content-Length` or streams
an undeclared/chunked body only until the same cap. Authentication is resolved
before any JSON decoding. After successful authentication, empty or malformed
JSON receives a private `400`; oversized input receives a private `413`.

Its `t1` HMAC cursor binds the sorted explicit cohort, requested page limit,
authenticated caller subject and tier, and committed generation. A changed
cohort, limit, caller, or tier receives private `400`; a changed generation
receives private `409` and requires restart. `BIOCATALYST_CURSOR_SECRET` may
make cursor signatures restart-stable when it has at least 32 UTF-8 bytes;
without it, process-random signing deliberately invalidates cursors on restart.

## 13. B4D official-v2 prospective change ledger

B4D creates a prospective, first-observed change ledger from successful polls
of the official ClinicalTrials.gov v2 API. It is independent of the
operator-gated Record History adapter. The first successful run in a coverage
epoch establishes a baseline observation and publishes zero change events. It
does not mine older B1 archives, Record History submission dates, source update
metadata, or any other retrospective record to manufacture an earlier clock.
The code path and entitled read surface can be deployed while dark, but the
worker must not create its first v1.3 baseline until
`BIOCATALYST_PROSPECTIVE_ENABLED=1` and the B4E root-sealed gate plus fresh
heartbeat are explicitly valid. The old retention boolean cannot substitute
for either artifact.

For every later successful observation, `observed_interval.after` is the prior
successful observation's `retrieved_at` and
`observed_interval.at_or_before` is the current source snapshot's
`retrieved_at`. The public `first_observed_at` is the latter bound. This means
only that the registry record first appeared changed to BioCatalyst somewhere
inside that interval. It is not the time a protocol, enrollment event, company
decision, clinical outcome, or market event occurred.

The worker revalidates both the prior committed private evidence and the
current run's private evidence before it computes a diff. Exact observations,
canonical snapshots, full JSON operations, content hashes, receipts, and
object references remain private and immutable. The public v1.3 generation
contains a separate `prospective/{nct_id}.json` read model with only bounded,
display-safe operations from a closed family allowlist. Unsupported `other`
operations and recursively unsafe or oversized values are omitted, and their
counts remain visible. Private source/object references, source-content hashes,
receipt hashes, and object hashes never enter the public artifact or API DTO.
The public artifact intentionally carries only its own `hash_scope` and
`model_payload_sha256` self-integrity fields; the entitled API validates and
redacts those fields rather than returning them to clients.

The prospective ledger is cumulative within one coverage epoch. If the
configured NCT scope changes, the new generation supersedes the old epoch and
starts a new baseline with zero cross-epoch events. The superseded epoch stays
immutable in its committed private archive and is inactive because the public
pointer no longer binds it; the worker does not rewrite it with a synthetic
closure time. Within an unchanged scope, missing, corrupt, or inconsistent
prior evidence fails the run closed: the worker must not silently reset the
baseline, skip the interval, advance the public pointer, or infer a replacement
observation. Failed collection, private archive, remote mirror, or pointer
installation similarly leaves the last-good generation intact.

`GET /api/biocatalyst/v1/trials/prospective-changes` is an entitled,
`private, no-store` read surface. Its window basis is
`observation_at_or_before_utc`, and its `p1` cursor domain is distinct from the
Record History endpoint. Current title, sponsor, phase, status, and condition
filters select current trial records only; they do not rewrite the identity or
timing of a prospective event. Before a v1.3 baseline exists, the endpoint
returns explicit unavailable or pre-baseline coverage and no synthesized rows.

The First-seen Tape may describe only `registry_record_changed`.
`protocol_change_asserted` and `materiality_assessed` remain false. The lane has
source-fact display, context, and explanation authority only: it cannot
originate, rank, select, size, gate, execute, or escalate a Prophet or Neural
Web decision. NCT ID is its sole entity identity. Company, asset, ticker,
economic-rights, FDA-application, valuation, and user-state joins remain with
their registered owners.

No data-generation garbage collector currently prunes the exact private
ledger or the public epoch history. Compaction or retention must be introduced
as a separately reviewed, provenance-preserving policy; it cannot be smuggled
in as routine staging cleanup. A single per-NCT read model currently stops at
2,048 events and fails closed rather than trimming; segmented, hash-linked
rollover and a capacity alert are required before broad long-lived coverage.
The current canary also rechecks the complete prior mirrored object inventory
on each same-scope poll. Before enabling large B2 history collections, replace
that bounded safety-first replay with a receipt-rooted verification plan that
reads only the B4D evidence required for continuation.

## 14. B4E R2 retention activation control (dark)

B4E is the activation guard for the B4D prospective ledger, not a data
collector. Its `check` operation is read-only against Cloudflare's control
plane and a data-plane `HeadBucket`; `seal` may create only a bounded R2
preflight receipt with conditional create and exact readback; `heartbeat`
rechecks that sealed receipt and both planes before writing a local status
artifact. None of these operations collects source records, accrues a ledger,
or advances a public pointer.

### Fixed local trust boundary

`app/deploy/biocatalyst-setup.sh` provisions these exact paths through the
no-follow secure-path helper. Setup installs both systemd unit pairs but
enables or starts neither timer.

```text
/etc/macro-biocatalyst.env                              root:root                  0600
/etc/macro-biocatalyst-control.env                      root:root                  0600
/var/lib/macro-biocatalyst                              root:macro-biocatalyst     0750
/var/lib/macro-biocatalyst/activation                   root:macro-biocatalyst     0750
/var/lib/macro-biocatalyst/activation/gate.json         root:macro-biocatalyst     0440
/var/lib/macro-biocatalyst/activation/heartbeat.json    root:macro-biocatalyst     0440
```

The collector runs as `macro-biocatalyst`. It can only read the two artifacts
from the root-controlled `activation/` directory; it cannot replace that
directory, the gate, or the heartbeat. Its service has read/write paths only
for `state/` and `public/`, marks `activation/` read-only, and makes both
environment files inaccessible. The root
`macro-biocatalyst-activation-heartbeat.service` instead loads both environment
files, has write access only to `activation/`, and makes worker `state/` and
`public/` inaccessible. The root heartbeat timer is hourly with up to 120
seconds randomized delay; it is installed disabled.

### Cloudflare conditions to verify externally

No Cloudflare token, bucket lock, lifecycle rule, or other external Cloudflare
state is changed by this repository or by B4E setup. Before an operator can
arm B4E, Cloudflare must independently provide all of the following for the
dedicated BioCatalyst bucket:

- The worker credential is an active token with exactly one `allow` policy:
  `Workers R2 Storage Bucket Item Write` on the exact bucket resource and no
  other permission group or resource.
- At least one enabled R2 bucket lock has `Indefinite` duration and covers
  every key under `biocatalyst/`. The verifier accepts that exact prefix or
  any ancestor prefix, including an empty bucket-wide prefix; neither a
  narrower prefix nor a finite lock is an authorization.
- No enabled lifecycle rule with a delete-objects transition overlaps the
  protected `biocatalyst/` namespace. A bucket-wide, ancestor, exact, or
  nested deletion prefix is disqualifying because each could delete at least
  one protected object.
- A preflight receipt can be conditionally created at
  `biocatalyst/activation-preflight/r2_preflight_<24-hex>.json` and read back
  byte-for-byte. The conditional, immutable R2 receipt—not a local boolean—is
  what the root-sealed gate binds.

The old `BIOCATALYST_R2_RETENTION_CONFIRMED=1` value is deprecated evidence of
an earlier operator review only. It cannot authorize collection, override a
missing lock, lifecycle delete rule, wrong token scope, stale gate, or stale
heartbeat.

### Root operator sequence

Keep both timers disabled until this full sequence has succeeded. Run commands
as root from `/opt/macro`. Do **not** shell-source a systemd `EnvironmentFile`:
values such as a descriptive user agent can contain spaces. Instead, define the
following non-executing loader once, then use it only inside a disposable root
subshell. It accepts only uppercase environment names, preserves the value as a
single quoted export, and neither evaluates a value nor leaves credentials in
the parent shell after the subshell exits.

```bash
load_biocatalyst_env() {
  while IFS='=' read -r name value || [ -n "${name:-}" ]; do
    case "$name" in
      ''|'#'*) continue ;;
    esac
    [[ "$name" =~ ^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*$ ]] || {
      printf 'invalid BioCatalyst environment name: %s\n' "$name" >&2
      return 1
    }
    export "$name=$value"
  done < "$1"
}
```

1. Populate the separate environments. The worker file receives its data-plane
   credentials and B4D controls, including
   `BIOCATALYST_PROSPECTIVE_ENABLED=1`,
   `BIOCATALYST_R2_ACTIVATION_ID` (after sealing), and
   `BIOCATALYST_R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, and
   `BIOCATALYST_R2_JURISDICTION` (`default`, `eu`, or `fedramp`). The control file receives
   `BIOCATALYST_R2_CONTROL_ACCOUNT_ID`,
   `BIOCATALYST_R2_CONTROL_API_TOKEN`,
   `BIOCATALYST_R2_ACTIVATION_GATE_TTL_SECONDS=86400`, and
   `BIOCATALYST_R2_HEARTBEAT_TTL_SECONDS=7200`.
2. In a disposable root subshell, load both files with that loader and run a
   read-only preflight. The subshell exit drops the exported worker and control
   values; run `unset -f load_biocatalyst_env` after the full procedure if the
   helper itself is no longer wanted in the parent shell.

   ```bash
   (
     set -euo pipefail
     load_biocatalyst_env /etc/macro-biocatalyst.env
     load_biocatalyst_env /etc/macro-biocatalyst-control.env
     cd /opt/macro
     /opt/macro-biocatalyst/current/bin/python -m scripts.biocatalyst_activation --mode check
   )
   ```

3. Seal immediately after a successful check. `seal` repeats the remote
   preflight, requires it to be no more than five minutes old, conditionally
   creates and reads back the R2 receipt, and writes the canonical gate JSON to
   standard output. Install that output atomically as the fixed root-controlled
   gate, then copy its `activation_id` into the worker environment:

   ```bash
   (
     set -euo pipefail
     load_biocatalyst_env /etc/macro-biocatalyst.env
     load_biocatalyst_env /etc/macro-biocatalyst-control.env
     gate_tmp="$(mktemp /var/lib/macro-biocatalyst/activation/.gate.XXXXXX)"
     trap 'rm -f -- "$gate_tmp"' EXIT
     cd /opt/macro
     /opt/macro-biocatalyst/current/bin/python -m scripts.biocatalyst_activation --mode seal >"$gate_tmp"
     chown root:macro-biocatalyst "$gate_tmp"
     chmod 0440 "$gate_tmp"
     mv -f -- "$gate_tmp" /var/lib/macro-biocatalyst/activation/gate.json
     trap - EXIT
   )
   ```

   Now extract the sealed identifier, edit the root-owned worker environment
   without evaluating it, and make the exact value check pass **before**
   starting the heartbeat service. This intentional pause prevents a heartbeat
   for one sealed gate from being paired with a different worker activation ID.

   ```bash
   activation_id="$(/opt/macro-biocatalyst/current/bin/python - /var/lib/macro-biocatalyst/activation/gate.json <<'PY'
import json
import re
import sys

with open(sys.argv[1], encoding="utf-8") as handle:
    value = json.load(handle)
identifier = value.get("activation_id") if isinstance(value, dict) else None
if not isinstance(identifier, str) or not re.fullmatch(r"r2_activation_[a-f0-9]{24}", identifier):
    raise SystemExit("sealed gate has no canonical activation_id")
print(identifier)
PY
)"
   printf 'Set this exact line in /etc/macro-biocatalyst.env with a root-safe editor:\nBIOCATALYST_R2_ACTIVATION_ID=%s\n' "$activation_id"
   read -r -p 'After saving that exact line, press Enter to verify it: ' _
   grep -Eq "^BIOCATALYST_R2_ACTIVATION_ID=${activation_id}([[:space:]]*)$" /etc/macro-biocatalyst.env
   unset activation_id
   ```

4. Create a fresh root-written heartbeat before touching the worker timer:

   ```bash
   systemctl start macro-biocatalyst-activation-heartbeat.service
   ```

   The service repeats the remote verification but does not collect source
   data. It atomically replaces only `heartbeat.json` after canonical contract
   validation.
5. Perform the no-I/O local target-binding check, then the setup preflight.
   Both must pass before arming:

   ```bash
   (
     set -euo pipefail
     load_biocatalyst_env /etc/macro-biocatalyst.env
     load_biocatalyst_env /etc/macro-biocatalyst-control.env
     cd /opt/macro
     /opt/macro-biocatalyst/current/bin/python -m scripts.biocatalyst_activation --mode validate \
       --gate-file /var/lib/macro-biocatalyst/activation/gate.json \
       --heartbeat-file /var/lib/macro-biocatalyst/activation/heartbeat.json
   )
   /opt/macro/app/deploy/biocatalyst-setup.sh --verify-prereqs
   ```

6. Arm the heartbeat first, then the ordinary worker timer; confirm both are
   enabled and active. This is an explicit operator action, never a setup or
   updater side effect.

   ```bash
   systemctl enable --now macro-biocatalyst-activation-heartbeat.timer
   systemctl enable --now macro-biocatalyst.timer
   systemctl is-enabled macro-biocatalyst-activation-heartbeat.timer macro-biocatalyst.timer
   systemctl is-active macro-biocatalyst-activation-heartbeat.timer macro-biocatalyst.timer
   ```

The independently configured gate TTL is exactly 86,400 seconds (24 hours).
The separate heartbeat TTL is exactly 7,200 seconds (two hours), bounded
further by the gate expiry. The hourly timer cadence does not extend either
artifact: reseal and install a new gate before 24 hours, then run the heartbeat
service and local target-binding verification again.

If B4D is enabled and the root-sealed gate, heartbeat, target binding, owner,
mode, receipt, or freshness check fails, the worker quarantines the run before
it creates an attempt directory, source collector, or R2 store. It leaves the
last valid public pointer intact, writes only bounded failure health where that
is safe, and cannot accrue a prospective observation or advance the ledger.
These failures are integrity/trust-boundary quarantine, not transient partial
collection. B4E does not relax source rights, entity ownership, Corporate
Intelligence's point-in-time issuer/security identity bridge, or the facts-only
Neural Web and Prophet authority fences.
