# Tier-preview pattern — how a paid page still gives Free something real

Ratified 2026-07-25 with the Special Situations gate (the reference
implementation). Read this before gating any other page.

## The problem it solves

Our page-level access control is all-or-nothing: `config/site_access.yml`
classifies a path `public | free_registered | premium | deny`, and once
`PAYWALL_ENABLED=1` a premium page answers a Free account with a 403
interstitial. That is the right control for a data artifact and the wrong one for
a product page — a visitor who never sees the desk work has no reason to pay for
it. The Research Vault already showed the better shape: everyone gets the newest
report, members get the shelf.

Two things make this non-trivial:

1. **Our desks are server-rendered.** Hiding rows with CSS or a JS tier check is
   a marketing wall, not a gate: the rows are still in the document, one
   `view-source` away. If the content is what you charge for, the shipped bytes
   have to differ.
2. **The paywall is still staged off** (`PAYWALL_ENABLED=0`, see
   `docs/ops/site-access.md`). Waiting for the site-wide launch to gate one desk
   is not an option, and arming the whole estate to gate one desk is worse.

## The shape

**Split the build. The split is the gate.**

```
site/<page>.html                     free-visible shell  ── free_registered
  · honest totals + methodology + a small, genuinely readable preview slice
  · an upgrade wall where the rest of the content would be
  · inert copies of the controls the paid board needs (see "controls" below)

site/premiumdata/<page>.json         paid payload  ── premium, enforced NOW
  · {schema: tier_payload.v1, gated, required_tier, built, …, *_html}
  · the rows/panels the shell does NOT contain, rendered from the SAME partials
```

At runtime the shell **attempts to hydrate**: it asks for the payload and, on
`200`, appends the rows, swaps the skeletons for the real panels, drops the wall
and re-enables the controls. On `403` the wall simply stays. No client-side tier
check is load-bearing — the server decides, every time, and a hostile client can
only ever ask.

### Why `/premiumdata/`

Caddy's static boundary is default-deny (`@reg_asset`), so a new prefix needs
**no Caddyfile change**: it already flows through `/api/regwall/check` then
`/api/paywall/check`. What it does need is `premium.enforced_early` in
`config/site_access.yml`, which makes `app/paywall.py` require the `site_full`
entitlement on those paths *regardless of `PAYWALL_ENABLED`*. That is the whole
mechanism for shipping one paid surface ahead of the launch switch.

Deploy is automatic: `app/deploy/update.sh` (cron, every ~3 min) restarts
`macro-api` whenever `app/*.py` or `config/site_access.yml` changes on main.

## Applying it to a page — the checklist

1. **Extract the repeated markup into a partial** (`templates/_<page>_rows.html.j2`)
   that renders nothing but the `rows` it is handed, and carries no tier logic.
   One source, rendered twice — the preview slice and the paid remainder can then
   never drift apart.
2. **Builder**: read the switch from `config.yml` (`gated`, `preview_rows`), split
   the rows, render the shell with the preview slice + a `gate` dict
   (`{tier, payload, preview, locked}`), and write the payload with
   `schema: tier_payload.v1`.
   *Choose the preview newest-first, not best-first* — show the desk working
   without handing over the ranked board. Prefer rows that read as product (a
   real ticker, a summary) over the literal newest filing.
3. **Template**: `{% if gate %}` → skeleton panels in place of paid ones, an
   upgrade wall (plain words, honest counts, `plans.html` CTA, a sign-in line for
   the signed-out member), and the attempt-hydrate script.
4. **Policy**: add the page path to `free_registered.exact` (otherwise an armed
   paywall 403s the preview itself) and confirm the payload prefix is under
   `premium.enforced_early`.
5. **Plans page**: state the boundary in the same PR — a tier card line *and* a
   comparison-matrix row. Free's cell says what Free actually gets
   ("3 newest filings"), never "—".
6. **Render lane**: make sure the page's builder actually runs in `render.yml`
   (the desk PAGE, not its slow collector) so a template fix reaches the baked
   shell in minutes. Reuse the last real build's `built` stamp on a no-refresh
   rebake so an unchanged desk rebakes byte-identically and commits nothing.
   **Guard the rebake against thinning** with `lib/desk_guard.py`: a no-refresh
   render reads the COMMITTED store, but a collector's `enrich_*` progress
   accumulates in the *nightly runner's* working copy and only a successful
   nightly `git add data/` publishes it. On 2026-07-25 that gap was three days
   wide and a `scope=sits` render on a fresh runner took the live desk from 1129
   situations to 641 — silently. The guard refuses any no-refresh rebake that
   would drop >25% of the SHIPPED row count (page rows + payload `locked`; never
   a `data/` snapshot, which is what went stale).
7. **Tests**: prove the split hermetically (fake rows → the shell contains only
   the preview), and assert the shipped bytes carry no payload row. Assert on
   full class attributes, never a bare selector substring — the page's own CSS
   mentions every skeleton class, so `"setup-ghost" in html` is vacuously true.

   **Key the leak check on the ROW, not the ticker.** These desks list
   *situations*, and one company routinely holds several: on 2026-07-25 HON had
   a June spin-off on the paid board while a July capital return sat in the free
   preview (80 other US tickers, and 2 Chinese ones, carried more than one locked
   row). A ticker seen on both sides of the wall is therefore not a leak — a
   shared *row* is, so compare rendered row identity (the card's whole `data-*`
   block; on China, the normalised row markup). Keying on the ticker both cries
   wolf whenever the preview slice happens to touch a repeated name — it went red
   on `main` and every PR that way — and silently exempts the ticker-less (`—`)
   rows, which are paid content too. Pair it with a coverage assertion
   (`len(keyed) == payload["locked"]`) so a markup change can never quietly turn
   the check vacuous, and a hermetic control that proves a duplicated row IS
   still caught.

### Controls (filters, search, sort)

Bake them **fully** and mark the container inert (`.gated` → `pointer-events:
none`, dimmed, and non-sticky on phones). Hydration removes the class and the
same controls start working on the full board. Do not omit them for Free — the
entitled viewer hydrates into the same DOM and would end up with no filters. Say
why they are inert with one plain line above the bar; dead buttons with no
explanation read as a bug.

### Session freshness (a trap worth remembering)

The shared session cookie carries a ~1h access token, so a long-idle member can
be signed in with a token the server will reject. Call
`MDXAuth.client().then(sb => sb.auth.getSession())` before the payload fetch to
refresh and rewrite the cookie — the same fix as the onboarding wall (PR #3454).
`theme.js` is deferred, so `MDXAuth` does not exist while an inline page script
runs: wait for its `mdx-auth` event with a timeout fallback.

### A shared partial has more than one host (a trap worth remembering)

Gating *a page* is not gating *the content*. `templates/_us_act_now_board.html.j2`
is rendered on us_stocks.html by `scripts/build_site.py` **and** on
sector_central.html by `scripts/build_sector_central.py`. PR #5846 gated the
us_stocks host; the second host passed no `pgate`, so it kept rendering all five
lanes in full and the gate moved the paid rows one click away instead of out of
the bytes. Measured anonymously the same day: 45 `.actitem` rows still served,
on a page that does not even load `tier_preview.js`.

So, before calling a desk gated:

    grep -rln "<partial>" scripts/ templates/

Every host in that list needs its own split, and each needs its **own payload**
when the hosts are built by different scripts at different times — two builders
writing one `/premiumdata/<page>.json` means whichever ran last silently
overwrites the other's rows. The row macros stay shared (one source, three
shapes: full / gated shell / rows-only), which is what keeps the two gated hosts
from drifting; only the split and the payload are per host.

The same question applies to the artifact behind the page: if the rows also ship
as JSON (`site/basketdata/action_board.json` here), confirm that URL's own class
— a gated page beside an anonymously readable payload is theatre.

## What each preview tier actually sees today

| Surface | Anonymous | Free | Insider | Pro |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| US Stocks | 1 item per list | 3 items per list per daily build | full book | full book |
| Special Situations | sign in | 3 newest filings, all totals, coverage note | whole board, top setups, search/filter/sort | same as Insider |
| China Special Situations | sign in | the whole overhang read + the 3 nearest unlocks and 3 newest letters | every named row on all 7 planes | same as Insider |
| Research Vault | newest 3 summaries | newest 3 summaries | newest 3 summaries | every desk, PDFs, Top Picks |

(The Vault draws its line at Pro, these desks at Insider — the pattern is the
mechanism, not the price point. The Vault's wall is also explicitly a *marketing*
wall, because its paid content is the PDF, which `app/research.py` gates
server-side; on a desk whose content is the rows, only the split works.)

### Where to draw the line on a multi-panel desk

The US desk is one flat feed, so "newest N rows" is the whole answer. The China
desk is eight panels with different shapes, and the useful split turned out to be
a different cut of the same idea: **state and totals are free, names are paid.**
Every panel keeps its header, glance sentence, status chip, as-of and count
("286 active buyback programs", "100 names on the risk-warning board") — a Free
reader gets a complete, honest picture of where the pressure is — and only the
per-name rows move behind the wall. Within that, the preview slice comes from the
two *newest-first* queues (nearest unlocks, newest inquiry letters); the ranked
"top N by magnitude" boards get no preview at all, because previewing a
best-first board hands over its head, which is the part people pay for.

Two traps that fall out of gating a multi-panel page:

* **Empty-state branches read the sliced list.** `{% elif not bt.top_premium %}`
  fires on the gated shell and shows "Nothing flagged" over content that exists.
  Guard every such branch with the plane's gate state.
* **A plane with genuinely no data must not grow a skeleton.** Pass the gate a
  `planes` list naming only the planes that actually have withheld rows in this
  build, and let the honest empty state stand everywhere else.

The two Special Situations shells are **anonymous-public** as of 2026-08-03
(PR #4337, SEO Supercharge W1a — `research/SEO_SUPERCHARGE_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md`):
the preview shell serves 200 to signed-out visitors and crawlers, while every
paid payload stays `premium.enforced_early` (verified live: 403 `x-paywall: deny`
anonymous). The US Stocks and Research Vault shells are likewise public
acquisition surfaces; their full/detail data remains separately gated. For the
SEO estate, new tier-preview conversions default to anonymous-public shells per
masterplan adjudication A1.

## Reference implementation

- `templates/special_situations.html.j2` — shell, wall, attempt-hydrate
- `templates/_special_situations_rows.html.j2`, `_special_situations_setups.html.j2`
- `scripts/build_special_situations.py` — `_gate_cfg`, `_write_premium_payload`
- `config/site_access.yml` — `premium.enforced_early`, `free_registered`
- `app/paywall.py` — `enforced_early()`
- `tests/test_special_situations_gate.py`, `tests/test_paywall.py`
- CI: the `tier-gate` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

Third application (a desk gated one panel at a time):

- `templates/dashboard.html.j2` (mode `stocks`) — `us_stocks.html`. PR #5840 split
  the ranked board (`us_standouts.buy`) out of the shell; the follow-up split the
  four panels around it, which are fed by *different artifacts* and so were never
  covered by the board's one-payload split.
- `templates/_us_board_cards.html.j2`, `_us_setups_rows.html.j2`,
  `_us_leader_rows.html.j2`, `_us_ran_rows.html.j2` — the extracted row partials.
- `templates/_us_act_now_board.html.j2` and `templates/_theme_tape.html.j2` render
  in THREE shapes from one set of macros (full · gated shell · rows-only/names-only
  for the payload) rather than growing a partial, because the act-now board is a
  **shared include** with a second host and the tape's lists sit inside nested
  loops the payload has to walk in the same order anyway.
- `scripts/build_site.py` — `_split_us_panels`, `_render_us_panel_payload`,
  `_us_tape_locked_count`, `_US_ACTNOW_LANES`.
- `tests/test_us_board_gate.py` (both halves: the import-light `tier-gate` lane
  and the fat "full page stack" lane).

Three things this application is worth remembering for:

* **One payload, many panels.** The withheld panels ride the board's existing
  `site/premiumdata/us_stocks.json` as extra `*_html` blocks rather than minting a
  file each. The page already fetches it once post-auth, so hydration stays one
  request and one code path — and one `403` keeps the whole page consistent
  instead of half-restoring it.
* **A shared include must stay ungated for its other hosts.** The act-now board is
  rendered by `sector_central.html` too. Its gate is driven by a `pgate` the host
  passes, so a host that passes nothing renders byte-identically. (See the caveat
  below — the *other* host still serves that board anonymously.)
* **Check for a second surface that names the same rows.** Gating the leaders
  strip was almost theatre: the same page carries `#plv-names`, a ticker → company
  name island built from `watch ∪ buy ∪ leaders ∪ laggards`, which re-published by
  name every leader the strip withheld — 77 entries, measured anonymously. A label
  island is display-only and easy to miss precisely because it is not a panel.
  Grep for every emit that carries `name` before calling a desk gated.

**Known caveat (open):** `#action-board` is also rendered on `sector_central.html`,
which is anonymous-public and serves the same ~45 rows ungated. Gating the copy on
`us_stocks.html` removes it from that page's bytes but does not make those rows
unreachable. The Sector Intelligence page needs the same split (its own shell +
payload) for the act-now board to be genuinely gated.

Second application (multi-panel desk):

- `templates/china_special_situations.html.j2`, `templates/_china_special_situations_rows.html.j2`
- `scripts/build_china_special_situations.py` — `_gate_cfg`, `_split`, `_write_premium_payload`
- `tests/test_china_special_situations_gate.py`
- `config/site_access.yml` — note the raw snapshot `/chinaspecialdata/special.json`
  is in `enforced_early.exact` too: gating the page is theatre while the same rows
  stay readable as JSON. Check for that emit whenever you gate a desk.
