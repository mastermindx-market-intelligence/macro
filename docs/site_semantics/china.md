### Market State Score (hero)

- **Shown as:** A 0–100 gauge with a needle; numeric score next to a verdict word: "Risk-on", "Mixed", or "Risk-off". ZH: 市场状态分 with 风险偏好 / 混合 / 避险.
- **Means:** A composite read of the A-share market's current posture — green (risk-on, trend-following supported), yellow (mixed, trade smaller), red (risk-off, defend capital first). It blends trend, volatility, breadth, liquidity, and drawdown-risk legs. It is display-only telemetry and never feeds the scored path.
- **Computed by:** `engine/market_state.py` `market_state_snapshot` via `engine/market_state_cn.py` `CN_PROFILE`. Legs weighted (trend 0.24, risk 0.18, vol 0.16, breadth 0.16, liquidity 0.14, stress 0.12). Raw score renormalized over resolved legs; forced into band by overrides. Score 0–100.
- **So what:** Green = trend-follow and add on strength; yellow = size smaller and watch for resolution; red = defend capital, reduce risk first. This is a present-state read, not a forecast.

---

### Regime Quadrant Pill (hero)

- **Shown as:** A small pill in the hero, e.g. "Goldilocks · early" or "Stagflation · mid". ZH: 金发姑娘 · 早期.
- **Means:** The growth × inflation quadrant the A-share macro backdrop sits in, with a cycle position tag. Q1 Goldilocks = growth up, inflation falling; Q2 Reflation = both up; Q3 Stagflation = growth falling, inflation up; Q4 Growth-scare = both falling. The cycle tag (early/mid/late) places the regime within its current leg.
- **Computed by:** `engine/regime.py` `raw_quad` (growth score ≥0 vs <0, inflation score ≥0 vs <0, both z-scored axes); `apply_hysteresis` requires a new quad to hold `hysteresis_days` consecutive days or a shock-override. Quad names from `QUAD_NAMES`.
- **So what:** Use for which sectors and factors are favoured structurally, not for market timing. Shifts slowly (days to weeks). The market state score beside it is the faster, tape-level read.

---

### 11-Session Path Chart (hero)

- **Shown as:** A line chart showing the market state score over the last 11 trading sessions, right panel of the hero. ZH: 11交易日走势.
- **Means:** Recent trend of the composite market-state score — whether the A-share posture has been improving or deteriorating over the past two weeks.
- **Computed by:** `scripts/build_china.py` `ms_history` key (assembles the last 11 rows from the persisted score_log; the template maps score 0–100 to SVG y-axis 22–190, inverted). Score values produced by `engine/market_state_cn.py` `_cn_risk` and sibling leg functions, fused by `engine/market_state.py` `market_state_snapshot`.
- **So what:** A rising path towards green = a regime improving in real time; a falling path into red = conditions deteriorating. Context only — do not act on a single-session move.

---

### Pullback Risk Radar (hero button / popover)

- **Shown as:** "Pullback risk · [score]" button in the hero, expanding to a popover with a score /100 and per-scare-type bars. ZH: 回撤风险.
- **Means:** A calibrated leading-risk signal measuring the probability of a ≥5% pullback within the next ~21 sessions. Sub-scores measure credit stress, rates shock, bubble unwind, growth scare, volatility event, and global breadth breakdown, then fused. An "elevated" or "risk-off" state fires a loud banner.
- **Computed by:** `engine/risk_radar_intl.py` `snapshot` and `CN_PROFILE` (CN-market profile); wired via `engine/market_state.py` `_radar_override_intl`. Calibrated P(≥5% pullback, 21 sessions) from A-share history: calm ~27%, watch ~32%, caution ~35%, elevated ~40%, risk-off ~50%. Base rate ~30.5% (h21, from CN_PROFILE). These are per-market CN calibration values; the US radar uses different odds.
- **So what:** Elevated/risk-off = take the alert seriously, size down, protect open gains. The signal is loud-and-early by design: it fires before the pullback starts, so some alerts precede moves that don't materialize. Read every alert alongside its stated lift.

---

### What To Do Card (row 1)

- **Shown as:** A card labeled "What To Do" (该怎么做) with a posture dial word (Defensive / Careful / Neutral / Constructive / Aggressive) and bullet reasons.
- **Means:** The playbook-derived trading posture for the current China regime — how aggressive or defensive to be with position sizing and new entries.
- **Computed by:** `scripts/build_china.py` via `engine/china_playbook.py` `build`. Dial label and reasons list stored in the playbook dict under the `dial` key. The playbook reads the regime quad and risk state.
- **So what:** The posture sizes risk, not selections. "Careful" = favour quality entries, keep gross moderate. "Constructive" = lean into setups with regime support. It does not tell you which stocks to buy.

---

### Market Tiles — SSE / CSI300 / ChiNext / Hang Seng (row below hero)

- **Shown as:** Four price tiles showing index level and day change for Shanghai Composite (000001.SS), CSI300 ETF (510300.SS), ChiNext ETF (159915.SZ), and Hang Seng Index.
- **Means:** Glance-tier price tiles for the four major A-share and HK benchmarks, updated each build from the OHLC store.
- **Computed by:** `scripts/build_china.py` `_china_market_tiles` — reads the OHLC store for each symbol; day change and percent are last close vs prior close.
- **So what:** Quick orientation — are the main indexes up or down today? Do not use single-day moves to override the regime or risk-radar read.

---

### Board Track Record Strip — "Beating CSI300 so far" (china_stocks mode, track-record panel)

- **Shown as:** "Beating CSI300 so far: 67% CI 63–70%, Median excess +3.8%, n=660" (ZH: 暂时跑赢沪深300). Also a matured 21d read: "Hit vs CSI300 (21d): XX% CI …".
- **Means:** Of all board picks that have been logged and had a forward return measured so far, this share beat the CSI300 index (510300.SS) on a CSI300-relative, fill-realistic basis. The CI is a Wilson 95% confidence interval on the hit rate. Median excess is the median per-pick CSI300-relative outperformance in percentage points. n is the count of graded picks (unrealized marks included for the "so far" strip; only matured 21d rows for the "21d" strip). This is telemetry for the board ordering, not a win-rate guarantee.
- **Computed by:** `engine/china_standout_track.py` `grade` (matured 21d strip) and `interim_grade` (unrealized "so far" strip). `hit_vs_csi300` and `hit_ci` use `_wilson_ci` (Wilson 95% CI). `median_excess` = median of CSI300-relative excess values. Benchmark = 510300.SS. Entry = T+1 mid-price proxy; `ENTRY_BASIS` and `_MIN_GRADED` control fill and minimum sample size.
- **So what:** A hit rate above 50% with a CI lower bound above 50% means the board ordering has been adding value beyond a random guess vs the index. This is evidence accruing, not a guarantee of future performance. The median excess shows whether the edge is economically meaningful. The n shows how much data is behind the number.

### Sector Rotation Act-Now Board (china.html macro mode, four-lane table)

- **Shown as:** Four-lane table: "Buy Now / In Favour / Bottoming Watch / Reduce & Avoid". Each lane mixes investment themes (scored 0–100 by the basket engine) and sectors (timed by the cycle ladder). ZH: 立即买入 / 看好 / 洗盘观察 / 减仓回避.
- **Means:** Where to look (and where to avoid) in the A-share universe right now. Buy Now = an entry point exists today; In Favour = still good but has run, wait for a dip; Bottoming Watch = first signs of turning up, watch only — never a buy signal; Reduce/Avoid = trend weakening. A name can appear in two lanes simultaneously when trend and timing diverge.
- **Computed by:** `scripts/build_china.py` `assemble_act_now` via `engine/china_act_now.py`. Baskets scored by `engine/baskets_china.py` `compute_china_baskets`; sectors timed by `engine/china_sector_cycles.py` `compute` cycle ladder.
- **So what:** Glance-tier action board. Use Buy Now + In Favour as the starting list for the stock screener. Bottoming Watch is speculative context. Reduce/Avoid means existing positions need a thesis review.

---

### Sector Flow Velocity (internals section)

- **Shown as:** A row of sector tiles with a flow direction chip (e.g. "accelerating in", "decelerating") and a velocity number. ZH: 资金流速度.
- **Means:** How fast capital is flowing into or out of each A-share sector, derived from ETF and composite A-share flow proxies. Acceleration = money is entering the sector faster than last week; deceleration = the inflow is slowing even if the direction is still positive.
- **Computed by:** `scripts/build_china.py` `_internals_vm` via `engine/china_internals.py` `margin_meter` and sibling flow functions. Flow velocity from `engine/china_liquidity.py` `profile`.
- **So what:** Confirms or contradicts the sector rotation read. A Buy Now sector with decelerating inflows may be near a pause. A Bottoming Watch sector with accelerating inflows may be earlier than the price signals suggest.

---

### China Setup Score on Stock Cards (china_stocks mode)

- **Shown as:** "ready 73" chip on each stock card. ZH: 就绪. Score 0–100.
- **Means:** Buy-readiness score: how close this A-share name is to an actionable entry, not a win-rate. Combines the cycle trigger (is the turn happening now?), stored upside (how washed out), distress haircut, and tailwind from sector and theme. A score of 70+ = "primed"; 45–70 = "setting up"; 25–45 = "watch"; below 25 = no setup.
- **Computed by:** `engine/name_score.py` `potential_score`. Blends trigger, fuel, survive, tailwind, confidence, and edge_mult (CN = 1.0 — no validated cross-sectional name edge; reversal edge lives in the cycle/washout trigger). Trigger gate from `_TRIGGER` dict.
- **So what:** A high score means the setup is clean and the timing looks right; it does not mean the stock will go up. Use it to rank the shortlist, not to override the cycle state or the board track record.

## Site Semantics: flow_velocity.html (Flow Observatory V2, W1)

A separate page (`templates/flow_velocity.html.j2`, engine `engine/flow_velocity.py` +
`engine/flow_observatory/{contract,changes}.py`, builder `scripts/build_flow_velocity.py`,
payload `site/flowdata/desk.json` — `schema: "flow_observatory.v2"`, `authority:
"context_only"`). This section documents the W1 trust/change/two-axis additions only; it
does not describe china.html's own internals section above, which is a different page.

### Data Sources — trust strip

- **Shown as:** A row of chips, one per source leg (A-share large-order flow, Southbound
  aggregate, Northbound aggregate, HK southbound holdings, Dragon-Tiger institutional
  seats), each showing its own effective date, coverage, and a state word (current /
  expected T−1 / behind — showing {date} / historical only — ended {date}).
- **Means:** Which underlying feeds this page's numbers rest on, how fresh each one is
  RIGHT NOW, and what kind of data it actually is (an order-size proxy is not "detected
  institutions"). Source state renders BEFORE the market read below it — trust precedes
  claims.
- **Computed by:** `engine/flow_observatory/contract.py` `build_sources` / `leg_ui_state`.
  W1 emits identity, dates, and coverage only; the HEALTHY/DEGRADED/STALE status machine
  lands in a later wave.
- **So what:** A "behind" or "historical only" chip means treat that leg's contribution to
  the page's verdict with extra caution — it is not describing today.

### What Changed Today

- **Shown as:** A list of theme quadrant transitions and rank movers since the previous
  valid market session, or the explicit quiet state "No material flow-state transition
  since the previous valid market session (date)." / first-run state "Change tracking
  begins today — no prior tracked session."
- **Means:** What is actually NEW since the last time this page had a valid reading —
  never re-narrating a session that already printed the same read.
- **Computed by:** `engine/flow_observatory/changes.py` `compute_changes` against
  `data/flow_observatory/state_log.jsonl` (one line per valid CN session, appended only on
  the asia-close/US-nightly lanes — `engine.ledger_lane`).
- **So what:** An empty or quiet read is itself informative (nothing changed) — it is
  distinct from "we have no baseline yet" (first-run), which the page never conflates with
  "nothing changed."

### Pressure vs Actual Flow — the quadrant board

- **Shown as:** A 2×2 board — "real inflow, above norm" / "still selling, pressure easing"
  / "still buying, pace fading" / "real outflow, below norm" — each theme placed by BOTH
  its raw 4-week net flow (abs) and its velocity vs its own trailing norm (rel), shown as
  two separate figures on every chip (e.g. "−0.9% · +2.6σ"), plus two breadth-count lines
  and a per-theme abs/rel/quadrant/rank-Δ column set on the theme flow board below it.
- **Means:** The page's anti-conflation device. A theme can be genuinely still selling
  (negative raw flow) while its selling pressure eases relative to its own norm — the two
  facts are never collapsed into one inflow-colored number. This replaces the old
  "state"/"state_zh" vocabulary (`accelerating in`, `outflow easing`, …), which used
  absolute-sounding words for what was actually a relative (σ) measure.
- **Computed by:** `engine/flow_observatory/contract.py` `quadrant` / `enrich_group` /
  `market_read`, from `abs.value` = `rate_4wk` (themes) or `flow_1m_b` (Southbound
  aggregate) and `rel.value` = `vel`/`vel_primary`. De-minimis neutral bands: |abs| < 0.1pp
  (themes) / < ¥0.5B (Southbound). |rel|: < 0.75σ (themes) / < 0.5σ (names) / < 0.5σ
  (southbound) — themes W5-calibrated, names/southbound at the incumbent default,
  `research/flow_observatory/W5_PREREG.md`,
  `DEC-FLOW-OBSERVATORY-V2-W5-METHOD-SELECTION-R2` (supersedes
  `DEC-FLOW-OBSERVATORY-V2-W5-METHOD-SELECTION`).
- **So what:** Read BOTH figures on a chip before reacting to either one alone — a large σ
  reading with a negative raw flow is not the same market condition as a large σ reading
  with a positive one, even though the old page painted both the same color.

**Descriptive method (W5, 2026-09; revised R2):** the incumbent `slope_z` normalization
(M0) stays for ALL THREE lenses — no evaluated challenger (winsorized / median-MAD /
percentile-probit) cleared the frozen improve-without-worsening bar
(`research/flow_observatory/W5_PREREG.md` §5). Themes' state threshold recalibrates to
0.75σ (tilt band 30pp, was 25pp) — verified sound on its applied surface and reconfirmed
by an independent statistical review. Names and southbound both stay at the incumbent
0.5σ: the first adjudication's names τ=0.3 pick was computed on the harness's
breadth-tilt-style grid and misapplied to the per-name surface, where it breaches the
frozen 25% neutral floor (measured 18.8%) and worsens flip rate (+7.1% relative) — reverted.
The first adjudication's southbound switch to the winsorized variant (M1) rested on a
single unreplicated seeded draw of the frozen §5(a) outlier/quiet metric; independent
30-seed replication found P(pass)≈0.75 under seed variation (median improvement ratio
≈0.57) — seed noise, not a lens property — so the method reverts to M0 as well (its
threshold sweep was already regime-inconclusive: every candidate cutoff's held-out reach
for "above norm" was 0% across the last 60 sessions). Net W5 change: themes thresholds
only. Full arithmetic: `reports/flow_observatory_w5_methods.md` §6 (original) and §7
(revised adjudication); decision records `DEC-FLOW-OBSERVATORY-V2-W5-METHOD-SELECTION-R2`
(supersedes `DEC-FLOW-OBSERVATORY-V2-W5-METHOD-SELECTION`).

### Product-Learning Telemetry (W7)

- **Shown as:** No visible UI — nine typed, fire-and-forget analytics events ride the
  page's existing first-party `/api/collect` beacon (the same one `templates/theme.js`
  already uses for pageview/click/scroll) when a reader hovers, keyboard-focuses, or taps
  a trust-strip chip's LENS tip open, expands the "all changes" overflow, clicks a
  quadrant-cell chip, drills into a group row, opens a 60-session history drawer, runs a
  same-lens compare, scrolls an episodes panel or the watch-limitation note into view, or
  follows a member's Terminal link.
- **Means:** Whether the six live Flow Observatory waves actually change how a reader
  investigates a read — drilldown depth, evidence inspection, and Terminal handoffs —
  rather than a single glanced-at verdict number. `research/flow_observatory/W7_SPEC.md`
  is the frozen event schema: `ev` (one of `trust_open`, `changed_expand`,
  `quadrant_select`, `group_drill`, `history_open`, `compare_run`, `episode_view`,
  `terminal_out`, `watch_note_view`), `lens` (`theme`/`sector`/`aggregate`/null), `id`
  (the group/entity id or null), `sess` (the page's market session string) — nothing
  else. Privacy: group ids, lens names, and — for Terminal handoffs only — the
  instrument symbol the existing `click` event already carries; no holdings, no research
  text, no PII. Deduplicated per `(ev, lens, id)` per pageview (a client-side `Set`);
  `compare_run` in particular dedupes to first-use per pageview — a boolean signal ("did
  this reader ever run a compare"), not a running count of how many compares they ran.
- **Computed by:** A single page-scoped `<script>` block in `templates/flow_velocity.html.j2`
  (event delegation on `data-ev`/`data-ev-lens`/`data-ev-id` attributes already present
  on the relevant DOM nodes, plus the page's own accordion/compare/IntersectionObserver
  hooks). Calls the SAME `window.mmTrack('flowobs', {meta: {...}})` envelope
  `templates/theme.js` already exposes — never a second transport or a new endpoint.
  `app/main.py`'s `/api/collect` whitelist (`_MM_EVENT_TYPES`) accepts the `flowobs`
  wire type; the beacon already passes an arbitrary `meta` object through to
  `analytics_events` (the same idiom `click` events use for `{tag, text, href}`), so no
  new server-side row schema was needed. Registered in `config/growth_events.yml` as
  `flow_observatory.interacted` (funnel stage `intelligence_experienced`).
- **So what:** A near-zero drilldown/evidence-inspection rate on a wave that shipped a
  drilldown means the feature isn't being found or used — not that it doesn't matter.
  Success-metric definitions (time-to-first-drill proxy = pageview → first
  `group_drill`; evidence-inspection share = `trust_open`/`history_open` per pageview;
  Terminal handoff rate = `terminal_out` per pageview; degraded-day engagement = events
  per pageview on `publication_state != HEALTHY` days) are computed server-side later
  from `sess` plus the existing state ledger — nothing new is stored to support them.
  Telemetry never changes flow state, verdicts, or page rendering: the page renders and
  behaves identically whether the beacon loads, is blocked, or throws.
