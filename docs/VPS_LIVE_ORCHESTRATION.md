# VPS live orchestration

## Decision

Use a hybrid ownership model:

| Work | Primary owner | Recovery / reconciliation |
|---|---|---|
| Official publication detection | VPS, ~1 minute | Nightly source/vintage retrieval |
| Display quote snapshot | VPS, ~1 minute | Manual GitHub workflow |
| Live overlay / US risk state | VPS, staggered ~2 minutes | Manual GitHub workflow |
| China risk state | VPS, staggered ~2 minutes in HK window | Manual GitHub workflow |
| Full-universe quotes + US/HK basket pulse | VPS, ~5 minutes | Manual GitHub workflow |
| Intraday bars + flow pulse | VPS, hourly, low priority | Manual GitHub workflow |
| S&P 500 heatmap price splice | VPS, ~10 minutes in US window | Nightly static heatmap |
| Canonical daily source pulls and corrections | Mac/PC nightly | Rerun nightly |
| Regime-pointer stale repair | Mac light runner, once at 14:05 UTC after cutover | Manual dispatch |
| Forward ledgers, grading, calibration, research | Mac/PC nightly | Rerun nightly |
| Full engine and static-site render | Mac/PC nightly | Render workflow |
| Historical/bulk backfills and LLM-heavy jobs | Mac/PC | Explicit operator run |
| BTC/commodity state-transition sentinels (current canonical JSONL writers) | Mac/PC for now | Refactor to VPS sidecar before moving |
| White House/LLM sentinel and qledger registration | Mac/PC for now | Keep its single canonical writer |

One artifact has one scheduled writer. The old Actions workflows retain
`workflow_dispatch`, but their schedules are skipped only when the repository
variable `VPS_LIVE_PRIMARY=true` is set after the VPS soak.

The vector, commodity and White House sentinels are intentionally not lifted
unchanged: today they update canonical event/claim files and sometimes invoke an
LLM. Moving those processes verbatim would create a second ledger writer. Their
future VPS form should emit an ephemeral detection sidecar first; the nightly lane
can fold that sidecar into the canonical event/claim stream exactly once.

## Why the nightly pull stays

The VPS live plane is an ephemeral, fast view. It does not replace the nightly
canonical run because official series are revised, market closes are adjusted,
vendor snapshots can have bad prints, and the forward ledgers must be advanced
exactly once per session. Nightly therefore:

1. re-pulls canonical official/vendor sources;
2. captures revisions and final/adjusted closes;
3. reconciles the live sidecars;
4. advances ledgers and grades forecasts;
5. recomputes the full engine and site.

The first migration reduces live-runner queueing and commit/deploy churn. It does
not intentionally remove the nightly correctness pass. Later, collector-level
telemetry can justify skipping a redundant network fetch, but reconciliation and
ledger advancement still remain.

The old intraday workflow also carried a canonical regime-pointer self-heal.
Because that is not an ephemeral display artifact, it is not moved to the VPS.
After cutover, `regime-self-heal.yml` retains one daily pass on
`macstudio-light`; this replaces dozens of intraday opportunities with one
bounded reconciliation run while preserving single-writer ownership.

## Measured VPS capacity (2026-07-24)

Production was inspected before this design:

- 2 vCPU, 3.8 GiB RAM, about 2.7 GiB available;
- 77 GiB disk, about 38 GiB free;
- load average about 0.41 / 0.27 / 0.23;
- the existing five-minute risk build briefly used roughly 90–95% of both CPUs,
  then returned to idle;
- the risk-state market-driver pass took about nine seconds;
- `/opt/macro` and `/opt/terminal` already consume about 25 GiB combined.

Conclusion: the current 2-vCPU plan can run the live plane if jobs are serialized,
offset and resource-capped. It has low average load but little burst headroom. The
planned 4-vCPU tier is the preferred steady state and should be comfortable for
these short/network-heavy tasks. Bulk backfills, full renders and LLM-heavy work
stay off the VPS regardless of tier.

## Runtime layout

```
/opt/macro                         code + canonical checked-out inputs
/opt/macro/site/live               per-process staging only
/var/lib/macro-live/public/live    atomically published `/live/*` artifacts
/var/lib/macro-live/public/marketdata  live heatmap overlay
/var/lib/macro-live/state          locks, fingerprints, lane status, full quote cache
/var/lib/macro-live/data/intraday  mutable VPS-only hourly bars
```

Caddy serves external files from `/var/lib/macro-live/public` with `no-store`;
the sibling state/data directories are not web-addressable. Existence matchers
fall back to the last `/opt/macro/site.served` copy during installation or an
individual artifact cold start, so merging the route cannot create a live-data 404.
Only the reviewed `/live/quotes.json` snapshot is public. Other `/live/*` files
and the heatmap pass the existing registration and entitlement checks before
Caddy selects an external file; the live plane does not widen the static-access
boundary.
`/marketdata/sp500_heatmap.json` is the one exact legacy path overlaid from the
same live store. Everything else continues to come from `/opt/macro/site.served`.

## Lanes and resource controls

- `macro-live-fast.timer`: every ~60 seconds. Publication watcher runs first.
  Overlay and risk state alternate minutes instead of competing. Resource ceiling:
  180% CPU and 1.5 GiB memory.
- `macro-live-snapshot.timer`: every ~5 minutes. Full quote pull followed by both
  basket pulses on weekdays (the full equity universe does not poll all weekend).
  Lower priority, 90% CPU and 1 GiB memory.
- `macro-live-bars.timer`: hourly at `:37` during 13:00–21:00 UTC weekdays.
  Lowest priority, 90% CPU and 1.25 GiB memory.
- `macro-live-prophet.timer`: every ~5 minutes at `:03/5` during 13:00–21:59 UTC
  weekdays; the pass itself stands down outside 09:25–16:25 America/New_York on the
  Eastern clock (and on NYSE holidays) via `engine/prophet_live/live_states.in_window`,
  so one schedule covers both DST regimes. Lowest priority tier, 60% CPU and 512 MiB
  memory — measured 2026-07-30 at ~0.5 CPU-seconds and ~95 MB peak RSS per pass
  against a production-shaped 1,742-name pack and the real 2,025-symbol quote
  snapshot. It reads `state/quotes_full.json` and `public/live/quotes.json` off disk
  (no network for quotes), publishes the state map and event spool to R2, and writes
  `public/live/prophet_live.json` by atomic rename. That file is **gated**: it is not
  in the reviewed public `/live/*` list, so it passes registration + entitlement
  before Caddy serves it. Requires `R2_*` in `/etc/macro-live.env` and `boto3` in the
  venv; without them the pass reads the public mirror and publishes nothing.
  `.github/workflows/prophet-live.yml` is the self-disabling backstop for this lane.
  Stand-down without touching a unit: set `PROPHET_LIVE_NO_PUBLISH=1` in
  `/etc/macro-live.env` — the timer keeps ticking and nothing is written to R2 or to
  the served copy. `systemctl disable --now macro-live-prophet.timer` is the harder
  stop; note that a later commit which changes either unit file re-arms it.

- `macro-sentinel.timer`: every 30 minutes at `:12/:42`, around the clock, seven
  days a week (`Persistent=true` — a reboot-missed pass fires on boot, because a
  box that was down is exactly when staleness is likely). This is masterplan W1's
  **dead-man switch that lives OUTSIDE GitHub**
  (`research/NIGHTLY_RESILIENCE_AND_LIVE_TRANSITION_MASTERPLAN_2026-08-06.md`
  §0.1): the 2026-08-06 outage froze the boards for six days because every alarm
  lived inside GitHub Actions — the thing that was failing. The pass
  (`scripts/freshness_sentinel.py`, stdlib-only on purpose) fetches the LIVE
  pages' bake stamps (`Last-Modified` of `us_stocks.html`, `china.html`,
  `intelligence_hub.html`), reads the us_stocks board's own delayed-board
  disclosure (`… prices as of YYYY-MM-DD`, rendered by
  `templates/dashboard.html.j2` ONLY when the engine reports the board lags —
  the check that catches a render that keeps re-baking while the boards freeze,
  which is what Jul-31→Aug-6 actually did; a page-wide "as of" scrape cannot
  see it because per-panel annotations stay fresh throughout), reads the China
  board's equivalent disclosure, HEADs the R2
  `massive_stock_day/_manifest.json` publish time, and compares all of it
  against per-surface budgets (26h bakes; 4 calendar days on the US board's
  self-reported lag; 12 days on China to clear Golden Week and Spring Festival).
  A fifth surface, `prophet_us`, catches the same
  re-stamp trap one layer down: the 2026-08-08 audit found
  `data/us_prophet_rank/candidates/2026-08.parquet` frozen at stamp_date
  2026-08-05 while us_stocks.html re-baked fresh daily, so every check above
  stayed green through it (the delayed-board marker reports the PRICE lag, not
  whether the ranker ran). It reads the `source_asof` field of the SERVED
  `prophet/index.json`; that field is specifically copied from
  `us_standouts.staleness.price_through`, the ranked-price watermark, **not**
  the board wrapper's top-level `as_of`. It also requires `source_basis` to be
  exactly `panel_majority` and `source_delayed`, `source_unknown`, and
  `source_mixed_vintage` all to be false. A freshly rebuilt wrapper therefore
  cannot launder a stale, unknown, mixed-vintage, or non-authoritative price
  cross-section. The sentinel reads the artifact off disk from the Caddy static root
  (`/opt/macro/site.served`, override `--served-dir`/`SENTINEL_SERVED_DIR`),
  because that path sits behind the registration wall and an anonymous GET
  answers `HTTP 401` + `x-regwall: deny` — and budgets it at **1 completed NYSE
  session** of lag via `lib/nyse_calendar`, so the second missed session pages.
  The anchor is the exchange calendar, not the wall clock: a weekend or market
  holiday adds zero, which is what lets this budget be far tighter than the page
  budgets without flapping. A missing/unreadable file or a non-JSON body is
  INDETERMINATE (blind), never a breach; well-formed JSON with no `asof` IS a
  breach — a store that cannot vouch for its ranked-price date and source health
  must not read as fresh.
  The nightly publisher is ordered the same way: `build_prophet` generates with
  no R2 credentials, a closed hash-manifest checkpoint must land on `main`, and
  only then may a dedicated step reconstruct `prophet/index.json` from that
  accepted Git commit and upload it. The publisher rechecks the commit and all
  Prophet/correction paths against current `origin/main` immediately before the
  write, then uses an R2 conditional `If-Match`/`If-None-Match` put carrying the
  Git checkpoint and SHA-256 as object metadata. A rejected or superseded
  checkpoint therefore cannot advance R2, and a concurrent R2 writer wins
  instead of being overwritten.
  On breach it alerts the operator —
  Telegram (`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`+`TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`), Discord
  (`DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`), and email via `app.mailer` (`MAIL_SENTINEL_TO` or
  `MAIL_SUPPORT_TO`), any one delivering counts — immediately on first
  detection, then every 6h while the condition persists, with one recovery
  notice when it clears (sent only when every breached surface has read
  definitively fresh — a breached surface that stops answering stays in the
  breach set, so blindness can never masquerade as recovery). Network errors
  are INDETERMINATE, never a breach; six consecutive blind passes (~3h)
  escalate as their own alert. Every pass publishes machine-readable state to
  `public/live/staleness.json` (atomic rename, written AFTER the alert
  transports so a full disk cannot silence the alarm), served publicly at
  `/live/staleness.json` with `no-store` — the input a later wave's on-site
  staleness banner reads; its `ok` is the honest tri-state fold (false on
  active breach OR threshold blindness — "can't tell" never renders as
  "fresh"). Alert transports come from
  `/etc/macro-api.env` (mail) plus the operator slot `/etc/macro-sentinel.env`
  (read last, may override). With no transport configured the pass still
  publishes the state and fails the unit visibly.
  The same unit also runs `scripts.commercial_path_sentinel` first
  (`ExecStart=-`, so its exit cannot skip freshness and a freshness breach
  cannot skip it): GATE-4 money-path alarms (Stripe webhook silence / errors,
  checkout create failures, `require_user` 502 spike, LLM daily spend, brain
  quota fail-open) reuse that transport. Prove locally with
  `python3 -m scripts.commercial_path_sentinel --prove-all`. A missing
  Telegram/Discord/email credential is SKIP, never a papered-over PASS.
  Budgets follow the masterplan
  B5 falsifier law: >2 false-positive pages a month means the budgets are wrong
  — fix the budgets, never mute the sentinel. Acceptance drill (no killing
  anything): `python3 -m scripts.freshness_sentinel --now <now+30h ISO>
  --public-dir /tmp/drill/public --state-dir /tmp/drill/state` — every bake
  surface breaches and the alert path fires end-to-end.

Systemd will not start a second instance of an active oneshot service. The Python
lane locks also coalesce manual/timer overlap. Every browser artifact is JSON
validated and copied through a same-directory temporary file before `replace()`.

## Publication semantics

`scripts.watch_release_publications` polls official Fed, BLS, BEA and DOL endpoints
only inside a small window around a scheduled release. It publishes an ET-aware
event lifecycle (`scheduled`, `watching`, `awaiting_publication`, `published`,
`published_unparsed`, or `verification_delayed`) to
`live/release_publications.json` and preserves source health/fingerprints under
the external state directory.

The FOMC adapter resolves the deterministic official statement URL and extracts
the target range, action, vote and dissent preference without an LLM. Exact-date
official adapters also parse headline/core CPI, PPI, payrolls/unemployment,
GDP, headline/core PCE and initial claims. BLS uses the release-specific Atom
feeds; BEA uses an exact RSS item followed by its permanent release page; DOL
uses the exact dated claims entry in the ETA releases listing because the
per-release URL is a PDF. Every verified packet carries normalized metric IDs,
period, units, bilingual display copy and its official URL.

Ordinary publication sources use a six-hour fast polling window. FOMC uses a
24-hour fast window so a same-evening deploy or overnight process restart still
recovers the official statement. Conditional 304 responses are retried without
validators when a parser-backed event still lacks verified facts, and one shared
BEA RSS response fans out to independent GDP and PCE event IDs.
Every unresolved result family remains in lifecycle/heartbeat output for seven
days and an unparsed receipt is retried every 15 minutes. A parser miss is always
`published_unparsed`, never a green `published` row. It remains unhealthy and
retained until deterministic parsing recovers.

The browser selects Release Radar by date: every selectable event card on that
date shares the active state, and clicking GDP/PCE/claims in succession does not
fake-refresh an unchanged date panel. Simultaneous lifecycle rows render as
independent outcome cards while the hero, next-action card and Radar banner show
aggregate verified/extracting/awaiting counts.

The watcher publishes schedule coverage for every supported family. The external
dead-man fails when that coverage is incomplete, preventing a hard-coded annual
table from silently fabricating or omitting next-year release dates. Official
schedule synchronization is still a planned Phase 1 dependency; the alarm makes
the remaining maintenance requirement explicit and operationally visible.

This sidecar is public because it contains only official agency facts, provenance
and operational lifecycle—not proprietary signals, rankings, portfolios or user
data. Caddy serves it from the external live store with `Cache-Control: no-store`.
The nightly ALFRED/official retrieval remains the sole canonical vintage,
scoreboard and forward-ledger writer.

The public `/api/status` check reports lifecycle counts and publication lag. The
external heartbeat becomes unhealthy when a v2 event remains unverified for more
than two minutes after its scheduled time, when an official publication remains
`published_unparsed`, or when an event falls beyond its type-specific watch
window (six hours normally, 24 hours for FOMC). This prevents a
fresh-but-semantically-empty file from looking operationally healthy.

## Deployment and cutover

1. Merge and let `macro-update` install the new Caddy configuration.
2. On the VPS, run `bash /opt/macro/app/deploy/live-setup.sh`.
3. Add vendor keys to `/etc/macro-live.env` (mode `0600`).
4. Observe `/api/status`, `systemctl list-timers`, and lane journals for at least
   one full US session and one HK session.
5. Confirm `/live/orchestrator_status.json` is current and browser paths are
   served from the external store.
   `python scripts/check_vps_live_health.py` must also pass; after cutover the
   GitHub-hosted `vps-live-heartbeat` workflow runs this dead-man every ten minutes.
6. Set repository variable `VPS_LIVE_PRIMARY=true`.
7. Keep the old workflows available for manual recovery. If the VPS goes stale,
   set the variable false before dispatching or simply use manual dispatch, which
   is always allowed by the workflow guards.

The installer does not remove the legacy VPS cron writer until the fast lane
passes its smoke test and all replacement timers are enabled. To roll back the
VPS itself, run:

```bash
sudo bash /opt/macro/app/deploy/live-rollback.sh
```

The rollback disables the three timers, restores the legacy five-minute cron
entry if needed, and moves the external public tree to a timestamped backup.
Caddy then falls back to the last `site.served` artifacts immediately. Private
state and data are retained for diagnosis. Set `VPS_LIVE_PRIMARY=false` (or delete
the variable) as a separate control-plane step to resume scheduled Actions jobs.

Do not run both scheduled writers after cutover. A dead-man failover may be added,
but it must first check VPS freshness and acquire ownership before writing.
