# Page evidence harness

`scripts/capture_page_evidence.py` — bounded browser evidence capture and UX-smell
census for the pages named in the product page registry.

It is an **evidence tool**. It loads a fixed list of routes anonymously, screenshots
a declared state matrix, and writes down facts a human could count by hand. It
produces no score, no grade, no ranking, and no "this page is bad" label. The
report's own header says it: *heuristics identify review targets; they do not
determine that a page is bad.*

---

## 1. Quick start

```bash
# constants + a canned end-to-end proof; opens no browser, touches no network
python3 scripts/capture_page_evidence.py --self-check

# capture the P0 macro pages from a local build (recommended default)
python3 scripts/capture_page_evidence.py --site-dir site

# capture one route against the live origin
python3 scripts/capture_page_evidence.py \
  --routes /index.html --base-url https://www.mastermind-x.com \
  --viewports desktop --locales en --themes light,dark --max-pages 1

# committed artifacts + a human table
python3 scripts/capture_page_evidence.py --site-dir site \
  --emit-md docs/product_experience/ux_smell_report.md
```

Requires playwright **locally** (not a repo dependency, deliberately):

```bash
python3 -m pip install playwright && python3 -m playwright install chromium
```

### CLI

| flag | default | notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--registry` | `data/product_experience/page_registry.json` | schema `mastermind.page_registry.v1` |
| `--priority` / `--repo` | `P0` / `macro` | registry-row filters |
| `--base-url` \| `--site-dir` | — | exactly one is required |
| `--routes` | — | comma list; overrides registry selection |
| `--output-dir` | `data/product_experience/evidence` | gitignored, local only |
| `--manifest` | `data/product_experience/p0_evidence_manifest.json` | committed |
| `--smells` | `data/product_experience/ux_smell_report.json` | committed |
| `--emit-md` | — | markdown rendering of the smell report |
| `--viewports` / `--locales` / `--themes` | `desktop,tablet,mobile` / `en,zh` / `light,dark` | axes to attempt |
| `--max-pages` | `30` | hard cap; excess rows are recorded as excluded |
| `--delay-ms` | `500` | politeness sleep between page loads |
| `--timeout-s` | `30` | per-navigation timeout |
| `--as-of` | now (UTC) | pins `generated_at`; makes a run byte-reproducible |
| `--observer-config` | built-in | JSON overriding panel selectors, probes, caps |
| `--force-state` | — | repeatable `NAME:TARGET`; one extra shot per cell with a class/attribute forced on `<body>` (see §2) |
| `--headed` / `--self-check` | off | |

Exit codes: `0` captured · `2` usage or registry error · `3` some page captured no
state at all · `4` `verifier_unavailable` (no browser).

### Running without a registry

`--routes` with no registry file on disk synthesizes minimal rows (`page_id` derived
from the route, no declared themes/locales), so every requested axis is attempted.
This is the smoke-test mode. If a registry *does* exist and a `--routes` entry
matches one of its rows, that row is reused — so a registry-declared dark-only page
stays dark-only even when named explicitly.

`--routes` replaces registry selection **entirely**, so `--priority` / `--repo` never
run. The manifest's `selection` block says so rather than echoing the parser
defaults: `mode: "explicit_routes"` with `priority: null`, `repo: null`, and a `note`.
Registry selection records `mode: "registry"` with the filters it actually applied.
(v1 recorded the defaults either way, which is how the committed terminal manifest
came to claim repo `macro` while capturing `app.mastermind-x.com`.)

---

## 2. State matrix

Per page, only where the registry says the axis is supported:

| dimension | values | how it is set |
| --- | --- | --- |
| viewport | desktop 1440×900 · tablet 820×1180 · mobile 390×844 | browser context viewport |
| locale | `en` · `zh` | `data-lang` on `<html>` (see below) |
| theme | `light` · `dark` | `data-theme` on `<html>` (see below) |
| access | **anonymous only** | no session, ever |
| forced state | opt-in, none by default | a class/attribute on `<body>` per `--force-state` (see below) |

A registry row that declares `themes: ["dark"]` produces **no light cell** — the
excluded axis is written into that page's `gaps` with the reason, rather than
attempted and failed. Same for `locales`.

### How the registry narrows a page

| registry field | effect |
| --- | --- |
| `priority` / `repo` | row filters; defaults `P0` / `macro` |
| `route_kind: "page"` | captured at `route` |
| `route_kind: "family"` (e.g. `/dossier/<id>.html`) | **excluded** — a family stands for many URLs and is not itself capturable. Capture one by naming a concrete URL: `--routes /dossier/nvda.html`. A row carrying an `exemplar_route` is captured at that route automatically. |
| `themes` / `locales` as a list | intersected with the requested axes; the difference becomes a gap |
| `themes` / `locales` as `"unknown"` | the registry could not resolve the axis, so it is treated as **silent**: every requested value is attempted and `applied_theme` / `applied_locale` record what the page actually did. An unresolved axis must never read as "supports nothing" — that would expand to zero cells and produce a page with no evidence at all. |

### How locale and theme are applied

Macro pages are same-DOM bilingual: both language spans are always in the markup and
CSS shows one off `html[data-lang]`. The harness therefore applies state exactly the
way the site's own toggle does (`templates/theme.js`):

- `setTheme(tm)` sets `data-theme` on `<html>`, writes `localStorage.theme`, and
  **removes `localStorage.themeAuto`**.
- `setLang(lg)` sets `data-lang`, syncs `document.documentElement.lang`
  (`zh` → `zh-CN`), writes `localStorage.lang`, and fires `langchange`.

Two steps, both load-bearing:

1. **Pre-navigation seed** (`add_init_script`, before any page script runs) writes
   `theme`/`lang` and clears `themeAuto`. Without clearing it, theme.js's boot lift
   re-derives the theme *from the local hour* and silently overrides the attribute —
   the same trap `scripts/light_mode_sweep.py` documents.
2. **Post-load apply** calls the page's own `window.setTheme` / `window.setLang`
   when present, so the widgets that listen for `themechange` / `langchange`
   (gauges, sparklines, Plotly charts) recolour the way they do for a real user.

Whatever `<html>` actually settled on is written back per state as `applied_theme` /
`applied_locale`, and a divergence from what was requested is recorded as a
`state_application` gap.

> **`applied_theme` is the attribute, not a repaint.** Measured on the live landing
> 2026-08-11: `data-theme=dark` applied cleanly while the hero rendered identically
> to light — the hand-authored landing keeps a theme-invariant hero by design. A
> matching `applied_theme` proves the state was accepted, never that the pixels
> changed. Compare the screenshots for that.

### Forced-state capture (`--force-state`)

Migration packets must ship loading / empty / stale / error shots (design-migration
factory §0.4). Against a static build the **data** path cannot be driven — but the
**presentation** usually can, because the estate keys those states off a class or a
data-attribute. `--force-state` toggles that hook and captures an extra shot.

```bash
python3 scripts/capture_page_evidence.py --site-dir site --routes /macro.html \
  --viewports desktop --locales en --themes dark \
  --force-state "empty:.is-empty" \
  --force-state "error:[data-state=error]" \
  --force-state "locked:[data-locked]"
```

`NAME:TARGET`, repeatable. `NAME` is a lowercase slug (it becomes the file-name
suffix; a mixed-case name is lower-cased so one spelling is one file, and the same
name twice is a usage error rather than a silent overwrite). `TARGET` is either a
class (`.is-empty` or `is-empty`) or an attribute selector (`[data-locked]`,
`[data-state=error]`, `[data-state="error"]`). A bare attribute is set to `""`,
which is how a boolean HTML attribute is spelled.

What it does, precisely:

- **Adds cells, never replaces them.** Each viewport/locale/theme yields the page at
  rest **plus** one cell per forced state. With no flag the matrix is exactly what it
  always was.
- **Applies after theme/locale**, through one `classList.add` or `setAttribute` on
  `<body>`, then settles again before the observer and the shot. It never deletes
  nodes or fakes a fetch — that would be the tool synthesizing content, which it
  does not do.
- **Names the state in the file:** `<sha256[:16]>--<name>.png`. Rest shots keep the
  unsuffixed name, so a reviewer can tell the four state shots apart in a directory
  listing without opening the manifest.
- **Discloses a hook that did not take.** The driver reads the class/attribute back
  off the element; if it cannot confirm it, the state row carries
  `applied_force_state: null` and the page gains a `force_state_application` gap.
  The file name never asserts a state nobody saw.
- **Never moves the census numbers.** Metrics (and `screenshot_completion`) are
  measured on the rest cells only — a forced-empty page would otherwise drag
  `visible_word_count` and `section_count` away from what the page renders. Forced
  shots are evidence, not measurements.

**What it is not.** A forced shot shows that state's *styling*, not data the page
returned. Where a fixture payload exists, the fixture is the stronger evidence. The
manifest says this in three places rather than letting the file name imply more than
happened: the `honesty.force_states` line, the state row's `applied_force_state`, and
the page-state gap row — which **stays in the ledger** and flips to
`captured: true` with the forcing named:

```json
{"dimension": "page_state", "value": "empty", "captured": true,
 "reason": "captured by forced presentation; the page's own data path was not
            exercised, ... (--force-state empty:.is-empty)"}
```

A forced name that is not one of the four synthesizable states (`hover`, `locked`, …)
invents no `page_state` row — it is simply an extra shot.

---

## 3. Honesty rules

These are the point of the tool, not decoration.

1. **Anonymous only.** No credential is entered, stored, synthesized, or read. Free
   / Essential / Pro are recorded on every page as gaps:
   `{"dimension": "access", "value": "pro", "captured": false, "reason": "requires
   authenticated session; not automatable without approved fixtures"}`.
   A tier state will only ever be captured through approved fixtures, and until
   those exist the manifest says so out loud.
2. **Premium payload cannot leak.** Because every load is anonymous, the artifacts
   contain only what a logged-out visitor is served. Nothing gated can enter a
   screenshot, a metric, or the manifest by construction — not by policy.
3. **Loading / empty / stale / error are gaps by default**, reason `"state not
   synthesizable against static output"`. Faking them against a static build would
   produce a screenshot of a state the product never shows. `--force-state` (§2) is
   the one sanctioned exception and is not an escape from this rule: it toggles the
   page's own presentation hook, keeps the gap row in the ledger, and labels the
   result a forced presentation whose data path never ran. A state nobody asked to
   force stays a gap with the reason above.
4. **A missing capture is written down, never omitted.** A 404, a timeout, or a
   driver error is `captured: false` with the error text; the run continues. A page
   that captured nothing still carries every metric key, all null, and
   `screenshot_completion: 0.0` — a page can be blind, but it cannot be silently
   absent.
5. **No browser is never a pass.** Missing playwright or chromium exits `4` with
   outcome `verifier_unavailable`, prints the install command, and **writes no
   artifact** — a no-browser run must never overwrite committed evidence with an
   empty one.
6. **No judgment vocabulary.** No metric is named score/grade/rating/rank/severity,
   nothing is weighted or combined, and the smell report carries no verdict column.
   Both the JSON and the markdown lead with the disclaimer.
7. **Every heuristic publishes its own false-positive risk** in `metric_notes`,
   which travels inside the committed report.
8. **An error names its source.** Every console error is
   `{"text": ..., "source_url": ...}` and every 4xx/5xx response the page took is
   listed in the page's `failed_responses` as `{"url": ..., "status": ...}`. The
   2026-08 census found a bare `"401"` on 12 of 13 P0 pages and could not say
   which request produced it — an unattributable finding is a dead end for whoever
   has to fix it. `source_url` is null only where the driver genuinely has none
   (an uncaught `pageerror` has no location); a URL is never guessed.
9. **Evidence outlives the load.** A page that 401s and then times out settling —
   the exact class this feature exists for — still publishes its console errors and
   failed responses. The driver carries both out of a failed observation (including
   a top-level 4xx/5xx and a `goto` that raised), and the run harvests them from
   *every* observation before any state is skipped. The states are still
   `captured: false` with the error text; nothing here fakes a capture.
10. **Provenance is named, never asserted.** `resolved_sha_source` states which git
    directory answered and what that does *not* prove — see §5.
11. **The `selection` block records what actually selected the pages**, never the
    parser defaults for a filter that did not run (see `--routes` above).

---

## 4. What is measured

One injected observer script per page load returns one JSON blob; the driver adds
console and network counts. `innerText` is layout-aware, so the hidden half of the
bilingual DOM is excluded automatically for the locale that is not showing.

| metric | definition | caveat |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `document_height_px` | `documentElement.scrollHeight` at that viewport | |
| `section_count` | direct `<section>` children of `<body>` + direct element children of `<main>` | approximation of "how many blocks" |
| `heading_counts` | visible `h1`–`h6` counts | |
| `duplicate_heading_texts` | case-folded visible heading text seen more than once | repeated tab labels are legitimate |
| `panel_count` | visible matches of `.card,.panel,[class*='card']` (configurable) | class-name heuristic; over- and under-counts expected |
| `visible_word_count` | whitespace-split `body.innerText` | Chinese is not word-segmented — a zh capture reads lower than en for identical copy (measured: landing 1,886 en vs 1,201 zh) |
| `long_paragraph_count` | visible `<p>` over 120 words (configurable) | |
| `raw_slug_hits` / `_count` | visible text matching `\b[a-z][a-z0-9]+(_[a-z0-9]+){2,}\b` | 3+ segment snake_case; deliberately quoted identifiers and file names match too |
| `todo_placeholder_hits` / `_count` | `TODO\|FIXME\|PLACEHOLDER\|lorem ipsum`, case-insensitive, visible | |
| `horizontal_overflow` | `scrollWidth > clientWidth` | |
| `elements_wider_than_viewport` | visible elements wider than the viewport (+1px tolerance) | |
| `console_error_count` | distinct console `error` **texts** across every **attempted** state, captured or not | one text emitted by two assets is two entries in `console_errors` but still one text here |
| `request_count` / `payload_bytes_total` | driver request/response listeners, reference state | bytes exclude responses the driver cannot size |
| `asof_present` / `source_present` | selector **or** case-insensitive text probe (`[data-asof]`, `.asof`, `.freshness`; "as of", "数据截至") | approximate contract probe; absence is a prompt to look, not a verdict |
| `screenshot_completion` | captured states / attempted states | registry-excluded axes are not attempted |

Two per-page lists sit beside the metrics rather than inside them, because neither
is a count: `console_errors` (`{"text", "source_url"}`, deduped on the pair, first-seen
order) and `failed_responses` (`{"url", "status"}`, deduped on the pair). Both
aggregate across every state the driver **attempted**, captured or not — a state
that failed to load is often the one carrying the evidence.

Scalar metrics come from the **reference state** — the first captured cell in matrix
order, named in `metrics.measured_in`. One page load is one measurement; a blend of
six would describe no state that exists. Viewport-sensitive metrics additionally
appear per viewport under `metrics.by_viewport`.

Lists are capped at 25 distinct samples so a committed artifact stays bounded.

---

## 5. Outputs

| path | committed? | contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `data/product_experience/evidence/<sha256[:16]>.png` | **no** (gitignored) | content-addressed full-page screenshots; identical bytes collapse onto one file |
| `data/product_experience/p0_evidence_manifest.json` | yes | schema `mastermind.p0_evidence.v2` — target, axes, selection, per-page states (with each shot's full sha256, byte size, and pixel dimensions), metrics, attributed console errors, failed responses, gaps |
| `data/product_experience/ux_smell_report.json` | yes | schema `mastermind.ux_smell_report.v1` — per-page metrics, metric notes, disclaimer, zero interpretation |
| `--emit-md` target | your choice | the same report as a table sorted by route |

The screenshots are gitignored on purpose: a full P0 sweep is ~360 PNGs at ~0.5 MB,
they are re-derivable, and the manifest's digests keep them citable without the
bytes entering Git. **Cite a screenshot by its sha256**, and re-run the capture to
regenerate it.

### Provenance: what the sha is, and what it is not

`target.resolved_sha_or_none` carries a git HEAD in `--site-dir` mode and is `null`
for `--base-url`: a live origin does not disclose the commit it is serving, and
guessing would be a fabricated provenance claim. It is read out of `.git` **by
hand** — walk up for `.git`, follow a linked worktree's `gitdir:` pointer and
`commondir`, resolve the ref from the **common dir** (only `HEAD`, `refs/bisect/*`,
`refs/worktree/*` and `refs/rewritten/*` are per-worktree) or fall back to
`packed-refs` — not by shelling out to `git rev-parse`, for the CI-scope reason in
§7. The sha is normalized to lowercase; anything unparseable is `null`.

**The walk is unbounded, exactly like git's, so it finds the *nearest* git
directory at or above `--site-dir` — which is not proof that that checkout produced
the files being served.** A `--site-dir` outside any real checkout will land on
whatever repository sits above it (on a dev Mac, `/Users/<user>` is often itself a
repo). The manifest therefore prints `target.resolved_gitdir_or_none` — the git
directory that actually answered — and `resolved_sha_source` names it and says what
it does not prove. Read the pair, not the sha alone. The earlier text, "git HEAD of
the checkout that produced `--site-dir`", asserted a relationship nothing checked.

`p0_evidence_manifest.v1 → v2`: `console_errors` entries went from bare strings to
`{"text", "source_url"}`, and pages gained `failed_responses`. Any reader of a v1
artifact must be re-pointed rather than fed a v2 one. `tool.version` moved `1.0.0
→ 1.1.0` in the same step: it is stamped into every artifact as provenance, so two
byte-different manifest shapes must never claim one version. `1.1.0 → 1.2.0` is
that rule again — the schema stays `v2` (`target` gained a key, additively, so a v2
reader still parses), but the emitted bytes moved, so the version moved with them.

Runs are deterministic — same registry, same driver, same `--as-of` produces
byte-identical JSON, so a re-run diffs cleanly.

---

## 6. Politeness — this is a census, not a crawler

- **No link following, ever.** Only registry routes (or explicit `--routes`) are
  requested. There is no queue, no frontier, no discovery.
- **Sequential**, one page load at a time, `--delay-ms` (default 500 ms) between
  loads.
- **Hard `--max-pages` cap** (default 30); rows beyond it are recorded as excluded
  rather than quietly captured.
- **Identified UA:** `mastermind-page-census/1.0 (internal product observability)`.
- **A dead route is not hammered.** One load failure on a page marks the remaining
  states of that page not-attempted with the load error, instead of retrying the
  same broken URL for every remaining cell.
- Prefer `--site-dir` (a local build served on an ephemeral loopback port, the
  `scripts/light_mode_sweep.py` pattern) over `--base-url`. The live origin is for
  spot checks.

---

## 7. CI stance

**This tool is never wired into CI or the nightly.** Render budget is law here
(~67 min, 4-core-bound); a browser sweep belongs off the render path, run locally
during product-experience work — the same stance as `scripts/light_mode_sweep.py`.

`tests/test_capture_page_evidence.py` is CI-safe and hermetic: it opens no browser,
no socket, and no file outside `tmp_path`. The driver is an injected in-memory
`FakeDriver` through the same `PageDriver` seam production uses.

> `pytest.importorskip("playwright")` is deliberately **absent**. CI installs
> minimal deps and playwright is not a repo dependency, so an importorskip would
> SKIP green forever and prove nothing. Two tests pin the boundary: an AST check
> that `playwright` is imported only inside `playwright_page_driver`, and a
> subprocess run of `--self-check` asserting `playwright` never enters
> `sys.modules`.

### The suite's owner job, and why the module has no subprocess

The manifest job is `product-experience-capture` in `.github/ci/legacy-jobs.yml`
(the registry census runs as its own `product-experience-registry` job). The split
is load-bearing: `scripts/run_ci_pack.py` derives each job's scope from the *union*
of its commands' read closures, and the registry builder is honestly broad — it
censuses the real `site/` and `templates/` trees. Unioned with the capture suite,
that breadth became the capture suite's too.

`scripts/capture_page_evidence.py` therefore contains **no subprocess call and no
filesystem-enumeration call** (`glob` / `rglob` / `iterdir` / `listdir` / `walk` /
`scandir`). `scripts/ci_scope_dependencies.py` treats both as opaque edges and
widens the owning job to every scan root the module's string literals name — for
this module `data/**`, which then matches data-only diffs that cannot touch it. The
measured cost when it did: the representative narrow-diff contract in
`tests/test_ci_pack.py` selected 145 of 181 jobs against a cap of 144, and
`ci-pack-9` went red. Hence `_git_head_sha` reads `.git` by hand and `self_check`
verifies the files `run_capture` reports having written (`written_pngs`, a run
receipt kept out of the manifest so the byte-comparison stays honest) instead of
globbing the output directory. Reading a known path is fine; *discovering* one is
the opaque edge. `test_the_module_carries_no_subprocess_or_enumeration_edge` fails
the moment either comes back.

**What the write receipt trades away.** The receipt is filled by the same loop that
fills each state's `sha256`, so comparing the two is a tautology on its own — the
per-state **re-hash** (read the file the manifest names, re-digest it, compare) is
what makes it a check, and on digest correctness it is stronger than the name-only
`glob("*.png")` comparison it replaced. It is *weaker* in one direction: a ledger
can only see files the manifest names, so a stray or half-written PNG that no state
references is invisible to it, where the glob would have noticed. That is
acceptable only because `self_check` runs entirely inside a fresh
`TemporaryDirectory` nothing else writes to — it is not a general filesystem audit,
and it must not be described as one.

**The self-check must be able to fail.** Every manifest assertion in `self_check`
is a set comparison or an `all(...)`, and all of them pass vacuously over an empty
run: with a driver that captured nothing, `--self-check` once exited `0` with
`findings: []` and zero screenshots written. It now asserts the run did its job
first — `outcome: captured`, `states_captured > 0`, `states_captured ==
states_attempted` (the canned driver captures every cell), at least one captured
state per page, and at least one console error and one failed response surviving
into the manifest, which is what makes the attribution-shape checks non-vacuous and
covers the failed-load evidence path. Two tests monkeypatch `_SelfCheckDriver` to
capture nothing and pin that the result is `ok: false`.

Run it with `TZ=UTC python3 -m pytest tests/test_capture_page_evidence.py -q`
(CI runs UTC; the suite is TZ-agnostic because every fixture pins `--as-of`).
