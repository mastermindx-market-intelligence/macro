# Stock Identity W3 Measurement Release Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Deliver the first post-W2 Stock Identity measurement release: an executable expert-independent localization ruler, honest estimability/dependence census, and a terminated-instrument survivorship control status, with zero confirmatory fit/routing authority.

**Architecture:** Extend the existing `engine/stock_identity/` package rather than creating a second research framework. W3A creates deterministic ruler primitives over W1 episodes + W2 events; W3B computes support/estimability from those same canonical objects; W3S reuses current data owners to supply a bounded terminated-instrument control cohort or returns a typed hard blocker. No task opens Q1 outcomes, changes Prophet, writes Radar, or modifies sealed W1 partitions.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3, pandas/numpy/scipy where already present, parquet/json artifacts, existing `engine/trial_ledger.py`, existing Agent OS/CI patterns, pytest.

**Spec:** `research/stock_identity/STOCK_IDENTITY_COMPLETE_MASTERPLAN_2026-08-28.md` and `research/stock_identity/W3_FINAL_ARCHITECTURE_FREEZE_2026-08-27.md` on operation carrier Macro PR #6529.

## Global Constraints

- `DNR:KILL-OUTCOME-AUDITION` remains total; no per-name best expert/rank output exists in W3.
- Only existing W1 episodes/fingerprints/partitions and W2 historical expert events/attribution may feed W3A/W3B — plus exactly one Sol-authorized exception: the Task 3C calibration-fire substrate (same W2 replay machinery over the drawn `SI-SEALED-CAL-P1` roster only, calibration-purpose-only, authority-false, closed law in Task 3C and freeze §4.1). The substrate cannot feed Q1/W5 population definition, expert ranking, W3B estimability inclusion, Prophet, or any fit table.
- W3A must remain expert-independent on the episode-definition side; `engine/stock_identity/episodes.py` may not import expert producers/replay modules.
- Frozen graded composite family is exactly `C-LOC-R` and `C-LOC-D`; any other composite is exploratory and must not enter W5 inputs.
- Honest N is distinct episodes plus distinct calendar clusters/blocks; raw fires/rows are never the headline N.
- Every output uses all-false Stock Identity authority from `engine/stock_identity/authority.py`.
- W3S must reuse current canonical adjusted-history owners first; it may not create a general second market-data plane.
- `data/massive_stock_day` remains prohibited for behavioral math.
- Sealed W1 calibration/blind manifests and W1-A1 GOLD/Barrick receipts remain byte/logically unchanged.
- No `engine/entry_signal.py`, `engine/signal_gate.py`, `engine/confluence_tiers.py`, `engine/signal_quality.py`, `engine/prophet_*.py`, `engine/stock_personality.py`, `engine/oracle/personality_context.py`, `scripts/build_stock_library.py`, or `engine/entry_radar/**` modification in W3.
- Channel A carries the original §2.3 capacity budget, exact per training fold: effective parameter count `p_eff` is declared before any fit and must satisfy `p_eff <= floor(N_train_names / 10)` where `N_train_names` is that fold's post-exclusion training name count; the functional form is additive/monotone in a declared feature subset unless a richer form is separately preregistered. W3 freezes this model constitution (Task 3B); no W3 task fits the map or opens Q1.
- The PR-3 ruler-composite constant family (`lambda_fs`, recall floor, declared composite constants) is NOT already frozen. It is set exactly once in Task 3C from `SI-SEALED-CAL-P1` under rule-before-value discipline (selection rule declared in code/doc BEFORE any value is computed from partition data), with exemplars and the untouched blind arm contributing nothing, declared ±20% diagnostic grids registered in the TrialLedger before execution, and the later fit-read look budget logged. Task ordering is binding: the constant-setting act runs only after the metric/composite primitives (Tasks 2-3) and the calibration replay manifest/hashes are committed.
- W3 completion is a measurement release, not Q1, SIF, Prophet integration, or production trading authority.

### Task 1: Freeze the W3 ruler wire contract and failing fixtures

**Files:**
- Create: `engine/stock_identity/ruler.py`
- Create: `tests/test_stock_identity_ruler.py`
- Create: `data/stock_identity/ruler/ruler_spec_v1.json`
- Create: `research/stock_identity/W3_RULER_REGISTRATION.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces:
  - `RulerSpec.from_json(path: Path) -> RulerSpec`
  - `RulerSpec.spec_hash() -> str`
  - `validate_ruler_inputs(events: pd.DataFrame, attribution: pd.DataFrame, episodes: pd.DataFrame) -> None`
  - closed per-fire/per-cell metric column names (owned by `compute_fire_metrics` and its aggregations): `lead_lag`, `price_dist`, `atr_dist`, `mae_after`, `capture`, `false_start` (per-fire flag), `false_start_rate` (aggregate consumed by the composites), `flooding`, `recall_at_tier`, `zone_precision`, `relative_order`, `consistency`
  - closed unconditional-block column names (owned by `compute_unconditional_block`): `fires_per_name_year`, `episode_attribution_rate`
  - closed composite names: `c_loc_r`, `c_loc_d`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing contract tests**

```python
from pathlib import Path
from engine.stock_identity.ruler import RulerSpec


def test_ruler_spec_has_only_two_graded_composites():
    spec = RulerSpec.from_json(Path("data/stock_identity/ruler/ruler_spec_v1.json"))
    assert spec.graded_composites == ("c_loc_r", "c_loc_d")


def test_ruler_spec_hash_is_stable():
    spec = RulerSpec.from_json(Path("data/stock_identity/ruler/ruler_spec_v1.json"))
    assert len(spec.spec_hash()) == 64
    assert spec.spec_hash() == RulerSpec.from_json(Path("data/stock_identity/ruler/ruler_spec_v1.json")).spec_hash()
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the tests and prove red**

Run:

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_stock_identity_ruler.py::test_ruler_spec_has_only_two_graded_composites tests/test_stock_identity_ruler.py::test_ruler_spec_hash_is_stable -q
```

Expected: import/file failure because `ruler.py` / `ruler_spec_v1.json` do not exist.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add the minimal typed ruler spec**

Implement `RulerSpec` as an immutable dataclass containing only receipted constants: the previously frozen W1 geometry constants (attribution pre-window, useful-zone session/ATR bounds, false-start ATR threshold, ATR basis, grain labels, episode-type anchor mapping) plus the PR-3 ruler-composite family (`recall floor`, `lambda_fs`, any declared composite constants), which does not exist yet and is written exactly once by Task 3C. Until Task 3C runs, the PR-3 fields carry the explicit sentinel `{"status": "pending_sealed_calibration"}` — never a guessed number.

Synthetic-fixture testing bridge (per the freeze's ordering law — "metric/composite primitives are frozen and tested on synthetic fixtures first"): Tasks 2-3 test the metric/composite MATH by constructing a `RulerSpec` directly in test code with clearly-labeled FIXTURE-ONLY constants (e.g. `lambda_fs=0.5`). Fixture constants are never serialized to `ruler_spec_v1.json`, never readable by any script path, and are not receipts; a test asserts the shipped JSON still carries the pending sentinel while fixture tests pass. Production PR-3 values exist only after Task 3C.

Canonical hash implementation:

```python
def spec_hash(self) -> str:
    payload = json.dumps(self.to_canonical_dict(), sort_keys=True, separators=(",", ":")).encode()
    return hashlib.sha256(payload).hexdigest()
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Encode the frozen JSON spec and registration receipt**

`ruler_spec_v1.json` must contain explicit numeric constants sourced only from the Task 3C one-time sealed-calibration receipt or previously frozen W1 constants (with the pending sentinel for PR-3 fields before Task 3C), plus `authority` all false and `graded_composites: ["c_loc_r", "c_loc_d"]`. `W3_RULER_REGISTRATION.md` records the source/hash of every constant and states that the blind arm was not opened.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the contract tests**

Run:

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_stock_identity_ruler.py -q
```

Expected: contract tests pass; later metric tests may still be absent.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit Task 1**

```bash
git add engine/stock_identity/ruler.py tests/test_stock_identity_ruler.py data/stock_identity/ruler/ruler_spec_v1.json research/stock_identity/W3_RULER_REGISTRATION.md
git commit -m "stock-identity W3A: freeze localization ruler contract"
```

### Task 2: Implement deterministic per-fire/per-episode metrics and unconditional block

**Files:**
- Modify: `engine/stock_identity/ruler.py`
- Modify: `tests/test_stock_identity_ruler.py`
- Create: `scripts/stock_identity_build_ruler.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: W1 episode rows, W2 event rows, W2 attribution rows, accepted daily adjusted bars.
- Produces:

```python
def compute_fire_metrics(
    events: pd.DataFrame,
    attribution: pd.DataFrame,
    episodes: pd.DataFrame,
    bars_by_symbol: Mapping[str, pd.DataFrame],
    spec: RulerSpec,
) -> pd.DataFrame: ...


def compute_unconditional_block(
    events: pd.DataFrame,
    attribution: pd.DataFrame,
    episode_rows: pd.DataFrame,
) -> pd.DataFrame: ...
```

- [ ] **Step 1: Add failing synthetic metric tests**

Create a three-episode fixture covering reset, reclaim and censored/unresolved cases plus events before/inside/outside attribution windows. Assert exact sign convention (`lead_lag < 0` anticipates), censored episodes have no anchor metrics, and out-of-episode fires remain in `fires_per_name_year` / attribution-rate denominators.

Example:

```python
def test_censored_episode_has_no_anchor_metrics_but_counts_unconditional():
    out = compute_fire_metrics(events, attribution, episodes, bars, spec)
    row = out.loc[out["episode_id"] == "E_CENSORED"].iloc[0]
    assert pd.isna(row["lead_lag"])
    assert pd.isna(row["atr_dist"])
    unconditional = compute_unconditional_block(events, attribution, episodes)
    assert unconditional.loc[unconditional["ticker"] == "AAA", "fires_per_name_year"].iloc[0] > 0
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run red**

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_stock_identity_ruler.py -k "lead_lag or censored or unconditional" -q
```

Expected: missing functions/columns.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement metrics with no ranking step**

`compute_fire_metrics` returns one measurement row per valid event↔episode attribution, never one best-expert row. Episode anchor selection is a pure mapping from episode type. All bars are prior-close ATR-based as already frozen; no future data enters event `known_ts`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement unconditional false-positive accounting**

Every expert/ticker row must include total fires, attributed fires, `fires_per_name_year`, and `episode_attribution_rate = attributed_fires / total_fires`, preserving zero-total as explicit no-coverage rather than division to zero.

- [ ] **Step 5: Add no-ranking/no-authority mutation guards**

Tests scan W3 output schema and `engine/stock_identity/ruler.py` for prohibited output columns such as `best_expert`, `expert_rank`, `winner`, `route`, `prophet_score`, and verify all serialized authority axes remain false.

- [ ] **Step 6: Run targeted tests**

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_stock_identity_ruler.py -q
```

Expected: pass.

- [ ] **Step 7: Run real pilot smoke without blind output**

```bash
python3 scripts/stock_identity_build_ruler.py --pilot --output-dir /tmp/si-w3a-ruler-smoke
```

Expected: metric/unconditional artifacts for the design-touched pilot only, explicit censored counts, no blind-name table, no `best`/`rank` output. The script additionally emits `support_coverage_v1.parquet` — the outcome-independent support/coverage frame for W3B (identifiers, clocks/blocks, family/grain, attribution presence, feature/price coverage, censored/availability state; NO realized metric or composite columns) — which is the ONLY ruler-side artifact Task 4 may consume.

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit Task 2**

```bash
git add engine/stock_identity/ruler.py tests/test_stock_identity_ruler.py scripts/stock_identity_build_ruler.py
git commit -m "stock-identity W3A: implement episode localization metrics"
```

### Task 3: Implement the two composites, grain controls, and mandatory null generators

**Files:**
- Modify: `engine/stock_identity/ruler.py`
- Modify: `tests/test_stock_identity_ruler.py`
- Create: `engine/stock_identity/ruler_nulls.py`
- Create: `tests/test_stock_identity_ruler_nulls.py`

**Interfaces:**

```python
def compute_composites(metrics: pd.DataFrame, spec: RulerSpec) -> pd.DataFrame: ...

def random_fire_null(events: pd.DataFrame, episodes: pd.DataFrame, seed: int, spec: RulerSpec) -> pd.DataFrame: ...

def grain_cadence_null(events: pd.DataFrame, episodes: pd.DataFrame, spec: RulerSpec) -> pd.DataFrame: ...

def equal_proximity_control(metrics: pd.DataFrame, tolerance_atr: float) -> pd.DataFrame: ...
```

- [ ] **Step 1: Add failing composite identity tests**

```python
def test_c_loc_r_exact_formula():
    row = pd.DataFrame([{"recall_at_tier": 0.5, "zone_precision": 0.8, "false_start_rate": 0.1}])
    out = compute_composites(row, spec)
    assert out.loc[0, "c_loc_r"] == pytest.approx(0.5 * 0.8 - spec.lambda_fs * 0.1)
```

Also assert `c_loc_d` refuses rows below the recall floor. (`spec` in these tests is the fixture-only test spec per Task 1's synthetic-fixture bridge — production constants do not exist until Task 3C.)

- [ ] **Step 2: Add failing null invariance tests**

Assert random null preserves per-expert fire count and declared dwell structure; grain null preserves each expert's cadence/stamp lag; equal-proximity control never pairs observations outside the ATR tolerance.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run red**

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_stock_identity_ruler.py tests/test_stock_identity_ruler_nulls.py -q
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement composites and null generators**

No function may inspect per-name outcome rank to select a parameter, expert or neighborhood. Seeds are deterministic and recorded into the W3 registration artifact.

- [ ] **Step 5: Add TrialLedger discipline**

Any diagnostic sensitivity grid invoked by the W3 script must register the exact grid before execution via the existing `engine/trial_ledger.py` contract. The shipped-parameter primary path itself is not a grid search.

- [ ] **Step 6: Run all W3A tests and real pilot smoke**

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_stock_identity_ruler.py tests/test_stock_identity_ruler_nulls.py -q
python3 scripts/stock_identity_build_ruler.py --pilot --include-nulls --output-dir /tmp/si-w3a-ruler-smoke
```

Expected: tests pass (composite math proven on fixture-only constants); metric/unconditional artifacts and all nulls present in the real smoke; the build script REFUSES to compute composites while the spec's PR-3 fields carry the pending sentinel (it must never substitute a fixture value) and emits an explicit `composites_pending_sealed_calibration` marker instead; no blind/fit/rank output. The "both graded composites present" acceptance moves to Task 3C.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit Task 3**

```bash
git add engine/stock_identity/ruler.py engine/stock_identity/ruler_nulls.py tests/test_stock_identity_ruler.py tests/test_stock_identity_ruler_nulls.py scripts/stock_identity_build_ruler.py
git commit -m "stock-identity W3A: add composites and localization nulls"
```

---

### Task 3B: Freeze the Channel-A model constitution (prereg only — no fitting)

**Files:**
- Create: `research/stock_identity/W3_CHANNEL_A_MODEL_CONSTITUTION.md`
- Create: `data/stock_identity/ruler/channel_a_constitution_v1.json`
- Create: `engine/stock_identity/model_constitution.py`
- Create: `tests/test_stock_identity_model_constitution.py`

**Interfaces:**

```python
def load_constitution(path: Path) -> "ChannelAConstitution": ...
def count_p_eff(constitution: "ChannelAConstitution") -> int: ...
def assert_capacity(p_eff: int, n_train_names: int) -> None:  # raises CapacityViolation when p_eff > n_train_names // 10 (exact floor law)
    ...
```

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing constitution tests**

Assert: the JSON declares an explicit feature subset that is a subset of the actual W1 fingerprint columns; the functional form is `additive_monotone` (a richer form is admissible only via a `separately_preregistered_form_ref` field pointing at a real registration document — absent here); `count_p_eff` implements the exact declared counting rule deterministically; `assert_capacity` raises on `p_eff > n_train_names // 10` and passes exactly at the boundary; the module imports no fitting/estimation library and no fit entry point exists.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run red**

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_stock_identity_model_constitution.py -q
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Author the constitution artifact**

`W3_CHANNEL_A_MODEL_CONSTITUTION.md` freezes, per original masterplan §2.3 control (i): the declared fingerprint feature subset (named columns), the allowed additive/monotone functional form, the exact `p_eff` counting rule (formula stated, including per-feature shape terms), `p_eff <= floor(N_train_names / 10)` exact per training fold, with `N_train_names` defined as that fold's post-exclusion training name count, and the enforcement contract: W5Q evaluates `assert_capacity` on every training fold BEFORE any fit and a violation aborts the read. The JSON mirror is spec-hashed; authority all false. W3 fits nothing.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run green and commit Task 3B**

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_stock_identity_model_constitution.py -q
git add research/stock_identity/W3_CHANNEL_A_MODEL_CONSTITUTION.md data/stock_identity/ruler/channel_a_constitution_v1.json engine/stock_identity/model_constitution.py tests/test_stock_identity_model_constitution.py
git commit -m "stock-identity W3A: freeze Channel-A model constitution (capacity budget)"
```

### Task 3C: Calibration-fire substrate + one-time constant-setting for the PR-3 ruler family (Sol ruling 2026-08-28)

Runs ONLY after Tasks 2 and 3 (metric/composite primitives frozen and synthetic-fixture-tested). This task executes the bounded calibration-fire substrate act and then the one-time sealed-calibration constant-setting. Production `lambda_fs`/`recall_floor` values may not be computed before the metric implementation, rule text, and replay/family/spec hashes are committed.

**Files:**
- Create: `scripts/stock_identity_calibration_replay.py`
- Create: `scripts/stock_identity_calibrate_w3.py`
- Create: `tests/test_stock_identity_w3_calibration.py`
- Create: `data/stock_identity/ruler/calibration_replay_manifest_v1.json`
- Modify: `data/stock_identity/ruler/ruler_spec_v1.json`
- Modify: `research/stock_identity/W3_RULER_REGISTRATION.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces the calibration-fire substrate (calibration-purpose-only, authority-false) and the one-time PR-3 constant receipt: `recall_floor`, `lambda_fs`, and any declared composite constants, each with its written selection rule, rule hash, roster hash, replay/family/spec hashes, and computed value.

**Closed substrate law (encode as tests, not prose):**
- Reuse the SAME W2 replay machinery and the registered W2 family registry/spec hashes. No second replay framework, no new expert family, no Class-P backfill, no new producer semantics, no parameter sweep, no fit/rank output.
- Input roster is the drawn-name component of `SI-SEALED-CAL-P1` only, taken mechanically from the frozen partition manifest (`data/stock_identity/partition/partition_manifest_v1.json`). Pilot/exemplars and the blind arm are total exclusions; the permitted non-drawn pre-boundary pool is NOT used for this first PR-3 constant family.
- Honor the W1 calibration clock exactly: frozen calibration-partition semantics and the recent-history guard (`asof − 126 trading days`).
- The full registered drawn roster is attempted. A valid zero-fire name remains a zero-fire observation. A name with unavailable/unlawful required price/identity input is never silently dropped or substituted — the script exits with a typed blocker for Sol BEFORE any constant is set.
- The substrate output cannot feed Q1/W5 population definition, expert ranking, W3B estimability inclusion, Prophet, or any fit table. W2 pilot artifacts remain immutable. Large calibration event/history material follows the existing R2/store-host storage law; only bounded manifests/hashes/receipts are committed.

- [ ] **Step 1: Freeze the calibration replay manifest and hashes**

`calibration_replay_manifest_v1.json` records: the mechanical drawn-name roster hash from the partition manifest, the W2 family registry/spec hashes being reused, the clock/guard parameters, and the storage location contract. Committed BEFORE the substrate runs.

- [ ] **Step 2: Declare every per-constant selection rule before any value exists**

Following the W1 `scripts/stock_identity_calibrate.py` rule-before-value law: each PR-3 constant gets an explicit written selection rule in `scripts/stock_identity_calibrate_w3.py` and `W3_RULER_REGISTRATION.md`, and the sha256 of the rule text is recorded in the registration BEFORE anything runs against partition data. A test asserts the registration carries the rule hash and that the JSON spec still holds the pending sentinel at this step.

- [ ] **Step 3: Register the declared diagnostic grids and the fit-read look budget**

Register the exact declared ±20% diagnostic sensitivity grids in the TrialLedger via `engine/trial_ledger.py` BEFORE execution, and log the W5 fit-read look budget in the same registration. Diagnostic grids are never used to re-pick a constant.

- [ ] **Step 4: Execute the calibration-fire substrate**

```bash
python3 scripts/stock_identity_calibration_replay.py --manifest data/stock_identity/ruler/calibration_replay_manifest_v1.json
```

Tests assert: the replayed name set equals the drawn roster exactly (disjoint from pilot cohort and blind-arm manifest); zero-fire names appear as explicit zero-fire observations; unavailable-input names produce the typed blocker exit; no fit/rank/best column exists in any output; W2 pilot artifact bytes are unchanged; the run's provenance receipt proves actual invocation of the registered W2 replay entry points (module/function identities and the family registry/spec hashes asserted from inside the run — a hash recorded in the manifest alone is not proof the run used that machinery); no bar after `asof − 126 trading days` enters the constant-setting input (the recent-history guard is enforced in code and its violation raises); and every substrate output row/artifact carries `calibration_substrate: true`, which the Task 4 census input validators and the W5 population path REFUSE (fence test included here and mirrored in Task 4).

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the one-time constant-setting act**

`scripts/stock_identity_calibrate_w3.py` computes the constants from the substrate via the pre-declared rules, replaces the pending sentinels in `ruler_spec_v1.json`, records value + rule hash + roster hash + replay/family/spec hashes + timestamp in `W3_RULER_REGISTRATION.md`, and re-pins the final `spec_hash`. A second invocation must refuse (one-time law) — tested. Any post-value change to the rules/implementations voids the run; no constant may thereafter change without voiding the affected preregistrations.

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the calibration test suite**

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_stock_identity_w3_calibration.py -q
```

Expected: rule-hash-before-value receipts asserted; manifest-before-run proven; no pending sentinel remains; roster exactness + blind/pilot exclusion proven; zero-fire and typed-blocker semantics proven; machinery-invocation, recent-history-guard and substrate-fence assertions green; re-run refusal proven.

- [ ] **Step 6B: Re-run the real pilot smoke on the receipted spec**

```bash
python3 scripts/stock_identity_build_ruler.py --pilot --include-nulls --output-dir /tmp/si-w3a-ruler-smoke
```

Expected: both graded composites now present (this is the acceptance deferred from Task 3), all nulls present, no blind/fit/rank output.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit Task 3C**

```bash
git add scripts/stock_identity_calibration_replay.py scripts/stock_identity_calibrate_w3.py tests/test_stock_identity_w3_calibration.py data/stock_identity/ruler/calibration_replay_manifest_v1.json data/stock_identity/ruler/ruler_spec_v1.json research/stock_identity/W3_RULER_REGISTRATION.md
git commit -m "stock-identity W3A: calibration-fire substrate + one-time ruler constants"
```

### Task 4: Build the W3B estimability/dependence census

**Files:**
- Create: `engine/stock_identity/estimability.py`
- Create: `scripts/stock_identity_build_estimability.py`
- Create: `tests/test_stock_identity_estimability.py`
- Create: `data/stock_identity/census/fit_estimability_v1.schema.json`
- Create: `research/stock_identity/W3_ESTIMABILITY_REGISTRATION.md`

**Interfaces:**

```python
def validate_support_frame(support: pd.DataFrame) -> None:  # raises OutcomeLeakage on any forbidden column
    ...

def build_estimability_census(
    episodes: pd.DataFrame,
    events: pd.DataFrame,
    attribution: pd.DataFrame,
    support: pd.DataFrame,
    feature_coverage: pd.DataFrame,
    floors: "EstimabilityFloors",
) -> pd.DataFrame: ...
```

`support` is the typed outcome-independent support/coverage frame emitted by the Task 2 ruler build (`support_coverage_v1.parquet`). Its closed column contract is exactly: `episode_id`, `event_id`, `ticker`, `known_ts`, `calendar_block`, `family`, `grain`, `attributed` (bool presence, not quality), `price_coverage`, `feature_coverage`, `price_plane_id`, `availability_state` (censored/not-yet-available/structural-absence/etc.). Per Sol ruling 2026-08-28, the outcome-leakage whitelist/closed-schema validation applies to ALL census inputs, not only the support frame: `build_estimability_census` first validates `episodes`, `events`, `attribution`, `support`, and `feature_coverage` each against its own closed column schema, and raises `OutcomeLeakage` if ANY input carries a realized-fit column — `c_loc_r`, `c_loc_d`, `lead_lag`, `price_dist`, `atr_dist`, `mae_after`, `capture`, `recall_at_tier`, `zone_precision`, `false_start`, `false_start_rate`, `relative_order`, `consistency` — or any column not in that input's closed contract. Cell inclusion/estimability may never depend on how well any expert scored, through any argument. The same validators REFUSE any input row or artifact carrying `calibration_substrate: true` — the Task 3C substrate can never enter the census or the W5 population (fence test mirrored from Task 3C).

Required outputs per candidate cell include `episode_n`, `calendar_cluster_n`, `largest3_cluster_share`, `fire_n`, `fires_per_name_year`, `episode_attribution_rate`, `grain_coverage`, `feature_coverage`, `price_plane_id`, `estimability_state`, and `unestimable_reason`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add failing dependence tests**

Create a fixture with 100 episode rows concentrated in two calendar clusters. Assert `episode_n == 100` while `calendar_cluster_n == 2`, and that the cell is `UNESTIMABLE` when the registered cluster floor is >2.

- [ ] **Step 2: Add failing missingness taxonomy tests**

Assert structural expert absence, no fires despite coverage, missing feature plane, censored episode, and insufficient clusters map to distinct reason codes rather than one generic null.

- [ ] **Step 2B: Add the failing outcome-leakage regression**

Assert `build_estimability_census` raises `OutcomeLeakage` when ANY of its five inputs carries any realized-fit column (parameterized over the full forbidden list above, injected into each input in turn), and that census output on lawful inputs is byte-identical when the fixture's underlying expert quality is permuted — with ALL companion frames (`episodes`, `events`, `attribution`, `support`, `feature_coverage`) regenerated under the permutation, so forbidden realized-quality fields provably cannot influence estimability through any argument.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run red**

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_stock_identity_estimability.py -q
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement calendar-block assignment**

Use the frozen W3 ruler episode-duration distribution to set block length at least the P90 episode duration; assign episodes to calendar blocks by the registered anchor/start sensitivity rule. Do not use the W1 degenerate universe cluster component as inferential N.

- [ ] **Step 5: Implement explicit estimability state**

Closed states: `ESTIMABLE`, `UNESTIMABLE`, `NO_COVERAGE`, `STRUCTURAL_ABSENCE`, `CENSORED_ONLY`. A cell may never be represented as a numerical zero merely because it is unestimable.

- [ ] **Step 6: Run real pilot census**

```bash
python3 scripts/stock_identity_build_estimability.py --pilot --support-path /tmp/si-w3a-ruler-smoke/support_coverage_v1.parquet --output-dir /tmp/si-w3b-census
```

Expected: every candidate cell has honest episode/calendar-cluster N and a closed estimability state; no fit/composite ranking table is emitted. The script consumes ONLY the outcome-independent support artifact — never the metric/composite/null files that share the ruler output directory.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit Task 4**

```bash
git add engine/stock_identity/estimability.py scripts/stock_identity_build_estimability.py tests/test_stock_identity_estimability.py data/stock_identity/census/fit_estimability_v1.schema.json research/stock_identity/W3_ESTIMABILITY_REGISTRATION.md
git commit -m "stock-identity W3B: add estimability and dependence census"

### Task 5: Close or truthfully block the W3S terminated-instrument control

**Files:**
- Create: `engine/stock_identity/dead_control.py`
- Create: `scripts/stock_identity_build_dead_control.py`
- Create: `tests/test_stock_identity_dead_control.py`
- Create: `data/stock_identity/control/dead_instrument_manifest_v1.json`
- Create: `research/stock_identity/W3_DEAD_INSTRUMENT_CONTROL_REGISTRATION.md`

**Interfaces:**

```python
def load_delisted_sampling_frame(repo_root: Path) -> pd.DataFrame: ...
def inventory_existing_adjusted_history_owners(repo_root: Path) -> list["HistoryOwnerCandidate"]: ...
def validate_terminated_instrument(candidate: "HistoryOwnerCandidate") -> "DeadInstrumentReceipt": ...
def build_dead_control_manifest(receipts: Sequence["DeadInstrumentReceipt"]) -> dict: ...
```

The sampling frame starts from `config/delisted_symbols.yml` with `terminated_reason` recorded, per the original masterplan's dead-names clause: `load_delisted_sampling_frame` reads that file and is the sole source of candidate terminated identities; the owner inventory then determines which canonical adjusted-history plane can supply each tape. Consequence law is fixed and no new statistical kill threshold is invented: fewer than 5 lawful instruments => `BLOCKED_NO_LAWFUL_DATA` and W5P/Q1 stay blocked; >=5 => the cohort MUST enter the W5 survivorship control/report, and its performance does not independently pass or fail Q1 unless a future separately preregistered criterion says so.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the source-owner inventory test**

The inventory function must enumerate current canonical/registered adjusted-history owners before any network/source adapter code is allowed. The test fails if an implementation imports a new collector/provider module without a recorded owner verdict in the registration document. A companion test asserts the candidate identity set comes exactly from `load_delisted_sampling_frame` over `config/delisted_symbols.yml` (with `terminated_reason` present per row) and that no candidate is minted from any other list.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write terminated-identity/hygiene tests**

A valid receipt requires: instrument identity, terminal reason, terminal date, price source, adjustment mode, first/last date, OHLCV coverage, source/rights note, correction semantics, and reused-ticker hygiene result. A live ticker relabeled as dead must fail.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write fingerprint/episode compatibility test**

Each accepted control tape must pass through existing `engine.stock_identity.fingerprint` and `engine.stock_identity.episodes` entry points with the same adjustment/identity semantics as the study cohort.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run red**

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_stock_identity_dead_control.py -q
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Implement owner-first inventory and validation**

No general market-data platform is created. If an existing canonical owner satisfies the contract, the manifest references it. If fewer than five lawful terminated instruments can be produced, the script exits nonzero with typed status `BLOCKED_NO_LAWFUL_DATA` and writes only a non-authoritative diagnostic receipt; W5 remains blocked.

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the real control build**

```bash
python3 scripts/stock_identity_build_dead_control.py --min-instruments 5 --output data/stock_identity/control/dead_instrument_manifest_v1.json
```

Expected either:

- success with >=5 validated terminated instruments and immutable hashes; or
- fail-closed `BLOCKED_NO_LAWFUL_DATA`, with no fake survivor substitute.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit Task 5**

```bash
git add engine/stock_identity/dead_control.py scripts/stock_identity_build_dead_control.py tests/test_stock_identity_dead_control.py data/stock_identity/control/dead_instrument_manifest_v1.json research/stock_identity/W3_DEAD_INSTRUMENT_CONTROL_REGISTRATION.md
git commit -m "stock-identity W3S: establish terminated-instrument control"
```

If the real run returns `BLOCKED_NO_LAWFUL_DATA`, commit the registration/typed blocker and tests but do not fabricate a successful manifest.

### Task 6: W3 release integration, fences, and return packet

**Files:**
- Modify: CI registry/job file only through the current house pattern selected by current main at implementation time; no new standalone workflow.
- Modify: `agentos/workstreams/WS-STOCK-IDENTITY.md`
- Create: `agentos/handoffs/STOCK-IDENTITY-<current-date>-W3-measurement-release.md` on the implementation carrier with the exact calendar date of the actual return.
- Modify: `research/stock_identity/W3_RULER_REGISTRATION.md`
- Modify: `research/stock_identity/W3_ESTIMABILITY_REGISTRATION.md`
- Modify: `research/stock_identity/W3_DEAD_INSTRUMENT_CONTROL_REGISTRATION.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces a W3 milestone packet containing exact PR/head, ruler spec hash, artifact hashes, test/CI receipts, real pilot smoke, survivorship status, all unverified claims, and the exact W4 gate.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the current-house CI job for only the new W3 tests**

Use the current Macro CI registry semantics at pickup; do not add a duplicate GitHub Actions workflow. The job must run the ruler, null, estimability, dead-control unit suites plus existing W1/W2 Stock Identity guards.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the complete local Stock Identity suite**

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_stock_identity_ruler.py tests/test_stock_identity_w3_calibration.py tests/test_stock_identity_ruler_nulls.py tests/test_stock_identity_model_constitution.py tests/test_stock_identity_estimability.py tests/test_stock_identity_dead_control.py -q
```

Then run every pre-existing Stock Identity W1/W2 test file selected by current CI planning.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run protected-path diff fences**

```bash
git diff --stat origin/main...HEAD -- engine/entry_signal.py engine/signal_gate.py engine/confluence_tiers.py engine/signal_quality.py 'engine/prophet_*.py' engine/stock_personality.py engine/oracle/personality_context.py scripts/build_stock_library.py engine/entry_radar
```

Expected: empty.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run Agent OS validation**

```bash
python3 scripts/agentos.py validate
```

Expected: 0 errors attributable to W3 changes.

- [ ] **Step 5: Update `WS:STOCK-IDENTITY` truthfully**

Mark W3 sub-capabilities individually. A successful W3A/W3B with W3S blocked must not mark the full W3 Measurement Release done. W4 stays held until Sol adjudicates the milestone packet.

- [ ] **Step 6: Push and obtain exact-head hosted CI**

Return exact head SHA and hosted `fences`/`ci` run IDs. Do not call a local pass acceptance.

- [ ] **Step 7: Post `RESULT SI-W3-MEASUREMENT-RELEASE` in the shared Slack thread**

The message includes exact PR/head, capability deltas, whether W3S is successful or blocked, and the immutable Agent OS handoff ref. Then enter the approved exact-thread wait/watch path. Do not self-start W4.

- [ ] **Step 8: Stop at Sol review**

Sol applies `REVIEW_RETURN.md` against exact head. Only a Sol `CONTINUE` after accepted W3 Measurement Release permits a new W4 operation/carrier.

---

## Plan self-review

- Spec coverage: W3A deterministic ruler, one-time sealed-calibration constant-setting with rule-before-value and look budget and the bounded calibration-fire substrate (Task 3C), frozen composites, unconditional block, grain/null controls, the Channel-A model constitution / capacity budget (Task 3B), W3B honest-N/estimability on an outcome-independent support frame, W3S survivorship from the `config/delisted_symbols.yml` frame, protected paths, real smoke, hosted CI and milestone return are all assigned explicit tasks.
- The W3B census provably cannot read realized localization/composite quality; the W5 population is outcome-independent.
- The W3S consequence matrix is unchanged: the control can block or enter the W5 report, never independently kill Q1.
- No Q1 outcome opening occurs in this plan.
- No W4 epoch implementation is smuggled into W3.
- No downstream consumer path is preclaimed.
- No duplicate event/replay/data/control plane is introduced.
- Failure to obtain terminated-instrument data remains a typed blocker rather than an invented substitute.
