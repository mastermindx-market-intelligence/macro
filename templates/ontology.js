/* ontology.js — F04-X1 WTI Live Trace client.
   Paired plain-copy asset: templates/ontology.js and site/ontology.js must stay
   byte-identical (scripts/check_template_site_sync.py).

   This file is the ONLY place a current value enters the page. The shell that
   ships to the public CDN contains none, and nothing read here is written back
   to any browser store — the response is `private, no-store` on the wire, and
   persisting it client-side would undo that in one line.

   The vocabulary rules this file follows are product law, not style:
     * no internal state names, study names or raw slugs reach the reader; every
       leg is named by its own bilingual title
     * no refutation language on a user surface. The chain's falsifiers are real
       and keep evaluating, but they are presented as what we are watching, not
       as a thesis being refuted
     * an unavailable comparison is stated as unavailable. "Nothing changed" is
       a different claim and this data cannot support it */
