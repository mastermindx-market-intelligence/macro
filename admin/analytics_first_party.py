"""First-party analytics reader — the self-hosted alternative to Umami/GA4.

Reads the shared Supabase analytics tables (analytics_events, search_events, ip_geo — created by
the Terminal repo's supabase/migrations/0004_analytics.sql + 0003_search_events.sql) through the
Management API SQL endpoint, exactly like users.py: a read-only SELECT with the sbp_… PAT, no
service_role JWT stored, nothing exposed to the browser. All SQL is static text authored here; the
only interpolated values are int-clamped (days/limit) or allowlist-validated ids (session/visitor),
so there is no injection surface.

Surfaces (all return the {ok, …} / {ok:False, reason} envelope the SPA expects):
  overview   headline counts + by-site split + daily series
  pages      top pages/paths by views + unique visitors
  geo        visitor map — by country and by city (lat/lon for plotting)
  sessions   recent VISITS (per-tab/per-origin session_ids stitched — see _visit_break)
  session    the ordered event path of ONE visit (the 1:1 replay)
  flow       navigation patterns — from→to path-pair counts (window over each session)
  terminal   Terminal usage — top tickers SEARCHED (search_events) and VIEWED (ticker_view)
  visitor    identity stitch — one visitor's sessions/IPs/fingerprints + linked visitor_ids
  realtime   distinct visitors/sessions active in the last 5 minutes
  geo_enrich_now  on-demand IPLocate backfill (subprocesses scripts/geo_enrich.py)

# phone gives ONE cookie across many IPs; only a farm is wide on both axes. On this dataset
# the split is unambiguous — one fp at 74 cookies / 74 IPs across 8 countries (Oxylabs,

# Management API, and admin.mastermind-x.com is served THROUGH a CDN edge (see the
# admin block in app/deploy/Caddyfile) — so an endpoint that outruns the edge's
# origin-pull timeout does not fail as this module's {ok:False,...} envelope. It
# fails as the EDGE's error response, which reaches app.js as a body that is not
# JSON at all. That is the "bad json" the console was reporting: not a serialization
# bug in here, a request that never got to finish.
#
# Bounding the whole surface below the edge's patience is what makes the failure
# legible: whatever else goes wrong, the operator gets a JSON error naming the
# timeout instead of a gateway page the SPA can only describe as malformed.
#
# 22.0 was NOT below it. Measured on production 2026-08-26: `overview` folded in
# 14.9s at the origin and the admin journal recorded BrokenPipeError writing the
# response — the edge had already hung up and answered the browser 524 with an
# empty body, which is exactly the panel error the operator was looking at. So the
# budget has to sit under the edge's real patience, and the evidence says that is
# somewhere below 15s. The edge's exact configured origin-pull timeout is NOT
# measured here (it is EdgeOne zone config, not repo state; 15s is its documented
# default and matches what we observed) — 10s is chosen to be under it with room
# to spare, and to stay far above what these panels now actually cost: after the
