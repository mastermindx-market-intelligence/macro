    the concurrency possible and safe:

      * the ahead/behind count is asked for against the `@{u}` REVISION rather than the

        there is no upstream, git exits non-zero and we report 0/0 — the same answer the
        sequential `if upstream:` guard produced.
      * the dirty check passes `-uno`. Walking the working tree for UNTRACKED files was
        ~3x the cost of the entire rest of the call (measured 2026-08-19), and it cannot
        change this answer: `_FILE` is tracked, so its porcelain status never depends on
        what untracked files exist beside it.

    git subprocesses release the GIL while they run, so the wall time is the slowest

    Same allowlist, same confirm gate, same scoped commit, same never-push-off-a-

    ONE ``git push`` and a refusal strands the commit on this disk forever. On the
    deployed VPS that is a routine outcome, not an edge case — the press wire
    commits every few minutes, so origin has usually moved between the read and
    the push, and a stranded outbox row is a post the publisher never sees.

    So: on a refused push, ``git fetch`` then ``git rebase`` onto the upstream and
    try again, up to ``attempts`` pushes. This is only safe because the callers'
    files are append-only ledgers carrying merge=union in .gitattributes — the
    driver resolves a concurrent-append collision by keeping both sides, and the
    readers fold id-first so a duplicated row is inert. Never ``push -f``, never
    ``reset``: this function may lose no one else's commit.

    Two honest non-delivery outcomes:
      * attempts exhausted -> {ok: True, committed: True, pushed: False, warning}.
        The commit is real, so this is not an error — but it is not delivery
        either, and on the deployed VPS it is not durable: that checkout pulls
        with ``git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD`` (app/deploy/update.sh) every few
        minutes, which discards an unpushed commit. The warning says only what is
        true: committed here, not on main.
      * the rebase itself conflicts -> ``git rebase --abort`` (never leave the
