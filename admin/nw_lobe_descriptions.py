"""Plain-English descriptions for Neural Web lobes (admin Observatory).

AUTO-MANAGED by scripts/nw_lobe_desc_audit.py — do not hand-edit `src_fp`.
Edit a lobe's `short`/`full` prose freely, then run:

    python scripts/nw_lobe_desc_audit.py --update

to re-stamp `src_fp` (the fingerprint of the synapse note the prose describes).

`src_fp` is how the console knows a description is still current: if a lobe's
synapse note changes but this prose isn't refreshed, the fingerprints diverge and
the description is flagged 'stale' in the UI, and tests/test_nw_lobe_descriptions.py
fails CI. A lobe with an empty `short` renders an auto-generated summary until real
prose is written here. Run `--update` (no seed) after adding a lobe or editing prose.

Shared parent suspect: confirms edges in the confluence graph whose two endpoint engines sit in the same R-ORTH independence cluster and additionally share a common driver family in the causal inventory — flagged as potential shared-parent artifacts rather than independent confirmation. Collider risk: mechanism cards that condition on downstream composites named in the forbidden-causes list (board_rank, final_verdict, and similar), which may open a collider back-door path.

        "full": "Each night the stage-analysis builder classifies every stock in the universe into one of the four Weinstein stages (basing, advancing, topping, declining) using completed weekly bars and a 30-week trend line, then writes a context snapshot. It summarizes the market weather (what share of stocks is advancing versus declining, and which stage the broad market is in), lists the freshest early-advance names on a Fresh Stage 2 board, and tracks which sectors are strengthening. Each board name carries a display-tier quality score, an early-advance freshness flag, a relative-strength chip, and — where a call has been read — an earnings-tone chip; none of these may be used as a signal or position-sizing input, and the earnings-call scores stay context-only until a separate promotion test clears. A same-day change-feed distinguishes fresh entries, exits, breakouts, and stage transitions from the prior state. The artifact carries an explicit is_context_only flag, and every consumer fails open when the file is absent, so it is harmless until the builder first runs.",

The hard caveat embedded in the artifact states explicitly that this is not a buy score and that no behavior-changing consumer is wired.
