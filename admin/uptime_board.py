"""Live uptime/latency probes for every public surface of the site.

Each probe is an independent HTTP GET with a short timeout; they run concurrently
and the results return together so the panel shows one board. Stateless — probes
on demand. (content.py keeps the older single-URL probe; this is the multi-host
board.)"""
