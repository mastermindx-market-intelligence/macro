"""Did this request reach us THROUGH the CDN edge, or direct-to-origin?

Everything in the admin console that treats an IP as an identity — the per-client
login lockout in ``auth.password_ok``, the site-gate self-allow list — depends on
being able to answer that question, and it stopped being answerable when
admin.mastermind-x.com moved behind the TencentEdgeOne edge.

WHY THIS EXISTS (measured 2026-08-07, not theoretical). ``app/deploy/Caddyfile``
injects ``X-Admin-Client-IP {remote_host}`` — the verified TCP peer, with
``header_up`` REPLACING any caller-supplied value so it cannot be spoofed. That is
still exactly right and this module does not change it. What changed is what the
peer MEANS: admin is edge-proxied (CNAME -> admin.mastermind-x.com.eo.dnse3.com),
so for every visitor arriving through the edge the peer is an EdgeOne origin-pull
address, not the visitor. All edge-borne traffic therefore shared ONE lockout
bucket, which inverted ``auth.py``'s stated property — "one attacker can only lock
out *themselves*" — into an anonymous operator-lockout DoS: five wrong passwords
from anywhere on the internet locked the operator out of their own console.

WHAT THE EDGE ACTUALLY SETS, and why only one header is usable. Probing the live
host through the edge with every real-client header forged (2026-08-07, headers
captured off the loopback hop to :8787 with tcpdump):

    sent through the edge        arrived at the origin as
    EO-Connecting-IP: 203.0.113.77   ->  104.36.50.44   (OVERWRITTEN — true client)
    EO-Client-IP:     203.0.113.99   ->  203.0.113.99   (passed through — FORGED)
    True-Client-IP:   203.0.113.66   ->  203.0.113.66   (passed through — FORGED)
    X-Real-IP:        203.0.113.55   ->  203.0.113.55   (passed through — FORGED)
    CF-Connecting-IP: 203.0.113.44   ->  203.0.113.44   (passed through — FORGED)
    X-Forwarded-For:  198.51.100.7   ->  <dropped by the edge; Caddy re-set to peer>

So ``EO-Connecting-IP`` is the ONLY header the edge rewrites, and it is the only
one this module will ever read. A clean edge request carries no ``EO-Client-IP`` at
all — the EdgeOne "Client IP Header" rule is not active on this zone — so reading
that header would have handed a brute-forcer a free bucket-rotation knob. Do not
add it here.

THE ``EO-Client-IP`` ROW IS ABOUT ADMIN.* ONLY. Re-probing www.mastermind-x.com the
same way on 2026-08-07 found the rule IS active there: a clean www request carries
``EO-Client-IP``, and a forged copy arrives OVERWRITTEN with the true client. Both
measurements are real and they disagree because the zones are configured
differently, so neither table is an estate-wide statement — re-probe the zone you
are working on. The public-site resolver is ``app/edge_client.py``; it reads only
``EO-Connecting-IP`` precisely because that is the row that holds on both zones.

DO NOT ROUTE app/ THROUGH ``from_edge``. This module's attestation exists because
admin's edge sets no per-visitor header at all, so the only choice here is "attested
visitor or shared peer bucket". www has a true per-visitor ``EO-Connecting-IP`` on
every edge request, and with no attestation configured (see the range-list problem
below, still unsolved) gating it would collapse every www visitor into ONE bucket —
re-creating on the public site exactly the operator-lockout DoS this module fixed
for admin. ``app/edge_client.py``'s header states this at length.

THE PEER CHECK IS THE WHOLE SECURITY PROPERTY. ufw permits 80,443/tcp from
Anywhere, so anyone can reach the origin directly and send whatever
``EO-Connecting-IP`` they like. A forwarded header is worth reading only once the
TCP PEER has been established as an edge address by something the caller does not
control. That is what this module decides, and it fails safe: when it cannot
attest the peer, callers keep using the verified peer as the identity, which is
the pre-existing behaviour and gives up nothing that worked before.

TWO INDEPENDENT ATTESTATIONS, EITHER SUFFICIENT, BOTH OFF BY DEFAULT:

  1. ``ADMIN_EDGE_SECRET`` — a shared secret the EdgeOne console injects on
     origin-pull as ``X-MM-Edge-Auth`` (Rules Engine -> "modify origin-pull request
     header"). Compared in constant time. This is the CIDR-FREE path and the one to
     prefer: it needs no IP list, so it cannot rot, and it is unaffected by the
     edge adding nodes. A direct-to-origin caller cannot produce the header without
     the secret. Runbook: ``app/deploy/README.md`` § "Admin per-client identity".

  2. ``ADMIN_EDGE_ORIGIN_CIDRS`` (or ``config/edgeone_origin_ranges.json``) — the
     EdgeOne origin-pull ranges, for an operator who has pulled them from the
     console's Origin Protection page / the ``DescribeOriginProtection`` API.

BOTH DEFAULT TO EMPTY ON PURPOSE, and mechanism 2 has no shipped list, because as of
2026-08-07 there is NO usable authoritative EdgeOne origin-pull range list:

  * ``https://api.edgeone.ai/ips`` was the credential-free published list. It is
    DEPRECATED — fetched 2026-08-07 it answers 200 with, in full:
        # [DEPRECATION NOTICE] This interface stopped serving on 2026-07-31 and
        # will be officially offline on 2026-08-31. Please migrate in time.
        0.0.0.0/0
        ::/0
    Read that twice. The dead endpoint serves a DEFAULT ROUTE as its payload, so any
    refresh job that ingests it without rejecting blanket ranges silently produces a
    trust-EVERYTHING allowlist. For a firewall that is merely useless; here it would
    be catastrophic, because every direct-to-origin caller would become "the edge"
    and could forge its own identity at will. ``_safe_network`` below refuses such
    entries unconditionally, and that refusal is not configurable.
  * The successor, ``DescribeOriginACL`` (teo 2022-09-01, replacing the deprecated
    ``DescribeOriginProtection``), needs Tencent Cloud SecretId/SecretKey. This
    infrastructure holds no such credential (no TENCENT/EDGEONE/QCLOUD key in any
    /etc/macro-*.env, no tccli on the VPS), so it cannot be pulled here today.

A GUESSED range is worse than no range. Too NARROW merely degrades to the old
peer-keyed behaviour; too BROAD is exploitable — the observed origin-pull addresses
sit in Tencent /16s under AS139341 that also host rentable Tencent Cloud VMs, and
none of the 378 observed peers has a PTR record to distinguish an edge node from a
neighbour. Under-trusting costs availability; over-trusting costs the throttle.
This module refuses to guess. Mechanism 1 is the one to actually turn on.
