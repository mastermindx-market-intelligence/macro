"""Marketing floor — the operator's view *inside* the content factory.

Three read-only panels, all fail-soft (NEVER-RAISE; an unreadable file degrades
one field to ``None`` with a plain-word note, it never breaks the panel):

* :func:`floor`  — the production line. One honest count per station plus the
  named loss at each one, the ranked blockers, and tonight's authorship split.
* :func:`models` — which model wrote the words, and the OAuth key-pool
  balancer's belief state per key.
* :func:`lanes`  — the X-growth lanes (press wire, hot tape, filings, intel,
  replies) with a live/dark verdict and a freshness read each.

Why this module exists (operator, 2026-07-29): "it's like a factory with its
window panes all tinted and me as the CEO unable to see the inside." Every
number the engines already compute was being dropped on the floor — the
publisher writes a 25-counter loss ledger per run and the console rendered five
of them; the gate records a per-post reason for all 526 holds and the console
rendered a total. This module surfaces what already exists. It computes no new
truth and it never writes.

REDLINE: no secret VALUE ever crosses this boundary. The key-pool view carries
capability-id NAMES, cooling state, and load percentages only — never a token.

    ``written`` counts plan posts carrying ``_copy_mode`` while ``cleared`` is
    the sentinel's ``counts.passed`` measured over the WHOLE plan queue.  On the

    impossible transition into a confident "nothing lost here" and then let the
    NEXT station charge a fabricated 128-post loss to an enqueue gap that does
    not exist (defect F2).  A funnel that silently clamps a non-monotone pair is
    a lie in layout form.

    So: when ``out > in`` the station is marked ``odd`` and publishes NO loss and
    NO yield, and every station from there down carries ``chain_ok: False`` —
    their own ``lost`` is arithmetic over a denominator that means something
