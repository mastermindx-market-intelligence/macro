"""admin/marketing.py — Marketing NW lobe admin page.

Panel payloads for GET /api/marketing/{overview,departments,channels,campaigns,
experiments,lobes,content,radar}.  All sources are fail-soft (try/except → None/[]).
Panels read only committed artifacts; they never write.

The single source of truth is data/neuralweb/marketing_state.json (marketing.state/v1).
Radar additionally reads data/marketing/radar_report.json + cashtag_tiers.json.
config/marketing.yml is read for the settings echo.

All public functions return {"ok": True, ...} or {"ok": False, "error": ...}.
If the state file is absent they return ok:True with empty/null sections and
an honest accruing note — so the page renders gracefully on day 0.

# already owns the correct primitive for "the same post said better":
# `engine.marketing.rewrite.apply_rewrite`, which quarantines the original FIRST
# (freeing its own replacement from the near-dup guard) and enqueues the
# replacement second, never leaving both live. This path is that primitive with

      minutes, so a local commit is not slow delivery — it is DELETED delivery,
      taking the row with it.
    * Authenticated local checkout -> scoped commit + ONE plain push
      (``gitops.commit_paths``): no rebase retry, because this checkout may be
      occupied by other agents and a rebase rewrites it under them (review N6).
      A push refused by a racing press-wire commit is reported, not forced.

    Exactly one is attempted per call. Never both: a fallback would either write
    the same row twice or spend a doomed git shell-out on every VPS approval.
    (A ``root=``-pinned call never gets here — see the call site.)

    Returns ``(delivered, note)``. ``delivered`` is True ONLY when the row is on
    main. Every other outcome returns False plus a plain-word sentence — this

    snapshot server-side and the text that reaches the outbox is the desk's own,
    so a tampered or merely stale browser payload cannot post copy no gate saw.

    The chain is the CANONICAL one ``engine/marketing/press_lane.py`` runs, in
    its order, because a second emission path with its own gate order is how a
    lane quietly ends up with weaker guards than the one it copied:

    owns getting the row there — by commit+push on an authenticated checkout, or

    never enforced — a failure leaves the item queued and returns
    ``delivered: False`` with a plain-word note, because the item is real on disk
    either way and un-queueing it would be the actual data loss. A ``root=``
    pinned call attempts no delivery and carries no ``delivered`` key.

    GATES REFUSE WHEN THEY CANNOT RUN. This is publish-adjacent, so the polarity
    is the opposite of the display-tier panels above: a gate whose import or read
    fails returns a refusal, never a pass. That is a deliberate divergence from
    press_lane, which proceeds when the story lock cannot be consulted so an

# Reply desk (XG-W4)

# The reply queue is a SEPARATE store from the outbox and lives in HOST state
# (~/.mastermind/reply_desk), not the repo: Buffer cannot post replies, so a
# reply must never be mistaken for a postable outbox item, and the M1 is the
# nightly render host so nothing may write inside the checkout intraday.
#
# `store` here is the host-state root (reply_queue.state_dir), NOT the repo root
# — the two are different directories and conflating them is how a poller ends
# up dirtying the render tree.

    ONE function on purpose: the dangerous half of opening a reply panel is the
    lease release, and two copies of it are two chances for one of them to drift
    into releasing a lease whose receipt is still pending.

    Order is `reply_export.sweep`'s order: release leases FIRST so an item whose
    desktop session died is reclaimable, then expire. Expiring before releasing
    would leave an in-flight item unreachable.

    ``skip_ids`` is NOT optional. A panel read that releases a lease whose
    receipt is still pending drops the item to `queued`, which has no edge to
    `sent` — so ingest then fails with illegal_transition and a reply that is
    already PUBLIC goes permanently uncounted while the cap hands its slot back.
    Opening an admin page must not be able to do that.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE REPLY DECK — the surface the operator actually works
#
# `reply_queue()` above is the rail that shipped with XG-W4: it lists what is in
# the store. That is enough to prove the store works and not enough to DECIDE
# with, because approving a reply is a judgement about a conversation and the
# rail shows one half of it — our draft, with the parent reduced to an excerpt
# and the reason this target was chosen at all reduced to a row of float
# contributions with no labels.
#
# The deck is the other half. Three things the rail does not carry:
#
#   1. THE PARENT BESIDE THE DRAFT, with the score's own features rendered as
#      the sentences they encode ("posted 8 minutes ago — inside the 5-15 minute
#      window", "3 replies so far — the thread has room"). The numbers are
#      `reply_score`'s, unchanged; only the labels are new. An operator who
#      cannot see WHY the machine picked a target cannot tell a good pick from a
#      lucky one, and the whole scoring hypothesis stays ungraded.
#
#   2. AN HONEST DARK STATE. This desk has FIVE independent arming keys (the
#      daemon lane, `producer.enabled`, a curated register, the mode dial, and
#      the voice pair) and four of them fail SILENTLY — an empty register polls
#      cleanly and produces nothing, which reads as "quiet desk", not "dark
#      desk". `_reply_dark_reasons` reads each key from the tree it actually
#      lives in and names the ones that are off, so an empty deck says why it is
#      empty instead of implying there was nothing worth replying to.
#
#   3. THE EXPORT/RECEIPT STATE PER ITEM. Approving is not sending. At M0
#      approval parks the item forever by design; at M1 it is mirrored, claimed
#      by a desktop session, sent, and confirmed back by a receipt file. Four
#      states with four different operator meanings, none of which the rail
#      distinguished from "approved".
#
# WRITES. The deck's decide/skip actions go through `decide_reply`/
# `reject_reply` above — the real store API, no second write path. The one new
# write is the edit (`edit_reply`), and it is a SUPERSESSION rather than an
# overwrite for the same reason the outbox edit is: `reply_queue._item_id`
# hashes account|thread_key|draft|as_of, so a row whose text changed under a
# kept id is a row whose id no longer describes its content.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    gaps ("Cici runs Asia hours, the others US hours — a desk replying at 3am in
    its own time zone reads as a bot").

    NOT INVENTED FOR THIS PANEL. The windows come from `cadence.session` in the
    committed persona specs and are resolved through `cadence_resolver`, the
    same module the publisher uses, so the deck cannot disagree with the lane
    about when a desk is awake. A desk whose spec declares no session is ALWAYS
    in window — that is `in_session`'s own semantics, and it is reported as
    "no territory clock" rather than as a live burst, because a permanent window
    is not a burst and calling it one would make the header meaningless.

    "How many remain in it" is deliberately TWO numbers: items waiting on this
    desk, and the send headroom its cap allows. They bind independently, and an
    operator with nine drafts and two slots left needs to see both.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The edit path — a SUPERSESSION, re-screened by the real critics
#
# WHY THE OPERATOR MAY EDIT AT ALL. The rail's only controls were approve, hold
# and reject, so a draft that was 90% right had one outcome: rejection, and a
# thread we had a genuine read on went unanswered inside its 15-minute window.
# Rejecting a nearly-right reply also poisons the taste corpus, which is the one
# signal that says what this desk should sound like.
#
# WHY IT IS NOT AN OVERWRITE. `reply_queue._item_id` hashes
# account|thread_key|draft|as_of. A row whose text changed under a kept id is a
# row whose id no longer describes its content, and the store's own duplicate
# and near-dup machinery keys off that id.
#
# WHY THE CRITICS RUN AGAIN, NOT AS A COURTESY. `reply_queue.validate_item`
# refuses any item without a full-roster PASSING stamp, so a superseding item
# cannot enter the store unless the critics actually cleared the new text. The
# operator is a second writer, and the queue is a bypass around every generation
# law unless the gate is in front of him too.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#: Actor on every ledger row an operator reply-edit writes, so "what did the
#: edit button do" is an exact ledger query.

    """The critic ctx for re-screening edited reply copy.

    Built to match `reply_producer`'s ctx field for field, because a gate that
    sees a different context is a different gate. Two deliberate differences:

      * `corpus` EXCLUDES the item being edited. The near-dup critic compares
        against our own recent drafts, and the draft being rewritten is by
        construction the nearest neighbour of its own rewrite — leaving it in
        would reject every small edit as a repeat of itself. This is the same
        reasoning `rewrite.apply_rewrite` encodes by quarantining first.

        The rows are built HERE rather than by calling `reply_producer._corpus`,
        which is otherwise the exact shape wanted: that helper projects each
        item down to {draft, account} and drops the id, so there would be
        nothing left to exclude the edited item BY. Same window (fleet-wide,
        last 200, no status filter) so the gate sees the same corpus it would
        during a producer tick.

      * `numbers_whitelist` is the ORIGINAL DRAFT's number tokens, not the
        own-feed whitelist the producer used — which `make_item` does not
        persist. This is strictly TIGHTER than the permission the machine had:
        the draft passed `fact_discipline`, so its numbers are a subset of the
        whitelist that cleared it. The operator may keep any figure the machine
        already vetted and may not introduce one, which is exactly the law a
        hand-edited reply needs.
