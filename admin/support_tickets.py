"""admin/support_tickets.py — operator support console (SEE W1, masterplan §5).

The read + write surface over ``public.support_tickets`` / ``support_ticket_messages``.

**One data plane, no new secret.** Everything here — reads AND writes — runs through
``admin/users.py::_query``, the Supabase **Management-API SQL** endpoint authenticated by
the ``SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`` PAT the admin service already holds (admin/settings.py). That
endpoint executes INSERT/UPDATE as well as SELECT, so the operator console needs no
service-role JWT added to /etc/macro-admin.env. This mirrors admin/entitlements.py's READ
plane; it deliberately does NOT mirror its WRITE plane, because there is no second writer
to stay consistent with — these two tables have exactly one writer besides the public
intake, and it is this module.

**Injection posture.** The Management endpoint takes a SQL string, not bound parameters,
so every value is either (a) validated against a fixed allow-list, (b) int-clamped, (c) a
strict-regex uuid or ticket-ref prefix, or (d) passed through :func:`_lit`, which caps
length, strips NULs, and doubles single quotes. (c) and (d) are not alternatives for the
ref prefix — it is regex-proved hex AND quoted through ``_lit``. Postgres runs with ``standard_conforming_strings=on`` (the default,
and Supabase's), so a doubled-quote literal is closed correctly and a backslash is just a
backslash. Ticket bodies are stranger-written text — this is the sharp edge of the module
and it is why nothing reaches SQL unescaped.

**Transition law.** Four operator actions over four statuses, and only the sanctioned
steps are legal (the allies_store.py pattern):

    reply    : open|pending          -> pending    (+ appends a message, + emails the user)
    resolve  : open|pending          -> resolved
    close    : open|pending|resolved -> closed
    reopen   : resolved|closed       -> open

Replying to a resolved/closed ticket is refused rather than silently reopening it — the
operator reopens explicitly, so the status always reflects a decision someone made.

**Mail is best-effort, the record is not.** A reply is appended to the thread FIRST, then
emailed; the message's ``emailed`` flag records what actually happened, so a mail-off
window is visible in the thread instead of being lost. app/mailer.py never raises, so a
dead relay degrades the action's ``email_status``, never the action.
