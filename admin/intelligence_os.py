"""Intelligence OS operator panel — Eval OS T1/T4/T7/T8, derived on demand.

WHAT THIS SURFACE IS. One row per intelligence ENGINE (the T1 unit of account: a
``producer::owner_program`` cell), carrying the adjudicated ``output_class`` and
``authority`` T1 assigned it, plus the worst OUTPUT HEALTH state T4 resolved across the
engine's artifacts. Drilling into an engine shows the full ``mastermind.output_health.v1``
record for each of its outputs — which plane decided the state, against which watermark,
with which reason codes. A1 adds one derived evidence disposition per engine and the five
global CEO bands, carrying T1 owner lifecycle/semantics, T4 trust, and qledger evidence only
where an existing owner binding resolves.

WHAT IT IS NOT. There is no numeric evidence score, performance rank, weight, size,
promotion service or gate here. ``output_class`` is read from T1 and is ``null`` wherever no
adjudication exists. A guessed class would be an authority claim wearing a census's clothes,
so the null is rendered as a null. Qledger readiness is measurement evidence only; the
existing species/prereg/gauntlet owners remain the sole source of validation authority.

NOTHING IS EVER WRITTEN. Not a cache file, not a snapshot, not a "last known good".
The whole view is re-derived from ``config/synapse.yml``, the T1 overlay and the estate
itself, and lives only in this process's memory (:data:`_CACHE`) for :data:`_TTL_S`
seconds. There is no stable input to pin a committed health artifact against — the
registry alone took 69 commits in a trailing fortnight — so a persisted copy would be a
second source of truth that goes wrong quietly. Same law as the T4 CLI it calls.

REFLECTIVITY. Nothing about the estate is enumerated here. Engines, artifacts, classes
and authorities all arrive from the derivation; an engine added to ``synapse.yml``
tonight appears on this page tomorrow with no edit to this file, and one removed
disappears. The only hand-written vocabulary is the state ORDER
(:data:`STATE_SEVERITY`), which is the T4 precedence ladder, not a fact about the estate.

``trust_mtime`` IS ALWAYS FALSE HERE, AND THE DEPLOYED PLANE IS THE REASON, NOT THE
EXCEPTION. A file's mtime is freshness evidence only where the PRODUCER is the sole
writer of that file, and on the VPS it is not: ``app/deploy/update.sh`` deploys with
``git fetch && git reset --hard``, so every file git rewrites is stamped with the PULL
time. A deploy or a rollback would therefore restamp the tree and make the 63 artifacts
that declare an SLA but no watermark read "fresh" — an entire class of frozen stores
reporting current because somebody deployed. The developer-checkout hazard is the same
shape (``git status`` sweeps, Finder visits and ``reflog expire`` restamp mtimes,
measured across the fleet pinning 137 of 143 DEAD worktrees as "fresh"), which is why
this panel admits write-time evidence on NO plane. Those artifacts stay
``could_not_look``/``partial`` with ``write_time_untrusted`` — the honest answer, and a
standing argument for declaring a watermark rather than for trusting a clock nobody
controls. The T4 CLI keeps ``--trust-mtime`` for an operator on a plane whose mtimes
really are producer-owned; nothing in this module can set it.
