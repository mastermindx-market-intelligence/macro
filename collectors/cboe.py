"""CBOE collectors: daily put/call ratios and SPX dealer-gamma (GEX).

GEX methodology (standard open-source convention, e.g. gex-tracker):
  dealers assumed long calls / short puts ->
    call GEX(strike) = +gamma * OI * 100 * spot^2 * 0.01
    put  GEX(strike) = -gamma * OI * 100 * spot^2 * 0.01
  net GEX = sum over strikes (expressed in $bn per 1% move);
  gamma flip = the zero-gamma spot from a ±25% grid reevaluation of net dealer gamma
    (engine/gex_engine._gamma_flip, same convention as collectors/deribit).
The earlier cumulative-by-strike zero-crossing is undefined whenever net GEX ends
negative (the cumsum never re-crosses zero), which blanked the dashboard banner for
every short-gamma session 2026-06-24 -> 07-28.
This is an assumption, not ground truth — see LIMITATIONS.md. Delayed chain,
EOD cadence: a regime/vol-context input, not a day-trading tool.

    """Store-level NYSE-session coverage tripwire for the delayed-chain family.

    The 2026-07-27 miss was invisible to every existing layer: putcall FAILED but
    graceful degradation kept the run green; gex returned 7/10 symbols so the source
    was 'ok' and detect_stale_series (which only sees RETURNED frames) had nothing to
    flag; the store-level cor/vol tripwire does not cover this family; and every
    tail-age check went green again the next evening when 07-28 landed — a one-day
    hole is permanently invisible to any last-obs check after one day. So this check
    asks for MEMBERSHIP of each of the last `lookback_sessions` expected NYSE sessions
    (weekend/holiday-dated snapshot rows can never mask a missing session date), and a
    miss stays loud for a week rather than one silent evening. Warn/alert only — it
    writes run_status stale_series entries and prints line-start ::warning/::error
    annotations (bare print, NEVER via a logger — the prefixing format would make
    GitHub drop them); it never fails the lane."""
