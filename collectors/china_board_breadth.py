"""Whole-board A-share 涨跌家数 — the advance/decline count the market actually prints.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The A-share heatmap's breadth card counted its own TILES
(``site/heatmap.js`` ``computeSummary``), and the tile universe is
``data/china_search/members.parquet`` — Sina top-800 by market cap ∪ CSI 300 ∪
CSI 1000 ∪ config extras ≈ 1,510 names. So the card printed "▲154 / 1346▼" on a
board of ~5,200 names. The RATIO was sound (that panel covers 82% of A-share
market cap and ~73% of daily turnover), but 涨跌家数 is a whole-board count by
convention: a user cross-checking 东方财富 sees a denominator 3.4x larger and
reads ours as broken. This adapter supplies the real count so the card can stop
quoting a sample as if it were the board.

SCOPE — 沪深 only (Shanghai + Shenzhen), matching the convention most Chinese
breadth prints use. 北交所 (BSE, ~330 names, codes 4xx/8xx/9xx) is excluded: it
is thinly traded and would drag the reading around on very low volume. The
excluded board is named in the payload receipt, never silently dropped.

SOURCES (premium primary, keyless fallback — the house pattern from
``tushare_valuation`` ↔ ``china_a_val``):

  1. Tushare ``daily`` (120积分, inside the ¥500/5000积分 tier) — ONE
     ``trade_date=`` call returns every name that traded, with an exact session
     date. Gated on ``TUSHARE_TOKEN``; this is what nightly uses.
  2. Sina ``Market_Center.getHQNodeData`` node=hs_a, paged — keyless, ~69 pages.
     Slower and rate-limit-prone (hence the adapter's retry/backoff), but it
     works without a token and from a non-CN IP. Eastmoney's push2 whole-market
     spot (``ak.stock_zh_a_spot_em``) is NOT usable here — it resets the
     connection from a non-CN IP, the same failure that made this repo buy
     Tushare in the first place.

OUTPUT (``data/china_board_breadth/breadth.parquet``) — one row per SESSION,
indexed by the trade date (not the run date), so a same-session re-run overwrites
rather than duplicating, and the index itself is the freshness key the heatmap
builder gates on:

  n        — names that traded (the denominator; suspended names are excluded)
  adv      — 涨 count (% change > 0)
  dec      — 跌 count (% change < 0)
  flat     — 平 count (% change == 0)
  pct_up   — 100 * adv / n
  med_pct  — median % change across the board
  source   — 'tushare' | 'sina' (the receipt; which plane produced the row)

COUNT CONVENTION. 涨/跌/平 split on strict zero, which is what 东方财富 and
同花顺 print — deliberately NOT the ±0.05% dead-band the tile-derived fallback in
heatmap.js uses. The two differ by a handful of names out of ~5,200; matching the
convention matters more for a number whose whole purpose is cross-checkability.

DISPLAY-TIER. A count of what happened today — no forward claim, nothing scored.
