"""Keyless USAspending award/action collector for Government Revenue Foresight.

Official endpoints only:

* award discovery: ``POST /api/v2/search/spending_by_award/``
* award actions: ``POST /api/v2/transactions/``

The collector preserves three different clocks/tables instead of overwriting history:

* ``awards.parquet``: latest award identity/state with immutable ``first_seen_at``;
* ``award_actions.parquet``: append-only immutable actions, deduped by action id;
* ``award_snapshots.parquet``: one first-observed state per award per UTC day.

Every record carries ``known_at``, ``effective_at``, and an official source URL.  Entity
queries are curated fuzzy-name matches and therefore remain context, never signal truth.

      carrying the retrieval clock keeps the claim "the award's recipient of
      record as collected", which is a true statement about today.

    ==========================  ========  ======  =======  ======================

    Doubling the page therefore buys +92% of the bounded sample and two more
    genuinely exhausted issuers for zero extra requests and no measurable wall
    time — pagination cost here is per-request, not per-row.  Raising
    ``max_pages`` is the knob that is *not* affordable: the same window holds
    195,400 contract awards across these 21 issuers (``spending_by_award_count``,
    LMT alone 70,535), so exhaustion needs 1,965 pages at this page size, and
    deep pages are measurably slower than shallow ones (LMT pages 1-12 took
    100.2 s, 8.35 s/page).  That is hours against a ~67 min render budget, so
    ``source_exhausted`` stays unreachable and the awards rail keeps reporting
    ``truncated_by_safety_cap`` — a fully retrieved declared cap is a complete
    bounded sample, never corpus completion.
