"""Russell 2000 internal breadth + constituent close matrix.

Fourth BreadthAdapter subclass (after S&P 500 breadth.py, S&P 600
smallcap_breadth.py, and S&P MidCap 400 midcap_breadth.py). Expands the
dossier universe from the S&P 1500 to ∪ Russell 2000 (+~1,273 net-new names).

CONSTITUENT SOURCE — Finviz screener (idx_rut), NOT Wikipedia:
  The Russell 2000 has no free constituent table on Wikipedia. We source
  constituents from data/finviz_screener/idx_rut.json, which is written
  nightly in collect.py's us_scope block (the same Finviz fetch that powers
  the Nasdaq/Russell subsector desks). Row fields: ticker / company / sector.

STALE-JSON GUARD (never-shrink-the-ledger):
  If idx_rut.json is absent, older than 7 days, or has fewer than 1,600 rows
  (the sanity floor), we keep whatever constituents.parquet was last committed
  rather than shrinking the universe on a bad scrape. A ::warning is emitted.

CLOSES WINDOW — 2 years (vs sp600's ~3y, cost control):
  ~1,900 names × 2y in ≤250-ticker chunks. Chunks are capped at 250 to avoid
  Yahoo batch throttle (the sibling uses 80 from the shared yahoo.batch_size;
  we override to 250 here — still conservative for the larger universe).

FIRST-NIGHT BACKFILL NOTE:
  ~1,900 names × 2y of closes = significant download; the adapter time-boxes
  via the same per-batch time.sleep(1) pacing from the base class. If a run
  is interrupted mid-backfill the partial _closes_cache.parquet is persisted
  and the next run's incremental path (1mo tail) fills the gap. Self-healing.

Outputs (data/russell_breadth/):
  constituents.parquet — ticker-indexed: name, sector
  _closes_cache.parquet — wide date×ticker close matrix (gitignored; CI cache)
  breadth.parquet — breadth aggregates (free byproduct; nothing consumes yet)
