P1-R2 announcement-id integrity (2026-08-22, DSC:CHINA-VISITS-UNTYPED-
ANNOUNCEMENT-ID-DROP): announcementId is this plane's natural key, and a
falsy/NaN/whitespace key used to be dropped SILENTLY — drop_duplicates()
treats every row sharing "" as a duplicate of every other such row, so N
malformed rows collapsed into ONE with no counter, no log, no health note.
key_anomaly()/normalize_announcement_id()/partition_by_key_integrity() below
are the single typed predicate for "is this key malformed, and how";
write_filings() now excludes malformed rows as a TYPED, COUNTED exclusion
(module global LAST_KEY_INTEGRITY, folded into LAST_RUN_OUTCOME) instead of
letting them silently collapse or appending them keyless. collectors/
china_visits.py imports key_anomaly() from here rather than growing its own
opinion, so china_filings' write boundary and china_visits' candidate filter
can never silently diverge on what counts as malformed.

P1-R3A crash consistency at the source boundary (2026-08-22, Sol review of
PR #6242). Excluding a malformed row from the canonical store is only half
the contract — the observation still has to be REMEMBERED. Until P1-R3A the
only record of it between this module's write and china_visits' next run was
the process-local LAST_KEY_INTEGRITY handoff, so a hard kill in that window
(the asia lane runs under one) erased the observation from every durable
store at once. write_filings() now makes the exception DURABLE FIRST, via
china_visits.persist_boundary_exceptions() (_fence_coverage_exceptions()
below), and REFUSES its own canonical commit when that fails:

    durable coverage exception  ->  canonical filtered filing-store commit

The fence is INERT on the common path — it returns at its first line when
nothing was excluded, so a normal night neither imports china_visits nor
touches the ledger.

    testing that array raises ValueError ("ambiguous"); some object types
