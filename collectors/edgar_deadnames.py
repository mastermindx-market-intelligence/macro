"""Dead-name fundamentals recovery — the survivorship de-bias (Phase 1B of
research/INSTITUTIONAL_ROADMAP.md).

THE BIAS. `collectors/edgar.fetch_panel` already fetches every filer per fiscal
year from the frames API — including since-delisted ones — but DROPS them
(edgar.py:423) because the current `company_tickers.json` can't map a delisted
CIK back to its old ticker. Result, verified: of the 1,083 dead-only tickers in
`data/breadth/sp1500_pit_membership.parquet`, 0 carry any fundamentals. Every
factor IC / percentile in the stack is therefore computed on survivors only — a
textbook upward bias (the failures are exactly the names you most want in the
cross-section).

THE FIX, two independent halves.
  1. RESOLVE  dead ticker -> CIK (`resolve_dead_ciks`). The ticker<->CIK bridge
     lives only in SEC's `company_tickers.json` (www.sec.gov) or a vendor
     (Polygon). Both are IP-gated and unavailable from some build IPs, so this
     half is resumable and CACHED to data/edgar/dead_name_cik.json — resolve once
     where the sources are reachable (CI), consume the cache everywhere. A curated
     `_KNOWN_DEAD_CIK` seed of high-confidence M&A/renames resolves a verified
     core immediately AND guards against ticker-reuse mis-resolution (e.g. the old
     `ABX`/Barrick symbol now points at an unrelated filer).
     1b. The long tail (`resolve_via_fulltext`). company_tickers.json only carries
     names STILL trading under their symbol; the ~half that delisted/renamed fall
     out of it. The literal "formerNames crawl" the roadmap imagined is a dead end
     here: the SEC submissions doc carries `tickers` (CURRENT only — empty for every
     acquired name) and `formerNames` (former *names*, never former *tickers*), and
     the dead universe is bare tickers with no company name to match a former name
     against. What DOES work is EDGAR full-text search (efts.sec.gov — an SEC host
     distinct from the 403-prone www.sec.gov), which indexes the cover-page trading
     symbol of every annual report since 2001: a phrase search WINDOWED to the dead
     name's S&P membership era (the ticker-reuse guard) and gated by a doc-count
     DOMINANCE threshold returns the filer that actually traded under it, CONFIRMED
     against its data.sec.gov submissions doc. Honest, measured yield is partial —
     pre-2001 delistings are out of range and the conservative gate forgoes many
     real-but-ambiguous names because a wrong CIK is worse than none.
  2. PULL    fundamentals per resolved CIK (`build_dead_panel`) from the
     companyfacts API on data.sec.gov — keyless, reachable everywhere, and it
     carries the TRUE SEC `filed` timestamp. We stamp `asof_date = filed` (the
     date the report actually became public), NOT period_end and NOT the
     period_end+120d proxy the survivor panel uses. Stamping period_end would
     inject look-ahead; the real filed date is strictly leak-free.

Output `data/edgar/dead_name_panel.parquet` is schema-identical to
`fundamentals_panel.parquet` so `merged_panel()` simply concatenates the two.
`coverage()` writes the honest `dead_name_coverage` ratio every consumer should
display. KEYLESS · resumable · drip-capped (companyfacts is 3.5-7.5 MB/filer).

# Half 1b — EDGAR full-text crawl for the still-`unresolved` long tail
#
# WHY NOT a literal formerNames reverse-index. The SEC submissions doc
# (data.sec.gov/submissions/CIK*.json) carries `tickers` (CURRENT only — verified
# empty for every acquired/delisted name: ATVI/AET/FLIR all return []) and
# `formerNames` (former *names*, never former *tickers*). The dead universe is bare
# tickers with NO company name (sp1500_pit_membership has ticker/start/end only),
# so there is nothing to match a former *name* against and no former-*ticker* field
# to match a ticker against — a blind enumerate-and-reverse-index crawl cannot
# bridge a bare dead ticker.
#
# WHAT WORKS. EDGAR full-text search (efts.sec.gov) indexes the cover-page trading
# symbol of every 10-K/20-F/40-F since 2001. A phrase search for the dead ticker,
# WINDOWED to that ticker's S&P membership era (a later reuse of the symbol files in
# a different era → excluded) and gated by a doc-count DOMINANCE threshold (a wrong
# CIK is worse than none), surfaces the filer that actually traded under it as the
# dominant entity bucket. Each hit is CONFIRMED against its data.sec.gov submissions
# doc — the "pull the submissions doc" step — which rejects (i) a still-listed entity
# under a DIFFERENT symbol (APPS→'Cyber Apps World'), (ii) an entity still filing
# years past the index exit, and (iii) an acquired filer whose name does not
# corroborate the symbol as an in-order subsequence (ANDV is not a subsequence of
# 'American National Insurance'), and records `formerNames` for the audit trail.
# Tagged method="edgar_fts".
#
# Honest yield. Names still listed under their symbol are already resolved by
# company_tickers.json and never reach this leg; the net-new population is the
# acquired/renamed tail, of which a measured ~1-in-5 clears the conservative
# dominance+confirmation gate. Pre-2001 delistings (~144 names) are out of EDGAR FTS
# range; `Q`-suffix bankruptcy symbols (LEHMQ…) filed under the pre-bankruptcy
# symbol and miss. Partial by design — every accept is logged with its evidence and
# broken out by method so a consumer can exclude it for a maximally-pure panel.

        Echo Global Logistics was acquired in 2021, EchoStar holds the symbol now).
        The old interval is genuinely closed, so this one IS dead-name work.

         comparative, each tagged with the *filing's* `fy` (not the period's) — so
         keying on `e["fy"]` grabs prior-year comparatives (ATVI's FY2009 10-K
         carries 2007/2008 rows all tagged fy=2009). We key by the reporting
         PERIOD (`end`) and keep the EARLIEST-filed entry (the value first
         knowable, stamped with its real filed date → leak-free `asof`).
      2. 52/53-week filers (Cerner, etc.) end a fiscal year on the Saturday near
         Dec 31, so the period end can fall in an ADJACENT calendar year and two
         fiscal years can share a calendar year — `year(end)` then mislabels and
         collides. We therefore label the fiscal year from the SEC `CY{year}`
         FRAME tag (the same canonical label the survivor frames panel uses),
         falling back to the entry's `fy` field, then to `year(end)`.
