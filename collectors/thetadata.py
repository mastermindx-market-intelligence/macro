"""collectors/thetadata.py — thin client for the local ThetaData Terminal v3 REST API.

ThetaData works via a local Java process ("Theta Terminal") that exposes a REST API on
localhost.  Our job is purely to call that API and return normalized DataFrames; all option
pricing, signing, and analytics live in engine/.

CONTRACT (same spirit as collectors/databento_tbbo.py and collectors/massive_flatfiles.py)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
INERT when the terminal is unreachable:
  • Terminal unreachable / non-200 / malformed response → log one WARNING, return None or an
    empty DataFrame.  NEVER raise into a build.
  • Short connect timeout (CONNECT_TIMEOUT = 3s) for the reachability check.
  • Generous read timeout (READ_TIMEOUT_BETWEEN_BYTES = 90s) between bytes on streaming reads.
    This is the per-read-call timeout, not the total response time.  A stalled stream (zero
    bytes flowing for >90s) raises ReadTimeout → caught as _StreamTruncated → returns None.

STALL FIX (2026-07-05):
  Live diagnosis showed that bulk "range" requests spanning months hang indefinitely: the
  terminal assembles old data server-side and starves the stream (32,768 bytes then silence).
  Short windows (≤7 calendar days) with wildcard expiration work reliably (HTTP 200, data
  flowing).  The fix: iterate ≤7-day windows with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=6) so
  backfill concurrency saturates the terminal's 8-concurrent ceiling with headroom.

  Per-window retry: on stall/truncation, retry up to 2 more times with 5s/15s backoff.
  If a window still fails after retries → WHOLE call returns None (no partial DataFrame).
  Deterministic ordering: windows are submitted in chronological order; results sorted by
  window key after gather.

API topology (measured live 2026-07-04 against ThetaTerminal v3 20260702:79baa88):
  Base URL: http://127.0.0.1:25503  (override via THETA_TERMINAL_URL env)
  Version:  v3 (v2 paths return HTTP 410 Gone — dead)
  Account:  Options: PROFESSIONAL; Max concurrent requests: 8
  Runs on:  the same Mac as the nightly collectors; started by scripts/run_theta_terminal.sh

Concurrency ceiling:
  The terminal enforces a hard ceiling of 8 concurrent requests.  WINDOW_WORKERS = 6 leaves
  2 slots of headroom for other concurrent operations.

Strike format (v3, measured live):
  v3 uses DOLLAR FLOATS directly (e.g., 170.000 = $170.00).  The v2 1/10th-cent integer
  convention (strike / 1000 = dollars) is DEAD.  No divisor is applied; strikes are used
  as-is from the API response.
  → STRIKE_DIVISOR = 1.0  (identity; kept for backward-compat constant reference only).
  Source: measured from /v3/option/history/eod response (e.g., "SPY","2026-07-17",723.000).

Param renames (v2 → v3, verified live):
  root      → symbol
  exp       → expiration   (YYYYMMDD integer, date string "YYYY-MM-DD", or "*" wildcard)
  strike    → strike       (DOLLAR FLOAT, e.g., "170.000")
  right     → right        (requests: "call"/"put"; responses: "CALL"/"PUT")
  use_csv   → format       (format=csv|json|ndjson|html)

Response format: CSV by default (format=csv).  Streaming chunked response; no pagination.

Wildcard-expiration rule (endpoint-specific, measured live 2026-07-04):
  /history/eod ACCEPTS multi-day wildcard (expiration="*") — but ONLY for SHORT windows
  (≤7 calendar days; measured reliable).  Long ranges stall the stream server-side.
  /history/greeks/eod REJECTS multi-day wildcard (HTTP 400: "When expiration=*, you must
  request data a day-at-a-time").  bulk_greeks keeps the day-by-day loop with concurrency.

Endpoints implemented (measured live 2026-07-04):
  GET /v3/option/list/symbols              → reachable() probe
  GET /v3/option/history/eod              → bulk_eod()
  GET /v3/option/history/open_interest    → bulk_open_interest()
  GET /v3/option/history/greeks/eod       → bulk_greeks() (see GREEKS NOTE below)
  GET /v3/option/history/trade_quote      → bulk_trade_quote() (1 right, any date range)
                                          → bulk_trade_quote_day() (both legs, 1 day)
                                          → trade_quote() (single-contract, any range)

Snapshot endpoints (measured live 2026-07-16 — U-CHAIN lane, research/THETADATA_PROBE.md):
  GET /v3/option/snapshot/greeks/first_order   → snapshot_greeks(root, order="first")
  GET /v3/option/snapshot/greeks/second_order  → snapshot_greeks(root, order="second")
  GET /v3/option/snapshot/open_interest        → snapshot_open_interest(root)
  Unlike the history greeks endpoints, snapshots ACCEPT expiration=* AND strike=*:
  one request returns the full live chain (SPY: 14,065 rows in 0.96s first-order,
  0.83s second-order, 0.21s OI).  Market closed → last-known close-ish values.

GREEKS NOTE (v3 doc-vs-live finding, measured 2026-07-04):
  The correct endpoint for EOD greeks is /v3/option/history/greeks/eod (NOT /greeks/all).
  /greeks/eod returns one row per contract per day with all greek orders, OHLCV, bid/ask,
  and IV — a buffered response suitable for bulk use.
  /greeks/all streams 1-second snapshots; multi-day requests require interval >= 1 minute,
  but ALL interval values are rejected with "Invalid interval: X" for this endpoint.
  greeks/eod supports wildcard expiration (expiration="*") for ONE day at a time (same rule
  as bulk_eod).  Multi-day wildcard → iterate day-by-day in this module.

CSV headers (verbatim from live API, 2026-07-04):
  EOD:  symbol,expiration,strike,right,created,last_trade,open,high,low,close,
         volume,count,bid_size,bid_exchange,bid,bid_condition,ask_size,ask_exchange,

CSV headers (verbatim from live API, 2026-07-16 — snapshot endpoints):
  snapshot greeks/first_order:  symbol,expiration,strike,right,timestamp,bid,ask,
               delta,theta,vega,rho,epsilon,lambda,implied_vol,iv_error,
               underlying_timestamp,underlying_price

               gamma,vanna,charm,vomma,veta,implied_vol,iv_error,
               underlying_timestamp,underlying_price
  snapshot open_interest: timestamp,symbol,expiration,strike,right,open_interest
               (NOTE: timestamp is the FIRST column here, unlike the greeks
               snapshots — normalization is by column name, never by position)

OI update timing (confirmed from v2 docs, still applies in v3):
  OPRA reports OI once per day at ~06:30 ET; the value represents end-of-previous-day
  positions.  OI[t] from OPRA = positions as of EOD t-1.  Use OI[t-1] in any day-t
  signal; same-day OI is a data leak.

History depth (measured 2026-07-04, AAPL binary probe):
  Data exists from 2012-06-01 (first confirmed day with data).  2012-01-01 through
  2012-05-31 have NO data.  DEFAULT_START in backfill: 20120601.

SPXW (measured 2026-07-04):
  SPXW is confirmed as a valid distinct root in /v3/option/list/symbols.
  Add to INDEX_ROOTS alongside SPX for PM-settled weekly coverage.

AMBIGUITIES RESOLVED (as of 2026-07-04 probe):
  A1 (Bulk OI): v3 has /v3/option/history/open_interest with wildcard — CONFIRMED.
  A2 (SPXW): CONFIRMED as distinct root.
  A3 (2nd-order Greeks): greeks/eod returns all orders in one response — CONFIRMED.
  A4 (3rd-order Greeks): Same; speed/zomma/color/ultima all in greeks/eod response.
  A5 (Greeks layout): Measured — see CSV header above (all greek orders + OHLCV).
  A6 (IV endpoint): greeks/eod includes implied_vol column — no separate IV endpoint needed.
  A7 (exp=* endpoint-specific): /history/eod ACCEPTS short wildcard windows (≤7d measured);
     long ranges stall (stall fix: windowed pulls). /history/greeks/eod REJECTS multi-day
     wildcard (HTTP 400) — keeps day-by-day loop.
  A8 (History depth): Measured — starts 2012-06-01 (NOT 2013-01-02 as initially guessed).
  A9 (Password in argv): v3 accepts --api-key flag OR THETADATA_API_KEY env var.
     Launcher uses the env var (2026-07-16): --api-key put the key in plaintext argv,
     readable by any local process via `ps`.

    Strike: passed as DOLLAR FLOAT (no conversion needed in v3).
    right: normalized to "call"/"put" for requests; response carries "CALL"/"PUT".

    This is the gold-standard source for quote-rule signing calibration:
    every trade is stamped with the NBBO at execution, enabling Lee-Ready signing.

    Returns the legacy columns (date, trade_timestamp, quote_timestamp, price,
    size, bid, ask, exchange, strike, right, root) plus the remaining paid
    source provenance additively: expiration, exact sequence, condition and
    ext_condition1..4, bid/ask sizes, exchanges, and conditions.  Source code
    fields stay raw strings; exact integer fields use nullable Int64.  Returns
    None if terminal is unreachable.

    right is explicitly "call" or "put". Wildcard right= returns HTTP 400.
    Two calls per root-day (one per right) cover the entire chain.

    This is the T2a aggregate-then-discard path. Raw rows should be discarded
    by the caller after aggregation.

    Returns a DataFrame with the same full paid source provenance as
    trade_quote() EXCEPT that strike is not fixed (it varies per contract in
    the response). The 'strike' column is parsed from the response CSV (each
    row has its own strike). Exact integer fields use nullable Int64; conditions
    and exchanges remain raw source strings. The 'sequence' column is included
    for dedup / watermark use.

    Optional time-of-day filtering (v3 format "HH:MM:SS.mmm" ET):
      start_time : "HH:MM:SS", "HH:MM:SS.mmm", "HH:MM", or ms-of-day int.
                   If provided, only trades at or after this time are returned.
      end_time   : same formats.  If provided, only trades at or before this
                   time are returned.
    Behavior is identical to the no-params call when both are None (additive).

    ⚠ Wildcard + time filter (measured 2026-07-31, terminal build 202607231):
      expiration=* combined with start_time/end_time returns HTTP 200 with ZERO
      rows — silently empty, not an error — while the same window with an
      explicit expiration returns the correct subset. A windowed wildcard call
      is therefore routed through the per-expiration path unconditionally (any
      date), never sent as a wildcard request.

    near_dte_cap_days:
      Only used on the per-expiration path (current-day wildcard rejection, or
      any windowed pull per the guard above).
      If set, limits per-expiration pulls to expirations where
      exp_date <= target_date + timedelta(days=near_dte_cap_days).
      None means no cap (all unexpired expirations are fetched).

    expiration:
      Explicit expiration (YYYYMMDD int / ISO str / date) to fetch a single
      expiration instead of the whole chain. Bypasses both the current-day
      wildcard rejection and the windowed-wildcard guard; used by the poller's
      delta_mode probe. Default "*" (full chain).

    Returns None on terminal error; empty DataFrame if no trades exist.
