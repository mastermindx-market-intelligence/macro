"""SEC EDGAR full-text search → guidance-change language hits (T3 of the Thematic
Foresight Desk; research/THEMATIC_FORESIGHT_DESK.md + research/THEMATIC_FORESIGHT_INSTITUTIONAL_UPGRADE.md).

WHY (the T3 leg). T3 is the *guidance-gap* tier — the days-to-one-quarter window where
management pre-signals versus the bar the market set. The clean version needs a paywalled
expectation series (Visible Alpha / Estimize whisper) for the numeric gap, but the
LANGUAGE side is fully free: a company front-running its own print files an 8-K that
literally says "raising our guidance" / "lowering our outlook". That sentence hits the
wire FIRST; the consensus estimate revision (T4) is the lagged response over the following
days-to-weeks — so a guidance-language event mechanically LEADS T4 breadth (Hsu et al.,
bundled-guidance 8-Ks pull faster, larger revisions).

This collector mirrors collectors/edgar_fts.py exactly (keyless efts.sec.gov, UA header,
<10 req/s, drip + cached, abort-on-first-failure) but sweeps two DIRECTIONAL lexicons over
**8-K only** (where pre-announcements live) and tags each hit raise/cut. We keep only hits
whose ticker is in the curated theme universe (config `themes:`) and store them so
engine/guidance_gap.py can roll a per-theme RAISE/CUT tilt band up from the filers.

Writes data/edgar/guidance_hits.parquet (phrase, direction, form, file_date, cik, ticker,
display_name), deduped by document id + phrase. Network failure is non-fatal — the engine's
T3 leg simply stays None (the cascade runs unchanged on T1×T2×T4).

LIMITS (honest). Phrase matching has no sentence-level negation handling ("not raising
guidance" would match); the ≥2-distinct-filer guard in engine/guidance_gap.py mitigates a
single false positive, and the LLM extractor layer (blueprint §5) is where negation gets
resolved. This is a coarse directional BAND, never a numeric beat/miss.
