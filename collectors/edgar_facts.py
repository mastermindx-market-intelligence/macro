"""SEC EDGAR companyfacts → multi-year financial statements per stock (Phase 2 of
research/STOCK_FUNDAMENTALS_PLAN.md).

The frames API (collectors/edgar.py) gives ONE latest-FY cross-section. To draw the
analyzer's Financials TRENDS (revenue/margins/EPS/FCF over ~5 years) and the health
scores (Piotroski F, Altman Z), we need per-filer HISTORY — that's the companyfacts
API: data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/companyfacts/CIK{10}.json returns a filer's full XBRL
history in one keyless call. We pull a small concept set, keep the last ~5 fiscal
years, and write a slim LONG-format table data/edgar/statements.parquet
(one row per ticker-fiscal-year). engine/stock_fundamentals consumes it.

KEYLESS but PAYLOAD-bound (3.5-7.5 MB/filer) — so this is a WEEKLY, resumable,
capped drip (skip filers fetched within refresh_days), never a per-build fetch.
Honest caveats (shown on the page): values are lagged to the filing date; some
concepts are sparse on smaller filers (custom tags) — those years simply omit them.

Each row carries `period_end` (the winning filing's TRUE fiscal period-end date)
so consumers can gate not-yet-filed fiscal rows point-in-time (availability ≈
period_end + reporting-lag). Rows written before this column existed have
period_end=NaN until their next drip re-fetch re-stamps it (consumers keep
un-stamped rows ungated — display-only, self-heals within the ~monthly refresh).

BUG FIX NOTES (LT-1a, 2026-07-06):
  shares: us-gaap:CommonStockSharesOutstanding lives in the "shares" XBRL unit, NOT
    "USD". The BALANCE loop previously called _concept() with the default unit="USD",
    returning an empty dict → all shares values were None. Fixed by extracting shares
    separately with unit="shares", instant=True.  dei:EntityCommonStockSharesOutstanding
    was considered as fallback but is only in the dei namespace (not us-gaap) and
    contains cover-page counts (post-period-end), so it was NOT added.
    WeightedAverageNumberOfDilutedSharesOutstanding is a FLOW concept (per-period
    average) and should not mix with the point-in-time balance sheet count.
  future-FY guard: rows whose period_end is in the future relative to run date are
    dropped at the end of _statements_for(). This is the canonical PIT gate — the fy
    XBRL field alone is unreliable (e.g. STX encodes their fiscal year count as fy=2027
    when the actual period ends in June 2025). period_end (the 'end' date from the
    winning filing entry) is the correct signal.
