"""China A-share per-name daily OHLC via yfinance + guarded Tencent tail repair.

The real HIGH/LOW feed the multi-country MACD-RSI x StochRSI confluence + buy-filter
need — versus the close+volume the index/ETF store ``data/china/`` keeps. Universe =
the committed A-share SEARCH universe (``data/china_search/closes.parquet``, ~1.5k
names) the China library already analyzes, unioned with a small config ``seed``
(committed up front; the rest backfills nightly — ``store.upsert`` is incremental).
Store mirrors ``data/stocks/*.parquet``: one parquet per ticker at
``data/china_stocks/<CODE>.SS|.SZ.parquet``.

Yahoo remains the canonical primary/deep-history source.  Tencent is a recent-tail
repair source only: after the primary pull, missing or market-stale names are checked
against Tencent qfq daily bars and may be extended only when the overlapping adjusted
close basis agrees.  Persistence still flows through this adapter's one existing
``china_stocks`` store; no second data plane is created.  Both source planes are capped
at the last completed Shanghai session before persistence, so an operator-triggered
repair while the market is open cannot turn an intraday partial row into daily truth.
See ``research/signal_engine/MULTICOUNTRY_DATA.md`` and
``research/china_native_data/SOURCE_CATALOG_MARKET.md``.
