"""Massive.com whole-market daily OHLCV store — derived per-ticker parquets.

The massive.com flat-file entitlement includes us_stocks_sip/day_aggs_v1/ — a
ROLLING ~5-year→present window of whole-market daily bars (probe-verified
2026-07-03: earliest available day 2021-07-06 = first trading day on/after
today−5y; days before the floor 403).  Today fetch_aggs() in massive_flatfiles.py
fetches individual days but NEVER persists the stock_day product into a durable
store: the transient download cache (data/massive_flat/) holds universe-filtered
frames keyed by (date, underlyings_hash) and is gitignored.

This module builds and maintains a DERIVED per-ticker store:
  data/massive_stock_day/<TICKER>.parquet  — all-uppercase vendor tickers (legacy path)
  data/massive_stock_day/__case_v1/<hex>.parquet — mixed-case vendor tickers
  (both append-only, index=date at UTC midnight; the second path is APFS-casefold-safe)
  data/massive_stock_day/_manifest.json   — freshness anchor (committed; rest gitignored)

R2 IS THE CANONICAL HOME (2026-07-29).  The store lives under the Cloudflare R2 key
prefix `massive_stock_day/` (~617 MB, ~20k parquets); a git checkout holds only the
two committed JSON sidecars.  The nightly collect job therefore runs the whole round
trip in ONE place: scripts/fetch_r2 --dirs massive_stock_day RESTORES the store,
run_incremental() UPSERTS the new trading days on top of it, and scripts/publish_r2
--dirs massive_stock_day publishes the delta back — that publish GATED on the
restore's outcome so a partial tree can never overwrite the deep copy (publish_r2
independently refuses data-dir trees under ~100 files).  The R2 _manifest.json is the
audit_r2 freshness anchor, and a STRICT one as of 2026-07-29: a dead feed, a failed
restore, or a skipped publish turns the engine job red within 26h.

URGENCY / BACKFILL DESIGN
--------------------------
Each month of delay permanently loses a month of whole-market history because the
entitlement is a ROLLING window (earliest days age out once the window moves forward).
The backfill loop therefore processes days in EARLIEST-FIRST order, stopping only on
S3 errors or an explicit date ceiling.

Each raw daily CSV (~12,000 rows, ~0.8 MB compressed) is:
1. Downloaded via fetch_aggs() (the existing S3 reader).
2. Pivoted to per-ticker rows and APPENDED (upsert by date) to each ticker's parquet.

Tickers without a parquet file yet get one created.  Re-runs are idempotent: a day
already recorded as processed is skipped.

RESUME STATE — data/massive_stock_day/_backfill_state.json (COMMITTED)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
v2 schema: {"version": 2, "processed_days": [ISO date, ...], "last_captured_date": ISO}

`processed_days` is the AUTHORITATIVE per-day coverage record: every weekday that was
either fetched-and-written or confirmed empty upstream (holiday) is listed.  Resume /
incremental target selection is the SET DIFFERENCE trading_days(window) − processed —
never a scalar high-water mark.

WHY: the v1 state was a single `last_captured_date`, monotonically clobbered by ANY
capture.  On 2026-07-03 the W0.6 smoke test (3 most-recent days) left the committed
state at 2026-06-30 while only 2025-01-02→(mid-backfill) existed on disk — a resumed
backfill would have restarted at 2026-07-01 and PERMANENTLY skipped
2026-03-13→2026-06-30, with the manifest still claiming freshness (this is exactly
the 110-day "coverage gap" the Options-Alpha W1.1 agent tripped over).  A v1 state
file is therefore treated as untrustworthy and migrated by scanning the actual
parquets (union of dates) once.

A day whose fetch ERRORS (S3 exception / entitlement 403) is NOT recorded — it is
retried on the next run.  Days that age out below the rolling floor keep 403ing and
keep being skipped; they never enter processed_days and sit below min(processed), so
the incremental window never widens onto them.

NIGHTLY INCREMENTAL
-------------------
run_incremental() computes the missing trading days over the FULL window
[min(processed_days) … latest_available()] — so an interior hole (a failed day, a
killed run) SELF-HEALS on the next nightly pass instead of hiding behind the tip.
Capped at `max_days` per run (default 40) so a large discovered hole chips away
across nights without blowing the collect lane's time budget; the remainder is
logged loudly and the audit (scripts/audit_massive_store.py) trips on the hole.

Targets are ordered TIP-FIRST (2026-07-29): days above the high-water mark lead,
interior-hole days follow, both ascending.  Every consumer rides the tip, and a
capped run must never spend all 40 slots on a multi-week hole while today's bar goes
unfetched — earliest-first WITHIN each half keeps the aging-out rescue property for
the hole itself.

STORE CONTRACT
--------------
Schema per-ticker parquet:
  index: date (datetime64[ns], UTC midnight, named "date")
  columns: open, high, low, close (float64), volume (int64), transactions (int64)
  sorted ascending by date
  dedup: latest write wins on a date tie (idempotent)

Ordering: a ticker with no data (404 / 0-volume bar) on a given date simply has no
row for that date; per-TICKER gaps are legitimate (halted names, ETF launches).
Whole-STORE day gaps are NOT legitimate — that is what processed_days + the
massive_store audit guard.

GIT / R2 BOUNDARY
-----------------
data/massive_stock_day/{*.parquet,__case_v1/*.parquet}
                                  → gitignored (multi-GB total), R2-canonical
data/massive_stock_day/_manifest.json → COMMITTED (freshness anchor for audit_r2)
data/massive_stock_day/_backfill_state.json → COMMITTED (resume state, v2)

A runner checkout holds the parquets only TRANSIENTLY — between the collect job's
restore and its publish-back.  _store_absent() fences everything else: when the local
tree carries fewer than _MIN_STORE_FILES parquets while the committed state CLAIMS
coverage, backfill()/run_incremental() refuse BEFORE any network call or state write.
Running there would fetch days into a tree the next actions/checkout wipes and record
them in the state file that DOES get committed — permanent silent loss, the
2026-07-03 v1-state incident one layer down.  Bootstrap is therefore always "restore
from R2", never "start from scratch".

The manifest is written by _write_manifest() after every successful batch and now
carries `coverage` (derived from processed_days) plus an independent `anchor` block
read straight from the SPY parquet — so a manifest whose claims diverge from the
actual store is detectable (scripts/audit_massive_store.py checks exactly that).

CREDENTIALS
-----------
Uses MASSIVE_S3_* credentials (same as collectors/massive_flatfiles.py), NOT R2_* —
the store is HOSTED on R2 (R2_* creds drive the restore/publish legs) but DOWNLOADED
from Massive S3.  The four MASSIVE_S3_* secrets are wired into the collect job's
"run collectors" step env as of 2026-07-29.  They were only ever set on the ENGINE
job's builder step before that, so run_incremental() returned {"blocked": "no_creds"}
every night from 2026-07-04 to 2026-07-29 — 21 consecutive breaker increments, each
swallowed by the collect lane's graceful degradation under a green run.  See
scripts/publish_r2.py for the R2 upload path.
