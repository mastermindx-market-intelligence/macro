"""同花顺 (Tonghuashun / 10jqka) concept-board (概念板块) membership fetcher.

THS curates ~370 thematic "concept boards" (concepts like 白酒/baijiu, 人形机器人/humanoid
robots, 固态电池/solid-state battery …) and the A-share members of each. This module pulls the
theme→members map straight from q.10jqka.com.cn so the China thematic-baskets desk can mirror
THS's themes and constituents (see scripts/seed_china_ths_baskets.py).

WHY THIS EXISTS (akshare can't do it any more): akshare exposes the THS concept *names*
(`stock_board_concept_name_ths`) but its members function (`stock_board_concept_cons_ths`) was
removed. The member table is still served on the plain detail page; this module pages through it.

ACCESS NOTES (verified from a non-China datacentre IP, 2026-06):
  • Theme list — akshare `stock_board_concept_name_ths()` (cached to disk here; ~370 names+codes).
  • Members  — page `https://q.10jqka.com.cn/gn/detail/order/desc/page/{N}/ajax/1/code/{code}/`
               (10 rows/page). The `/field/199112/` URL variant 403s from outside China; the
               clean variant above returns 200. An anti-scrape `v` cookie (generated from THS's
               own ths.js via py_mini_racer, exactly as akshare does) is required.
  • Fragile  — rapid sequential requests draw SSL drops / 403s, so every fetch retries with
               backoff and paces between pages; a failed theme is skipped (logged), never fatal.

Output: a dated raw snapshot data/baskets_china_ths/snapshots/<YYYY-MM-DD>.json
        ({theme_name: [{"ticker": "600519.SS", "name": "贵州茅台"}, …]}, full membership incl.
        names outside our price universe — the seed step filters). Re-runnable; the seed step
        accumulates point-in-time `added`/`removed` history by diffing snapshots over time.
