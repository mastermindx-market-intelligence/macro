# Preventive hardening: redact secrets from retried-request log lines AND from
# FetchResult.error (which is serialized into the TRACKED data/run_status.json —
# see run_adapter below). `requests`' default HTTPError/ConnectionError text
# embeds the FULL request URL — query string and all — via `raise_for_status()`
# and friends, so a bare `str(exc)` interpolation carries any credential value
# straight into a log line or a committed file, even one that otherwise takes
# care to log a query-stripped URL separately.
#
# Widened per the AD-1C0 adversarial review (2026-08-19, two rounds) — the
# enumerated leak shapes a single "name=value" regex missed: a quoted JSON
# body value ("apiKey":"…" AND 'apiKey':'…', either quote style — N4(i)), a
# header-name credential repr (X-API-Key / Api-Key / X-Auth-Token — N4(ii)),
# an `Authorization: Bearer …` header repr, a URL-encoded assignment
# (name%3Dvalue), a bare "name value" mention with no `=` at all, a
# basic-auth netloc (://user:pass@ — N4(iii)), and a vendor secret embedded as
# a URL PATH SEGMENT with no adjacent keyword at all (Stripe-style
# sk_live_…/pk_test_… prefixes). Several passes, most specific first; each is
# independently idempotent so their order does not matter for correctness,
# only for keeping the output readable.

# DOCUMENTED RESIDUAL (N4): an OPAQUE path-token secret with NEITHER a
# recognizable vendor prefix (sk_/pk_) NOR any adjacent credential keyword —

# with no "key=" or "/api-key/" context at all — cannot be redacted here
# without a rule general enough to mangle ordinary URL path segments (release
# tags, hashes, slugs...) that are not secrets. The mitigation is upstream:
# collectors never embed the API key in a URL PATH (only as a query param,
# which the passes below and _QUERY_TAIL_RE's catch-all both cover), so this
