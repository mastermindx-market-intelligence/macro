"""Resumable, provenance-first TuShare full-A daily/security spine.

This ``context_only`` foundation builds a lifecycle-aware SH/SZ/BJ master,
canonical/old-BSE aliases, an SSE=SZSE market-session clock, post-2016 exact-day
``bak_basic`` universe witnesses, effective-dated names, and daily quote/limit/
suspension/ST partitions.  It does not score signals or claim alpha.

TuShare licensing/compliance is ``CHAIRMAN_VERIFIED_PRIVATE / SATISFIED``
(``DEC:CNLI-TUSHARE-COMPLIANCE-IS-CHAIRMAN-VERIFIED-PRIVATE``).  The controlling
agreement and its supporting evidence are confidential and outside coding/agent
scope under NDA/privacy constraints: no runtime path, CLI flag, manifest field,
or test in this repository may request, inspect, persist, hash, quote, or gate on
them.  What this module does enforce is technical -- the token is read only
through ``collectors.tushare_client`` and is never accepted, persisted, hashed, or
logged here, and every response must bind to its exact request.

The default store is private and outside the repository:
``~/.local/share/macro-dashboard/china_tushare_spine`` (override only with
``CN_TUSHARE_SPINE_STORE`` or ``--store``).  Its principal layout is::

    reference/current_generation.json
    reference/generations/<generation>/
        source_{bse_mapping,stock_basic,fund_basic}/...
        {security_master,identity_aliases,instrument_classification}.parquet
    reference/{trade_calendar/year=YYYY,market_sessions}.parquet
    bak_basic/year=YYYY/month=MM/part.parquet
    name_history/year=YYYY.parquet
    {daily,daily_basic,stk_limit,suspend_d,stock_st}/year=YYYY/month=MM/part.parquet
    source_row_classification/{known_excluded,quarantined_unknown}/...
    range_campaigns/<campaign-id>/{plan,terminal_index,campaign_receipt}...
    source_range_shards/{daily,daily_basic,stk_limit}/<campaign-id>/...
    receipts/requests/<endpoint>/range:<leaf-id>/<attempt-id>.json
    event_daily/year=YYYY/month=MM/part.parquet
    coverage/daily_security_coverage.parquet
    collection_state.json
    completeness_manifest.json

Every response must have the exact requested schema and belong to the exact
exchange/status/date/ticker request.  Each source unit satisfies
``source = landed_A + independently_known_out_of_scope + quarantined_unknown``;
unknown rows, name orphans, absent/tampered request or classification receipts, or
an uncovered ticker-range campaign block completeness.  Capped whole-market
responses are discarded as non-authoritative probes before deterministic
ticker-by-date-range recovery.  Range leaves split below the endpoint cap,
transpose back to exact-day partitions, and keep each attempt immutable.  The
operational gate nevertheless remains false pending live canary, throughput, and
correctness evidence.

``daily`` is unadjusted nominal price authority and retains zero-volume rows with
``positive_volume = volume_lots > 0``.  A traded/listing-session claim must filter
that flag.  ``stk_limit`` is exact legal-band authority.  Canonical event prices
are integer CNY cents; OHLC must remain inside published bounds and touch/seal
flags use integer equality.  The Decimal half-up calculator is validator-only.

Usage (no implicit full-history collection)::

    python -m collectors.china_tushare_spine --start 20110101 --end 20260807 \
        --max-requests 50
    python -m collectors.china_tushare_spine --start 20110101 --end 20260807 \
        --dry-run

The default request cap is intentionally small.  Re-running resumes incomplete
units.  ``--allow-bulk`` is required above the safety ceiling or for unlimited
collection.  ``BULK_HISTORICAL_BACKFILL_READY`` is deliberately false until a
separately reviewed wave proves the range implementation against live data with
canary, throughput, and correctness evidence.  It is a technical readiness gate
and must never be read, restored, or re-titled as a licensing gate.

Because that gate waits on canary evidence, the canary itself must be runnable
first: ``--canary`` performs real bounded collection while the gate is still
false, capped at ``CANARY_MAX_REQUESTS`` requests over ``CANARY_MAX_RANGE_DAYS``
calendar days, never with ``--allow-bulk``, and refusing rather than starting the
unproven ticker-range campaign if a documented row cap fires.  The three modes
are therefore ``--dry-run`` (network-free plan), ``--canary`` (real, hard-bounded)
and the default bulk/backfill path (still gated).

# which TuShare `trade_cal` supplies a JOINTLY complete SSE+SZSE calendar; it is
# frozen in source and is never selected at runtime, so two runs over the same
# store can never disagree about which date owns which ordinal.
#
# 1992-01-01 was established by an outcome-blind source census over the landed
# calendar partitions (`scripts/research/cn_limit_calendar_epoch_census.py`):
# SSE and SZSE each return 366 of 366 unique civil dates for 1992, every year
# 1992..2023 is jointly complete with zero open/closed parity mismatches, and
# both exchanges show zero `pretrade_date` chain violations and zero missing
# civil dates.  1991 fails only because TuShare returns 182 of 365 days for SZSE.
#
# That 182-day shortfall is SOURCE-HISTORY TRUNCATION, not evidence that the
# missing civil dates fell outside the trading system.  Pre-epoch history is
# therefore typed `PRE_EPOCH_SOURCE_UNSUPPORTED`: it is never imputed as closed,
# never assigned an ordinal, and SSE history is never borrowed as exact SZSE
# history.  Bump the definition string, never mutate the date in place, if a
# future authority moves the epoch — artifacts stamped under different
