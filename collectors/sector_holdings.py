    re-pull rewrote the entire 1994-2026 file onto the successor's basis plus live

    the annotation law and tests/test_gh_annotation_line_start.py). _fetch_universe's

    name still on disk, so without this the store-tip audit's stale_live flag is the
    only thing that would ever notice — one whole night later, and without the reason.

    The union/retained SPLIT is the actionable part, and it is the one thing the yahoo
    lane has no need of. A ticker in TODAY's top-N union that returns nothing is a live
    provider failure against a name the desk is actively holding. A RETAINED ticker
    (still on disk, already out of the union) that returns nothing is the
    delisted-or-renamed candidate set — #4616's law is that delisted is not stale, and
    the exit path for those names is the dead-name registry / the #4622 symbol
    resolution protocol (a rename is a KEY MIGRATION), never an in-place refetch.
    Naming the two apart is what lets the next reader route them correctly instead of
