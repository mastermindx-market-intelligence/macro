"""One-shot honest cross-fill of the 2026-07-30 CBOE gex hole from the polygon archive.

WHAT WAS LOST
    On 2026-07-30 the CBOE CDN held a continuous HTTP 429 on the delayed_quotes chain
    endpoint for ≥3 minutes (23:42:32Z→23:45:33Z+, run 30590845976), outlasting both
    the 3/6/12s per-request ladder and that night's single 60s cooldown. Six series
    lost the session: putcall, gex, gex_SPX, gex_SPY, gex_QQQ, gex_IWM.

WHY THIS IS A HEAL AND NOT A FABRICATION
    data/polygon_gex/summary_{SPY,QQQ,IWM}.parquet are produced by the SAME engine
    (engine.gex_engine.compute_gex, via scripts/build_polygon_gex.py) with the SAME
    16-column summary schema and dtypes as data/cboe/gex_{SPY,QQQ,IWM}.parquet. This
    is a like-for-like observation of the same session from a second vendor's chain —
    not an interpolation, not a carry-forward, not a model output. Nothing is invented:
    the row is COPIED and re-dated, and the script refuses to run unless it can prove
    the row is the session it claims to be.

    Only gex_SPY/QQQ/IWM are recoverable. putcall + gex + gex_SPX stay permanently
    lost: no archive here carries SPX options (polygon's universe is equities/ETFs),
    and putcall is all-or-nothing on its _SPX leg. See collectors/cboe.py
    KNOWN_PERMANENT_GAPS[2026-07-30].

THE DATE MAPPING — THE WHOLE REASON THIS SCRIPT HAS HARD PRECONDITIONS
    SUPERSEDED FOR NEW WORK (2026-08-07). This one-shot predates #4807, which changed
    build_polygon_gex to stamp the SESSION a snapshot describes instead of the UTC run
    date. The +1 mapping below is correct for THIS heal and stays hardcoded — SESSION
    and POLYGON_STAMP are fixed dates in the pre-#4807 era, the script already ran, and
    the row it wrote is verified — but it is NOT the current mapping and must not be
    copied into new code or into operator guidance. Rows written after #4807 carry the
    session they describe with no shift, and the migration that shipped with it did NOT
    re-stamp the chain-family underlyings (SPY/QQQ/IWM/NVDA/...), so those summary files
    now hold BOTH eras. The offset is era-dependent; only the (a)+(b) identity gate below
    is era-independent, which is why it — not the stamp — is what makes a copy honest.

    build_polygon_gex stamped its accrual with `datetime.now(timezone.utc).date()`
    (scripts/build_polygon_gex._as_date), and the evening collect crosses 00:00Z before
    the polygon band runs. So a polygon row is stamped SESSION + 1 DAY:

        session 2026-07-30  →  polygon summary row stamped 2026-07-31

    Verified systematic across 2026-07-20 → 07-31: every stamp's `spot` equals the
    PRIOR session's yahoo close to 0.000%. Copying the row that merely *looks* right
    by its stamp would silently land the WRONG SESSION's gamma into the store, which
    is worse than the hole it heals — an undetectable off-by-one in a series that feeds
    the regime panel. Hence the preconditions below: the copy is refused unless the
    source row's spot both (a) matches the target session's yahoo close within
    SPOT_TOL_PCT and (b) matches that session CLOSER than any neighbouring session.
    (b) is load-bearing, not belt-and-braces: for IWM the 07-31 stamp sits within
    0.5% of BOTH the 07-30 close (0.000%) and the 07-31 close (0.477%), so the
    tolerance gate ALONE does not uniquely pin the session for that symbol.

IDEMPOTENT: a symbol whose target store already carries 2026-07-30 is skipped.
