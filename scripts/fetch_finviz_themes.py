"""Fetch the Finviz *themes* map snapshot (structure + per-timeframe performance).

Finviz's themes treemap (https://finviz.com/map?t=themes) is a curated
narrative-basket hierarchy: **theme → subsector → member tickers**. None of it
is a documented API, so this collector pulls the two feeds the page itself uses
and freezes them into a committed snapshot so the *build* (and CI) stays fully
offline:

* **Structure** — ``data/themes_heatmap/themes_tree.json`` (theme → subsector →
  members + descriptions). Lives in the repo; refreshed here only with
  ``--refresh-tree`` (it changes rarely and the source is a hash-rotated webpack
  chunk; see [[finviz-themes-map-extraction]]).
* **Performance** — ``/api/map_perf`` gives every subsector's % move for a given
  timeframe (the colour of each tile); ``/api/map_perf_screener`` gives the same
  per *member* ticker (the colour of each row in the hover popup). Both are
  pulled for all eight daily-group timeframes and written to
  ``data/themes_heatmap/perf_snapshot.json``.

The pure assembly (snapshot → the JSON the frontend reads) lives in
``engine/themes_heatmap.py``; the build wrapper is
``scripts/build_themes_heatmap.py``. This module is the only one that touches the
network.

PIT ARCHIVAL (added 2026-07-04, append-only, zero breaking changes):
* ``data/themes_heatmap/member_perf_history.jsonl`` — one line per NYSE **session**,
  compact JSON: {"asof": "YYYY-MM-DD", "subsectors": {...}, "members": {...}}.
  Idempotent: if the asof date already exists in the file the append is skipped.
  It used to be one line per CALENDAR day, which is not the same thing: daily.yml
  fires ~22:30 UTC every night INCLUDING weekends, and Finviz themes perf is EOD,
  so a Saturday and a Sunday run each re-fetched Friday's unchanged board and
  stamped it under a fresh weekend date. Stamping the SESSION (see ``_asof_stamp``)
  makes those re-fetches dedupe upstream — every downstream consumer of
  ``asof`` inherits the fix. It is also self-healing in the other direction: a
  Saturday fetch that follows a FAILED Friday fetch archives Friday's board under
  Friday, so the recovered day lands on the session it actually describes.
* ``data/themes_heatmap/tree_history.jsonl`` — one line per *change* in the tree,
  keyed by sha256(sort_keys JSON); appended only when the tree hash changes (or
  the file is empty). Format: {"asof": "YYYY-MM-DD", "sha256": "...", "tree": [...]}.

Staging note: daily.yml stages ``data/`` broadly (``git add data/``), so the two
new .jsonl files are picked up automatically — no workflow change needed.

STRUCTURE REFRESH CONTRACT (added 2026-08-14, GMI Theme Graph W3A plan §3):
``--refresh-tree`` is a STRUCTURE-ONLY mode — it re-traces the source, diffs,
receipts, promotes-or-refuses, and EXITS. It never touches the perf feeds, and
the nightly never passes it (cadence is manual/receipted-on-demand: the rights
review is unresolved and the structure has been empirically frozen since June,
so an unattended mutation cadence on an undocumented vendor route buys nothing).
DETECTION is automated instead: every normal perf run compares the subsector keys
``map_perf`` returns against the committed tree's keys and emits an advisory
line-start ``::warning`` on any symmetric difference — a source restructure goes
loud within one night while mutation stays a human-triggered, receipted act.
Exit codes: 0 promoted (or a clean ``--dry-run``), 3 refused by an interlock,
4 fetch/parse failure. A refusal is receipted too — the refusals ARE the audit
trail, and a run that leaves no receipt is indistinguishable from a run that
never happened.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

#: Stamped into every receipt. Bump when the trace or the normalisation changes
#: shape — a receipt must never be readable against the wrong extraction contract.

#: own value into the receipt's shrink/growth blocks, so a receipt says which
#: numbers judged it without anyone having to resolve a version string.

# --- shrink walls (§9.2; all four clear together under --allow-shrink) ------ #

#: Refuse when more than this fraction of PRIOR memberships disappears. Sized to
#: catch the truncation that drops the LAST member of every subtheme — 268 of
#: 2,339 = 11.5%, a read that loses one ticker per row and is otherwise perfect.
#: Genuine churn under the manual cadence is ~1.1%/7wk, so 10% is still >=4x any
#: plausible gap's drift while sitting BELOW the failure it must see.
MAX_MEMBERSHIP_REMOVAL_FRAC = 0.10

#: Theme and subtheme DELETION are zero-tolerance and symmetric. Not a fraction:
#: the structure has been frozen since June at BOTH levels, so a vanished row is
#: presumptively a truncated chunk. Deliberately keyed on deletion rather than on
#: net count — a delete plus an unrelated add nets to zero and would otherwise
#: walk straight through a count-based wall.
MAX_THEME_DELETIONS = 0
MAX_SUBTHEME_DELETIONS = 0

#: Refuse when any SINGLE subtheme loses more than this fraction of its members.
#: A total-membership wall is blind to a concentrated failure: one subtheme
#: emptied out of 268 is 0.4% of the tree and would promote silently.
MAX_SUBTHEME_MEMBER_LOSS_FRAC = 0.50

#: Refuse when more than this fraction of subthemes lose at least one member in a
#: single refresh. This is the DISTRIBUTED-truncation fingerprint — the failure
#: that hides from both walls above by staying small everywhere. The 2026-08-14
#: genuine churn touched 12% of subthemes (32 of 268); a real vendor restructure
#: that legitimately exceeds 30% arrives WITH structural changes, so it is
#: already refusing on the deletion walls and an operator is already reading it.

# --- growth walls (§9.1; all three clear together under --allow-growth) ----- #
#
# Growth is the CATASTROPHIC direction in an append-only store, and the original
# contract had no wall on it at all. A membership that should never have existed
# is minted as a permanent open edge — nothing later closes it, because the
# source never "removed" what it never had. A removal at least carries a date and
# closes an interval. Observed genuine additions are 0.4%/7wk (9 of 2,356).

MAX_MEMBERSHIP_GROWTH_FRAC = 0.10

#: Refuse when the unique-ticker count grows by more than this fraction. Catches
#: a universe-level smear that the per-subtheme cap could miss if it were spread.
MAX_TICKER_GROWTH_FRAC = 0.10

#: Per-subtheme growth cap: max(prior x MULTIPLIER, prior + ABSOLUTE). Shaped to
#: catch MIS-NESTING — reading a theme's full member union onto each of its
#: subthemes, which multiplies small rows by ~6x while leaving theme and subtheme
#: COUNTS untouched and removing nothing. The additive term keeps a genuinely
#: tiny subtheme (3 members) from tripping on ordinary growth.

# --- identity walls (§9.7; NO flag override, ever) -------------------------- #

#: A removed subtheme key and an added subtheme key are the same concept under a
#: new key when the SMALLER member set is this contained in the larger.
#: Containment of the smaller set, NOT Jaccard: review-1 measured that J>=0.8
#: misses a rename carrying one swapped member on 51.5% of live subthemes, because
#: (n-1)/(n+1) < 0.8 for every n <= 8 — i.e. the old wall was blindest exactly
#: where the tree is densest.
RENAME_CONTAINMENT_MIN = 0.60

#: Below this member count, allow ONE member of the smaller set to differ
#: regardless of the fraction: at n=2 a single swap scores 0.5 containment, which
#: is real-rename territory at that size and noise-floor territory nowhere else.
RENAME_SLACK_MAX_N = 9

#: A departed ticker and an arrived ticker whose SUBTHEME SETS differ by at most
#: this many keys are one security under a new symbol. SYMMETRIC DIFFERENCE, not
#: containment: PSTG(2 subthemes) sits entirely inside SNDK(9), so containment
#: reads 1.0 for what is actually two different issuers swapping a slot — the
#: receipted 2026-08-14 case. Symmetric difference scores that pair 7 and
#: correctly leaves it alone, while a true symbol change preserves the set (+-1
#: for co-occurring churn).
TICKER_CONTINUITY_MAX_SYMDIFF = 1

# --- nightly tripwires (advisory, never fatal) ------------------------------ #

#: Warn when member-perf coverage falls short of the tree by this many members OR
#: this fraction, whichever fires first. The 2026-08-13 board covered 923 of 941
#: — 18 dead tickers, 1.9% — so both floors would have surfaced those departures
#: near their true dates instead of at the next manual refresh.
