"""Dead-man's switch (Phase B ops hardening).

CI failures are SILENT: if the daily pipeline stops running or a swath of sources
break, the static dashboard just keeps serving stale numbers and nobody is told.
This reads data/run_status.json and fails (non-zero exit) when the pipeline looks
dead — a heartbeat workflow runs it on a schedule, so a failure trips GitHub's own
failed-run notification (and, if secrets are set, a Telegram/Discord ping).

Two failure conditions:
  • STALE — last_run older than max_age_hours (default 96h: the pipeline runs
    weekdays, so a Friday→Monday gap plus a holiday is normal; only a genuinely
    missed multi-day window should fire).
  • BROAD OUTAGE — at least `broad_outage` sources are circuit-broken (>= breaker_trip
    consecutive failures). One flaky source is graceful degradation, not death; a
    broad cluster means collection itself is down.
Individual circuit-broken sources are reported as warnings but don't fail the check.

A third tripwire, check_committed_data_freshness, detects silent data freezes where
the pipeline keeps running but collected bars stop landing in git (e.g. a failed push
loop after collection).  It reads a small set of witness parquet files from the
committed tree and fails when any witness is more than fail_after_sessions business
days stale.

A fourth tripwire, check_weekly_lane, is the dead-lane guard for weekly.yml (the
#2193 class: a job killed at timeout-minutes concludes "cancelled" — not "failed" —
so GitHub sends no notification; weekly was timeout-killed every Saturday
2026-06-13..07-11 unnoticed).  weekly.yml stamps data/weekly_status.json only after
its build chain completes and commits it with the outputs, so a timeout kill, a dead
runner, or a lost push race all leave the committed stamp stale and fail this check.
