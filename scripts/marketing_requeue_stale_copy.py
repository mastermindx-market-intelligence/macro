"""scripts/marketing_requeue_stale_copy.py — rewrite queued outbox copy in place.

WHY THIS EXISTS
A copy fix that lands AFTER the nightly has already generated a day's outbox
does not reach the queue. The nightly writes items once; the publisher posts
whatever is sitting there. So on 2026-07-26 the flagship queue held eight
weekend_levels items that carried the FIXED chart cards (generated after #3551)
but the PRE-FIX headline (generated before #3585) — every one of them still
opened "$TICKER into the week". They were scheduled for later the same day and
would have gone out the moment the publisher was re-armed.

WHAT IT DOES
Regenerates the copy for a lane's still-queued items using the CURRENT code,
carries their existing media across, quarantines the stale rows and enqueues the
rewritten ones. Media is preserved rather than re-rendered on purpose: the cards
were rendered on the nightly runner and uploaded to R2, and a local re-render
without R2 credentials would produce a card with no public URL, which Buffer
cannot attach — the post would silently go out text-only.

Only items that are still decidable are touched. Anything posted, posting or
quarantined is terminal and left exactly as it is.

SUPERSEDE, NEVER APPEND (X Growth W1g, 2026-07-31). The replacement and the
retirement are ONE operation, `engine.marketing.rewrite.apply_rewrite`, and the
retirement goes FIRST. This script used to enqueue the new copy and then
quarantine the old — which cannot work, because `outbox.enqueue` rejects
near-duplicates against a same-account 7-day corpus and a rewrite of a post is
by construction a near-duplicate of that post. Every headline-only rewrite it
attempted was refused as "duplicate" and the stale copy stayed queued (the
script's own "original left queued" warning was the symptom). Retiring the
original first drops it out of that corpus, because `_enqueue_ctx` excludes dead
ids — see the module docstring in `engine/marketing/rewrite.py`.

    # show what would change, touch nothing
    python3 -m scripts.marketing_requeue_stale_copy --as-of 2026-07-26

    # write the ledger
    python3 -m scripts.marketing_requeue_stale_copy --as-of 2026-07-26 --apply

The ledger rows this writes must be COMMITTED for the publisher to see them.
