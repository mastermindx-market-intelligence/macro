"""Intraday LIVE China risk-state -> site/live/china_risk_state.json.

The China analogue of scripts/build_risk_state.py: the fast brain for the China
Market State board on china.html. It answers the same question the nightly build
can't: "given where the Shanghai Composite / CSI 300 / Shenzhen tape and the
external capital-flow legs are RIGHT NOW, what is the radar-aware China Market
State verdict?" — so the board headline moves as the fast signals move instead of
being frozen between nightly builds.

DOCTRINE (mirrors research/LIVE_DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md for the CN market):
  - The nightly build (scripts/build_china.py) is the SLOW BRAIN. It owns the
    calibrated RORO composite (9-leg causal z-scores), the PBoC liquidity overlay,
    the QVIX+margin vol proxy, and the breadth percentile (which requires the full
    china_breadth store to compute). ALL of those remain nightly here too.
  - This is the FAST LAYER for the PRICE-DRIVEN legs only: the 3-index CN tape
    (F1/trend), the external capital-flow leg that leads A-share drawdowns
    (USD/CNH + DX-Y.NYB via risk_radar_intl), and the GTAA ETFs that let any
    engine read of those names go live. Everything else carries forward.
  - Zero logic duplication: we splice live last-prices into the price store via a
    store.read monkeypatch, then call the SAME engine.risk_radar_intl.snapshot and
    engine.market_state.market_state_snapshot the nightly build uses. The breadth
    percentile + RORO conditions that were injected in-memory by build_china are
    replicated in-memory here on a deep copy of latest.json.
  - NIGHTLY BASELINE: there is no persisted CN market_state snapshot (persist() is
    US-only in engine.market_state), so we reproduce the nightly read by running
    the identical pipeline WITHOUT the store patch. The fresh-checkout stores equal
    the Asia-close state, which is exactly what the rendered board reflects.
  - HONEST MOTION: the continuous 0-100 score moves every tick (tape leg updated on
    live prices); the discrete band WORD is debounced (must persist N ticks) so a
    noisy open can't whipsaw the headline.

LIVE LEGS (price-driven, update every tick during HKEX RTH):
  tape_trend       — 3-index CN tape (000001.SS / 510300.SS / 399001.SZ), live via splice
  radar_capital_flow — risk_radar_intl.CN: USD/CNH + DX-Y.NYB legs become live when
                     either is spliced; US rate shock legs (DGS2/DGS10/DFII10) are
                     carried (FRED, ~T+1) just as in the US build

CARRIED LEGS (nightly stores, stamped with their own as-of):
  radar_rate_shock — last date of FRED DGS10 store (~T+1 lag)
  breadth          — china_breadth/breadth last date (nightly-only, requires full store)
  vol_qvix         — china_qvix/qvix300 last date (nightly)
  risk_roro        — nightly_asof (RORO composite is nightly)
  liquidity_pboc   — nightly_asof (PBoC overlay is nightly)
  stress_guards    — nightly_asof (slowdown / drawdown gauges are nightly)

Fail-safe: any error in the live recompute logs and falls back to nightly; the JSON
always emits. --offline forces the no-network path (live == nightly). NO writes
anywhere except site/live/china_risk_state.json.
