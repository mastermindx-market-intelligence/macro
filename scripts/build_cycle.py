"""Render the Cycle Intelligence flagship page — the ENGINE-BACKED builder (D3-W3.2).

Before W3.2 this was a shell-copier: every plotted number came from the hand-typed
``site/cycle_data.js`` (audit finding A-1 — opinion wearing the visual authority of the
sibling engines).  W3.2 collapses that schism: **every MEASURED band's position, turns
and projection now come from the engine** (``sector_cycles.record_series`` over the proxy
registry's tapes), while the curated turning-point history + causal prose survive as FRAME
timelines and dated OPINION overlays.

Two-tier taxonomy (ruling A3 — exactly two user-facing words, MEASURED / FRAME):

  MEASURED band  → run ``record_series`` on the registry tape (per its kernel_params);
                   emit the engine record (rebased price / detrended osc / confirmed turns /
                   median-half-cycle projection with lo/hi band + overdue state from W1.6).
                   proxy/monthly/basis/epoch/fitness are HOVER-line details, not tiers.
  FRAME band     → emit the curated ``turns[]`` from the seed store + period stats + the
                   A8 leg-length list ("last major turn {t} ({N}y ago); prior up-legs ran
                   {list}").  NOTHING resolves to a scalar position — no oscillator, no
                   cone, no dial (ruling A8).
  DUAL card      → a MEASURED intermediate band + a thin FRAME secular strip (gold / dollar /
                   japan / bitcoin, + the memory/uranium proxy cards which carry a hand-turn
                   frame overlay).

Data flow (all script-tag data — NEVER fetch, ruling A11):
  data/cycle_ontology/proxy_registry.json     (W3.1 registry, tier per band)
  data/cycle_ontology/registry_health.json    (W3.1 per-band tape freshness)
  data/cycle_ontology/proxy_fitness.json       (W3.1 proxy timing verdicts)
  site/cycle_data.js                            (curated-turn SEED + OPINION prose)
        │
        ▼  this builder
  site/cycledata/cycle_engine.js                (window.CYCLE_ENGINE = {cid:{bands:[…]}})
  site/cycle.html                               (template shell)

Build-time discipline:
  • TOLERANCE ASSERTION (doctrine #1): where a hand-typed ``now.pos`` exists for a MEASURED
    band, the |hand − engine| gap is LOGGED (warn) and carried onto the card as a visible
    delta note.  The build FAILS only on STRUCTURAL errors (a MEASURED tape entirely
    missing / unresolvable) — never on an opinion-vs-engine gap.
  • STALENESS degrades PER-BAND, never the page (house law: a null never blocks building).
    ``registry_report(strict=True)`` raises only on structural errors; a stale tape marks
    its own band (``rec["stale"]``) and the card renders from the last data with a visible
    plain-word stale chip while every other card renders fresh.  One late G.17 release
    must never again freeze all 24 cards (the 2026-07-16/17 INDPRO freeze).

Respecting the ~67-min render budget: the tapes are tiny (~20 measured series × ~56 ms +
parquet I/O), so this stays in the seconds-to-low-minutes range; the wall-time is reported.
