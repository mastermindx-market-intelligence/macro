"""Static guard: validates site/factordata/us_standouts.json for build-time contradictions.

Five invariants checked (W2 original 4 + W4 reflexivity):

  (a) No FRESH-BUY-ish state/label with cross age > FRESH_TICKS+1 OR extension grade.
      The W8 arbiter should have demoted these at build time; a hit here means the arbiter
      missed a path.

  (b) No urgency=imminent on a row with a blocked label or BOTTOMING-class state.
      The W6-US fix 7 + W8 arbiter should close this; a hit means a new code path bypassed both.

  (c) No band high/constructive while verdict is Lagging or no-clear-edge.
      The W6-US fix 2 + W2 arbiter rule-3 should close this; a hit is a regression.

  (d) The board is in its declared sort order. Which order that IS depends on the board
      definition the artifact stamps, so this invariant has two branches:

      * us_prophet_v1 (rows carry `stage`): the order is (stage bucket, priority score
        desc, ticker). Checked as: the stage sequence never goes backwards, the score
        never rises inside a stage, and — the load-bearing one — no blocked-stage row
        sits above any live-stage row. Alpha is one of five scoring legs here, so
        alpha-desc is NOT the contract and must not be asserted.
      * legacy boards (no `stage` field): the pre-2026-08 alpha-desc-within-lane
        contract. Slot-1 alpha must not be negative while positive-alpha rows exist in
        the same lane. A violation means the sort was applied incorrectly.

  (e) W4 reflexivity (R-B): per-lane effective_bets from the board and per-lane n_eff from
      the reflexivity overlay must not diverge by more than 3x.  Both numbers are computed over
      the SAME per-lane candidate set (overlay emits n_eff_by_lane to match the population
      that build_stock_board_v2._concentration() uses).  A >3x ratio means two contradictory
      "independent bets" numbers are visible on the same lane of the board.

Exit 0 on clean. Exit 1 with a readable table on violation.
