"""R2 data-plane freshness audit (dead-man's switch for the PUBLIC data plane).

The heavy per-ticker stores (stockdata/ohlc/intraday/...) are served to the live
site from Cloudflare R2 (see scripts/publish_r2.py + templates/data_base.js), not
git/Pages. Every CI publish invocation is deliberately non-fatal (`|| ::warning::`)
and publish_r2 exits 0 when the R2_* creds are absent — so if the secrets expire or
uploads start failing, the live site keeps serving silently stale per-ticker data
forever. This audit is the tripwire.

Check: HTTP HEAD the public anchors and compare Last-Modified against now. Per
anchored dir we take the FRESHEST of `<dir>/_manifest.json` (put unconditionally on
every successful FULL publish, even no-delta days — the canonical freshness beacon;
partial lanes pass --no-manifest and leave it alone, which is why we take the
freshest of the two anchors rather than the manifest alone) and,
for the *stockdata search libraries, `<dir>/index.json` (fallback while the manifest
rollout reaches every lane; content-hash skip means index only re-uploads on change,
so it alone would false-alarm on no-delta weekends). A content-level probe parses
`asof` out of stockdata/SPY.json (the same anchor the Mastermind bot tripwires on),
catching the subtler failure where publishes run but ship an old build. Cloudflare
403s pythonish User-Agents on r2.dev, so we send a custom one.

Verdicts: STALE / DARK (no anchor object at all) / FORBIDDEN (bucket public access
broken) / CONTENT STALE are definitive server responses -> FAIL. Network-layer
errors (DNS, timeout) after retries are INDETERMINATE -> warning only, so a flaky
runner can't fake an outage. Stdlib-only on purpose: the heartbeat venv installs no
requirements.

Consumers:
  * scripts/healthcheck.py folds this into the scheduled heartbeat (telegram + red run).
  * daily.yml / asia-close.yml run `--strict --max-age-hours 2` right after their
    publish_r2 step, so a silently-failed/skipped publish reddens THAT run's summary.
Writes data/quality/r2_audit.json (observability only; read-only over data stores).

Usage: python -m scripts.audit_r2 [--strict] [--anchors stockdata,chinastockdata]
                                  [--max-age-hours 26] [--base URL]
