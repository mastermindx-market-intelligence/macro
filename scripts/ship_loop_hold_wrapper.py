"""Bounded HOLD-FOR-SOL state adapter in front of the completion guard.

The main completion guard deliberately treats an ordinary unmerged PR as unfinished.
That remains correct. A different state exists in repository law, however: Sol/CEO
may explicitly order a specific PR held for review. DEC:SOL-HOLD-IS-A-MERGE-BARRIER
then requires the PR to be draft, disarmed, and unmerged. Waiting for that prohibited
merge is unsatisfiable and used to make Claude repeat ``SHIP LOOP BLOCKED`` until the
generic ten-block escape ladder fired.

This front-end is intentionally narrow and fail-closed. It probes only two shapes:
an ordinary ``unmerged`` hold candidate on a sanctioned ``claude/*`` branch, or a
local branch in Sol's ``sol/*`` authority namespace. The latter is recognized before
the canonical guard emits its first ``unsafe_branch`` response, because even one
false rename-oriented instruction can mutate the identity of an explicitly held PR.
Normal non-Sol sessions pay only a local branch-name read and never spend GitHub quota
unless the canonical guard has already reached ``unmerged``.

A candidate must still prove the exact pushed head, a clean worktree, a draft PR whose
title starts ``HOLD-FOR-SOL``, no ``merge-on-green`` label, no native auto-merge,
recorded Sol authority and Sol release condition, and binding check evidence. A
concluded-green candidate becomes ``SHIP LOOP PARKED``.

A valid hold whose checks are still pending or red is intercepted for BOTH candidate
kinds: pending checks produce a non-terminal HOLD wait and red checks produce a HOLD
repair block, both explicitly forbidding branch/PR identity mutation. Before
2026-08-28 that interception was ``sol/*``-only, so an ordinary ``claude/*`` hold was
told to squash-merge a PR that repository law forbids merging for the whole pre-green
window (121 consecutive such blocks on PR #6608). The interception is a *message*
correction, never a permission one — both paths still block, and ``parked`` remains
the sole terminal exit and still demands every binding check concluded green.

Every malformed/ambiguous hold and every non-``sol/*`` unsafe branch delegates
byte-for-byte to the canonical guard. Ordinary branch, merge, CI, render, and live
enforcement therefore remains unchanged.

    THE SCAR. Until 2026-08-28 this returned early unless the branch was ``sol/*``.
    An ordinary ``claude/*`` branch carrying a fully ratified hold — draft, disarmed,
    Sol authority and Sol release condition recorded, exact head pushed, worktree
    clean — therefore fell through to the canonical guard for the entire pre-green
    window and was told to "complete commit -> push -> PR -> CI -> squash-merge ->
    render/deploy -> live verification". That instruction is unfollowable by
    construction: DEC:SOL-HOLD-IS-A-MERGE-BARRIER forbids merging the very PR the
    message demands be merged, and the sweeper is barred from it too. Measured on the
    TFG-1 R3 records carrier (PR #6608): 121 consecutive blocks in that state, every
    one advising an action repository law prohibits. A guard that repeats an illegal
    instruction teaches sessions to distrust the guard, which is worse than silence.

    Deliberately NOT a widening of permission. Status ``parked`` is still the only
    terminal exit and still requires every binding check concluded green; the pending
    and red paths below both return ``decision: block``. This changes only WHICH
    correct-shaped block a lawful hold receives, so the session waits or repairs
    instead of being pointed at a forbidden merge. ``_parked_hold`` is untouched.

    The ``sol/*`` case keeps its extra branch-identity warning because renaming a Sol
    authority branch causes GitHub to close/rekey the held PR; ordinary holds get the
    same do-not-mutate guidance without the rename-specific framing.

    WHAT IS TERMINAL, AND WHAT IS NOT. The old wording called PARKED "a terminal
    PARKED state ... do not re-enter the ship loop", which reads as terminal for the
    whole session. That is true of the ship/merge attempt and false of the reciprocal

    A held worker that treats PARKED as all five goes silent on the holding authority,
    and Mastermind's universal session-close law is explicit that silence is never a
    terminal receipt. So the message now separates them: the ship attempt is over, the
    dialogue is not, and the same child/carrier/branch/PR resume on a Sol continuation.

    NOT a widening of permission. Reaching this function still requires every binding
