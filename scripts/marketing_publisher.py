"""scripts/marketing_publisher.py — D02 W1 live social publisher.

The missing publish half of the desk network: takes APPROVED, DUE items from
the outbox and posts them through a backend (Buffer today). Off the render
path; operator-run or nightly-cron; DARK BY DEFAULT.

Usage:
    # dry-run (default): print exactly what WOULD post, zero network calls
    python -m scripts.marketing_publisher
    python -m scripts.marketing_publisher --account flagship

    # discover Buffer channel ids (needs BUFFER_TOKEN in env)
    BUFFER_TOKEN=... python -m scripts.marketing_publisher --list-channels

    # LIVE post — requires BOTH flags together:
    MARKETING_PUBLISH_ENABLED=1 BUFFER_TOKEN=... \
        python -m scripts.marketing_publisher --live --account flagship

Guards (ALL must pass or the runner no-ops with a clear log line):
  * kill-switch  sentinel.publish_enabled() is true AND --live was passed
  * per-account daily cap  outbox.effective_cap(cfg), counted ledger-based via
                           outbox.posted_today_by_account (folded status
                           posted/posting whose last transition landed today —
                           nightly items post the day AFTER their as_of)
  * per-item     social_publisher.validate_postable() (280 cap, link policy,
                 empty text)

No-double-post guarantee:
  * validate fail          → item transitioned to `quarantined` (reason), never posted
  * before the network call → `approved → posting` (durable in-flight marker)
  * publish success         → `posting → posted`, Receipt recorded in the ledger
  * publish failure         → `posting → failed`, error recorded
  * item already `posting` at startup → REPORTED and LEFT AS-IS, never reposted
    (a crash mid-post must not double-post on the next run)

Backend + per-account channel id come from config/marketing.yml `publish:`; the
Buffer token from env BUFFER_TOKEN. Structured logging throughout.

    liveness is UNKNOWN (the accounts model could not be consulted).

    The accounts model is the single reader of that question — config intent
    (``enabled``, legacy ``disabled: true``) plus the operator override file
    data/marketing/account_overrides.json — and sentinel.gate_plan resolves the
    plan-path version of this list with the identical predicate. Both paths call
    effective_accounts and test ``not enabled`` so the nightly plan and a
    dispatch can never disagree about which desk is armed.

    FAIL DIRECTION, deliberately the OPPOSITE of wire_routing._enabled_accounts.
    That module treats unknown liveness as route-to-default because it HAS a safe
    fallback account to route to; the publisher has no safe fallback for "may
    this desk post at all", and failing closed would park every live desk on a
    transient helper error — a seven-desk outage to protect one dark one, which
    is the worse failure. Unknown therefore stands the gate down INERT for the
    run (items flow exactly as they did before this gate existed) and says so in
    the Actions summary. None and the empty set are still DIFFERENT answers and
    callers must not conflate them: empty means "asked, a real roster came back,
    nothing on it is dark".

    TWO shapes are unknown, not one, and the second is the silent-disarm the
    first review caught: an EMPTY roster. effective_accounts reads
    ``cfg.desk_network.accounts``, and every way that key can go missing —
    _load_marketing_cfg failing soft to {}, a mis-indented block, a renamed key,
    a checkout with no config — returns [] rather than raising. Read as "nothing
    is dark" that silently disarms the gate on the exact configs least likely to
    be correct (probe: channels bound, no desk_network → a dark item posts, rc 0,
    no annotation). A publisher with no roster does not KNOW which desks are
    armed, so it says so and goes inert loudly instead of quietly.

    or todays action tomorrow. no human would post stale data like that." The
    two checks above ask whether a WORD in the copy is false; neither asks
    whether the whole post has been overtaken by a new session. A theme_list
    planned for 2026-08-05T12:00Z reading "+1.9% avg on Tuesday" passed both of

    approved at any hour, so a generation-time freshness check answers the

    itself (and the four boundaries it must not break); this call is the wiring.

    same-day tape copy, and a "today"/"tonight"/"yesterday" whose calendar
    arithmetic does not work out. Composed into
    `market_clock.clock_violations` alongside the three above, so the approval
    desk's battery and this one ask exactly the same question. The composition

    shipped would have let that pair through here too.

    OWNERSHIP IS RESOLVED UP FRONT, NOT BY EVALUATION ORDER (this is the part
    that is easy to get wrong). A naive "does any live sibling share my anchor?"
    test makes six siblings annihilate each other — the first item sees the
    second and dies, the second sees the third and dies, and the fact ends up
    with ZERO posts instead of one. The brief says "quarantine all but one", so
    exactly one id is named the owner before the loop starts and every other
    holder of that anchor is refused, whatever order they are visited in.

    OPERATOR LAW, 2026-07-30, stated in these words after seeing the live
    account: "YOU WILL NOT SHIP THESE TEXT ONLY, ID RATHER YOU DESTROY THE
    ENTIRE ENGINE THAN SHIP TEXT ONLY, CUZ NO ONE CARES ABOUT THESE TICKER POSTS
    IF UR GOING TO SHIP THEM NAKED WITH NO CHARTS."

    …AND THE OPERATOR NARROWED IT, 2026-08-06, IN ONE PLACE: "CHARTS YES, TEXT
    CARDS NO." A WIRE FLASH that merely mentions a ticker MAY ship text-only when
    its card was drawn, MEASURED, and found to only restate the post. The
    operator's reasoning, recorded here because it is the whole argument: A CHART
    IS DATA; A TEXT CARD IS A SCREENSHOT OF THE POST. Withholding a screenshot of
    the post is not shipping naked — there was nothing under the clothes.

    THE 2026-07-30 LAW KEEPS ITS FULL FORCE EVERYWHERE ELSE, unchanged: the
    price/rollup posts it was written about — every kind in
    ``_CHART_BEARING_KINDS`` and ``_TICKER_ROLLUP_KINDS``, i.e. `signal`,
    `chart`, `watchlist`, `receipt`, `theme_list`, `mover` — carry a real chart
    or they do not ship, withheld stamp or no withheld stamp. That scoping is
    :func:`_card_withheld_for_value`'s kind test, and it is pinned both ways by
    tests/test_marketing_card_earns_pixels.py::
    test_the_withheld_exemption_does_not_reach_a_chart_bearing_kind and
    ::test_a_real_press_emission_relabelled_to_a_rollup_kind_is_still_quarantined.

    THIS IS A NARROWING BY THE OPERATOR, NOT BY A BUILDER. The engineering
    argument (the lane drew a card, measured it against the copy, and found it
    said nothing the copy did not) was made in this docstring for one day with no
    ruling cited, and the round-3 review was right to refuse to merge on it. It
    is cited now.

    :func:`_missing_required_media` could not enforce that. It keys on
    ``_CHART_BEARING_KINDS`` (signal/chart/watchlist/receipt) AND requires a
    ``media[]`` entry to already exist — it defers a post whose chart was BUILT
    and failed to upload. The posts actually reaching the timeline were
    `theme_list` and `mover`: not chart-bearing kinds, carrying no media at all,
    so both conditions missed and they auto-posted bare. Measured on the live
    flagship account: "Insurance - Property & Casualty: 7 of 7 names lower right
    now, median -3.9%. Worst: $ERIE -6.1%, $TRV -4.6%, $ALL -4.1%" — 3 views.
    Its siblings drew 1, 2 and 4.

    So the rule is keyed on what the operator actually said: a post that NAMES
    TICKERS ships a picture. A post with no cashtag (macro prose, education, a
    breadth read) is unaffected.

    TWO CASES, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IGNORES THE KIND (defect closed 2026-07-31):

    * A CARD WAS BUILT (media[] holds a dict) and its URL never resolved. The
      producing lane decided this post owes a picture; shipping it without one
      is the violation regardless of kind, so every kind is covered. That is the
      hole `breaking` fell through, and it stays closed.
    * NO CARD AT ALL. Here the KIND decides, exactly as it decides for
      :func:`_missing_required_media` — see the contract stated at
      ``_TICKER_ROLLUP_KINDS``: "`macro`, `education`, `event`, `wire` … are
      deliberately ABSENT. A breadth read may mention $SPY in passing; that is
      not a post about $SPY, and holding it for an upload strangles the desks'
      non-ticker voice for a rule written about rollups."

      This function ran ``_CASHTAG_RE.findall`` unconditionally over EVERY kind,
      which quietly overrode that contract at the one seam where it has teeth:
      a macro read ending "even $SPY is stretched", for which no lane builds a
      chart and none ever will, was QUARANTINED — terminal, on a post that owes
      nothing. `_missing_required_media` refused the same widening by text
      ("THE KIND DECIDES, NOT THE TEXT"); this gate now says the same thing.

      `breaking` IS in scope here on purpose, unlike in the deferral gate: the
      hot-tape group posts that drew the operator's complaint are `breaking`,
      19 of them queued and quarantined on 2026-07-30, and the radar now draws

    WHY THIS EXISTS. The floor guarantees "no two posts closer than
    min_minutes_between_any_posts". The original enforcement deferred any item
    inside the floor to the next cron sweep, which silently made the SWEEP the
    unit of throughput: 30 sweeps/day → at most 30 posts/day network-wide, no
    matter how many the desks generated or what the per-account caps allowed.
    With the desks generating ~59/day that quietly strands more than half the
    queue every day, and it degrades further whenever a sweep is dropped.

    Booking forward enforces the SAME spacing without that coupling: the item is
    handed to Buffer as a customScheduled post at (floor + spacing), so the send
    times are identical to what the defer path would eventually have produced —
    they are simply reserved now instead of re-derived one sweep at a time.

    The horizon is the safety bound, and it is a TAPE-FRESHNESS bound, not a
    performance knob: every item is verified against live quotes at BOOK time
    (live_verify), so booking N minutes ahead ships a read that is up to N
    minutes stale. Keep it near the live gate's own max_quote_age_min rather

        that would fire stale the day someone flips the switch. The reason class
        is ``account_disabled``, which sentinel holds in _ALWAYS_ENFORCED: no
        operator exception overrides it, and neither does an operator --post-now
        (see ``only_ids`` below). The remedy is the desk_network flip.

        (so auto-approve never over-fills the queue past the cap)

    DRY-RUN safety: when ``live`` is False this makes NO ledger writes — it only
    logs and returns the ids it WOULD approve. The queued→approved transition is
    applied via outbox.transition() ONLY when ``live`` is True.

    ``announce`` False silences the dark-desk annotation for the writeless admin
    preview (same reason resolve_ramp takes announce=False there). It is not
    cosmetic: the annotation is once-per-account-per-PROCESS, so a preview that
    printed it would also CONSUME it and the real dispatch behind it would park
    silently. A preview is not a dispatch and must leave that budget alone — and
    for the same reason a DRY-RUN never annotates either, whatever ``announce``
    says. ``parked_out`` is the matching sink — the caller that cannot read the
    log (the preview builds a dict; main() folds the count into its summary) gets
    the parked ids appended to it.

    ``only_ids`` is the operator "post now" override: the pass considers ONLY
    those ids and drops the kind scope (the operator's click IS the approval for
    any kind). It does NOT relax a hold, nor any of the gates above — an item

    # covers `queued` AND `approved` alike, and the publish sweep DOES reach it
    # — but only through `approval_desk.run` above, which returns early on
    # `approval_desk.enabled: false`. So the standing 36h window on a planned
    # item is enforced at dispatch time exactly as long as the desk is armed,
    # and switching the desk off silently switches the age gate off with it.
    # The publisher, which is the lane that actually puts words on X, selects on
    # "approved AND due": `_select_approved_due` asks how LATE an item is, never
    # how OLD, so a two-day-old approved post is a perfectly good candidate.
    #
    # That is not hypothetical here. The Buffer plan locked on 2026-08-06 and
    # the requeue branch below walked every refused item straight back to
    # `approved` on every sweep — an approved backlog is exactly what this
    # window exists to stop from firing days later as news.

    # ONE POLICY, TWO CALLERS: this is the SAME function, the same transitions
    # and the same note as the desk's call and the nightly emit's. It runs only
    # when the desk did NOT, so a run can never apply two different windows.
