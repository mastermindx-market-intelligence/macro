"""Build the F04-X1 WTI Live Trace public shell -> site/ontology.html.

Feature-owned builder, deliberately standalone. It does NOT extend
`scripts/build_site.py`: that file is owned by an open sibling carrier, and a
new page is not a reason to contend for a shared hunk when a small script can
own itself.

The one rule this builder must never break is that it reads NOTHING from
`data/transmission/`. The page it writes is served publicly and cached, so a
current value rendered into it at build time would be a premium reading
published to a public CDN. Current values reach the researcher only through the
authenticated API, at request time, in the browser.

Usage: python -m scripts.build_ontology_explorer
