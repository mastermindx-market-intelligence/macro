"""US SCAN TIER — the widened seeing set (PROPHET US roadmap §4.5).

Operator ratification 2026-08-05 ("Yes we should do the full universe then"),
after the receipts that FNV / FSM / EXK / AG / SBSW were structurally invisible:
not merely un-admitted, but absent from every frame the engine looks at.

WHAT THIS LANE DOES, IN ORDER

  1. resolve the liquidity-floored scan universe over ``data/massive_stock_day``
     (``engine/us_scan_universe.py``), MINUS the curated universe;
  2. stamp one US Context Vector row per scan name with ``tier="scan"``
     (``engine/us_context_vector.py``, the same monthly parts the curated stamp
     writes — keep-first makes the curated row win on any overlap);
  3. write the scan-tier runner-exclusion audit
     (``engine/prophet_miss_audit.build_scan_tier_audit``) to
     ``data/prophet_scan_tier/latest.json`` + append its forward-log row.

WHAT IT EXPLICITLY DOES NOT DO

  Board ADMISSION, gates, scores, ranks, sizing and plan intake are UNCHANGED.
  The curated universe remains the graded population. Nothing written here is
  read for any decision — "see everything, admit selectively."

WHY ITS OWN LANE, NOT THE ENGINE JOB
  The scan pass needs ``data/massive_stock_day`` (617 MB, ~20k parquets,
  R2-canonical). The engine job does NOT restore it — the three restores in
  daily.yml live in ``collect``, ``oracle_offrender`` and ``standout_audit_us``.
  Adding a 617 MB restore plus ~13 min of gating to a job that already runs
  135-190 min against a 200-min cap is exactly the budget-buster the charter
  warns against, so this runs post-engine in its own lane with its own timeout.

MEASURED COST (this Mac Studio, 2026-08-04, 3,980-name floored set)
  store census (all 20,476 files, close+volume only)   30 s
  close panel read (3,980 names)                      ~10 s
  signal_gate.gate per name (deep series)            ~120 ms
  context_frame per name (11 dims)                     74 ms
  => ~13 min for the full assembly. Off the render path, off the engine job.

NIGHTLY-ONLY LAW. ``--nightly`` is the sole advancer: it writes the artifact,
appends the forward-log row, and arms the context-vector stamp. A default
invocation computes and prints and writes NOTHING. ``--out-dir DIR`` runs the
full write into a scratch dir, never the real store. The forward append is
idempotent on ``price_through``, so a same-night re-run appends nothing.

Run (nightly / DAG):   python -m scripts.run_us_scan_tier --nightly
Run (safe local test): python -m scripts.run_us_scan_tier --out-dir /tmp/scan
Run (dry, no writes):  python -m scripts.run_us_scan_tier --no-stamp

    whose fetch list IS a curated universe. It stops holding once the hub backfill
    runs: a parquet then means "the hub signal ledger mentioned this ticker", which
    is the opposite of curated. Measured 2026-08-08, a fully drained backfill queue
    would have moved 4,601 names out of the scan tier this way — silently, since
    the exclusion is an absence.

    ONLY is load-bearing: a ticker the backfill created that the collector ALSO
    maintains (a config name whose parquet did not exist yet) is genuinely curated
    and must stay excluded. Hence the intersection with the collector's maintained
    set rather than a bare read of ``done``.
