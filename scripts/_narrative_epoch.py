"""Epoch-aware narrative loading + build-time re-key guard — Cycle Intelligence W2.1.

Shared by build_sector_cycles / build_country_cycles / build_china_sector_cycles so all
three resolve the SAME way (ruling A5: one epoch scheme, one file convention).

Resolution (per engine, per data dir):
  1. compute the engine's CURRENT epoch from its declared (basis, zz_pct, detector_version)
     via engine.cycle_ontology.turn_epoch();
  2. if data/<dir>/narratives.<epoch>.json exists → load it (the migrated, current-epoch file);
  3. else fall back to the legacy un-suffixed data/<dir>/narratives.json, tagged epoch
     'tr_v0' (LEGACY_TR_EPOCH) — this is the CURRENT total-return epoch by definition.

Zero behaviour change today: no basis flip has happened, so no narratives.<epoch>.json
exists, so every engine resolves to the legacy file exactly as before.  Byte-identity of
built narrative bindings is an acceptance test (tests/test_rekey_narratives.py).

The re-key GUARD (never fatal, additive — the house pattern): if a *migrated* epoch file
IS expected (i.e. the engine's basis/threshold was flipped) but is MISSING, the loader
would otherwise silently serve stale, mis-keyed legs.  `resolve_narratives()` returns a
`stale_quarantined` flag + a loud warning so the builder can render an empty/quarantined
narrative map rather than a mis-keyed one.  The DECISION of whether an epoch file is
*required* is: the legacy file is only a valid fallback for the LEGACY_TR_EPOCH; if the
engine declares any OTHER epoch and no matching file exists, that is the stale case.
