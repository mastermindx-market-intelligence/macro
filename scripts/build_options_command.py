"""Build the Options workspace -> site/options.html  (OEU lane M-CMD).

THE CANONICAL OPTIONS SURFACE. One page, four modes (Daily Brief / Scanner /
Ticker / Leaders), assembled STRICTLY by re-serialising stores that other
builders already wrote.  Ruling: research/options_estate/OEU_MASTERPLAN.md §2.
Pinned design: research/options_estate/WORKSPACE_DESIGN_SPEC.md (markup and CSS
copied from mockups/oeu_workspace/options_mockup.html).

CONTRACT — read before changing anything here
─────────────────────────────────────────────
1. NO NEW DERIVATIONS.  Every state word on this page is an EXISTING payload
   enum rendered through an EXISTING house label map (the maps are cited inline
   against the template that already ships them).  This builder computes no
   scores, no rankings, no fused composites, and NO THRESHOLD BANDS
   (WORKSPACE_DESIGN_SPEC §0.13).  The one numeric filter it applies —
   |dist_to_flip_pct| <= 1 for the "sitting near a flip level" rail group — is
   the options_screener page's OWN shipped `nearflip` preset value
   (templates/options_screener.html.j2:959), reused rather than reinvented.
2. THE FOUR POSTURE READINGS ARE CO-DISPLAYED, NEVER FUSED.  They are four
   independent payload states printed side by side.  Nothing averages them.
3. DISPLAY TIER ONLY.  Nothing here feeds rank / size / gate.  The word
   "validated" never appears in user copy; the console's vetted glyph is gated
   on the vol payload's own `scored` flag exactly as gex.html gates its badge,
   and it prints a glyph, never the word.
4. O(SECONDS).  Pure JSON reads + re-serialisation.  No engine work, no network.
   Runs AFTER build_flow_desk / build_options_screener / build_flow_leaders /
   build_market_structure so it never renders a generation-stale page.
5. FAIL-SOFT, NEVER FAKE.  A missing store degrades exactly one section to its
   honest empty state and is named in the session-stamp quality receipt.  A
   render/write failure preserves the previous page and returns non-zero so the
   closing-bell lane records that this session did not publish.

Payload law (spec §6): the Brief and the whole persistent chrome are baked
inline; Scanner / Ticker / Leaders payloads are lazy-fetched by the page on mode
activation with plain fetch() — never a JS-injected <script> loader (that
bypasses asset stamping, #3372).

Run:  python -m scripts.build_options_command
      python -m scripts.build_options_command --out /tmp/options.html
