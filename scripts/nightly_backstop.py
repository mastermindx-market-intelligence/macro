"""Re-fire the US nightly when the night produced nothing — the CN lane's idiom.

WHY THE US LANE NEEDED THIS AND THE CN LANE DID NOT.  The operator's observation
on 2026-08-13 was exact: "China side perfectly refreshes nightly and we've been
having a week of problems on US side."  The asymmetry is structural, not luck:

    asia-close.yml  (CN/HK)   71,284 bytes   FIVE cron slots — 06:00, 06:40,
                                             07:20, 08:30, 09:30 UTC, commented
                                             in-file as "early bird" x3, "the
                                             original on-time slot", "backstop"
    daily.yml       (US)     465,841 bytes   ONE effective fire: a DST PAIR at
                                             22:30Z/23:30Z of which et_gate keeps
                                             exactly one

CN can lose a fire — to a runner outage, a cancellation, a transient collector
failure — and the next slot picks the night up.  The US lane gets one shot, so
any single loss costs a whole session of ledger that only the next night or a
force-majeure backfill can recover.  On 2026-08-11/12 it lost two in a row: the
#5362 workflow-size strand killed the cron outright, and every manual recovery
dispatch was force-cancelled.

WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE FILE AND NOT MORE CRONS IN daily.yml.  Adding the CN shape
literally would mean editing a workflow that already sits at 91% of GitHub's
512,000-byte processing cliff — the exact file whose growth caused this outage —
and entangling et_gate's DST regime matching, which is what guarantees the
nightly runs exactly once.  A separate small lane buys the same redundancy while
touching neither.

THE DISPATCH RULE.  Fire ONLY into a night that has produced nothing:

    any run queued or in progress   -> SKIP.  Never dispatch over a live run.
                                       This is the 2026-08-09 ci.yml livelock,
                                       where main-ref dispatches shared one
                                       cancel-in-progress group and each new
                                       dispatch killed the proof the whole fleet
                                       was waiting on — the escape hatch WAS the
                                       lock.  A long job inside its timeout is
                                       not evidence that it is wedged; tonight's
                                       bake ran 2h+ in `collect` and was healthy.
    any run concluded success       -> SKIP.  The night landed.
    >= MAX_DISPATCHES already fired -> SKIP and say so.  A systematically broken
                                       night must not become a dispatch storm on
                                       a 3-slot self-hosted pool; the liveness
                                       guard alarms at 08:00Z instead.
    cannot tell (API error)         -> SKIP.  Dispatching blind is how the
                                       livelock above happened.  Fail SAFE here,
                                       which for an ACTION means doing nothing —
                                       note that this is the opposite polarity
                                       from check_nightly_liveness.py, where
                                       blindness must not raise an alarm.
    otherwise                       -> DISPATCH.

et_gate lets a dispatch through unconditionally (`verdict = "true" if (event !=
"schedule" or fired == intended)`), so a backstop run executes the full pipeline
rather than being skipped as an off-regime firing.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/nightly_backstop.py              # decide and act
    python3 scripts/nightly_backstop.py --dry-run    # decide, print, never fire
    python3 scripts/nightly_backstop.py --selftest   # synthetic assertions

Exit codes:
    0  a decision was reached (dispatched, or correctly skipped)
    1  a dispatch was attempted and failed
