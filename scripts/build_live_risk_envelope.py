SAME COMPOSER, FRESHER OBSERVATIONS
------------------------------------
This module never forks the state logic. It calls the SAME pure composer
(`engine.risk_envelope.compose_envelope`) and the SAME source adapters
(`scripts.build_risk_envelope._market_state_read` / `_leadership_crack_read` /
`_risk_radar_read`) the settled lane uses — reshaping the live plane's own artifacts
into the doc shapes those adapters already expect, and handing each adapter an
explicit `stale_override` computed from the live plane's own clock. No new mapping
from a state word to a hazard stage exists anywhere in this file (guarded:
`tests/test_live_risk_envelope.py` AST-scans this module for exactly that shape).

Authority: DISPLAY / ADVISORY ONLY. All four envelope authority booleans are hard-false
by construction (`engine.risk_envelope._authority()`); this module adds no authority of
its own and never writes a durable forward ledger (guarded: an import-set scan plus a
tmp-ROOT run asserting the only write is `site/live/risk_envelope.json`).

CLOCK LAW
---------
A source whose own clock is AHEAD of the live session it is being read into, or whose
carrying artifact's clock sits more than 120s ahead of wall-clock, is refused —
`unusable`, never a substituted "now". An unknown clock stays `None`; this module never
invents one. Refusing a REQUIRED source nulls the stage via the composer's own null law
(`engine/risk_envelope.py::_hazard_summary`) — it is never worked around here.

FOUR CLOCK ROLES (GD-3R1) — the published `clocks` block separates feed/source
delay from Grey Deer processing latency from browser paint latency:
  - SOURCE EVENT CLOCK (`clocks.event_time`): the real source-market quote clock —
    read verbatim from `risk_state.json["live"]["source_event_time"]` (itself the
    newest spliced quote's own `quote_ts`, stamped by scripts/build_risk_state.py).
    NEVER `risk_state["built"]`, never any builder wall clock; absent/unparseable
    -> `null`. Naive (tz-less) clocks are dropped, never assumed UTC (F5); a clock
    more than 120s ahead of `now` is refused as defense-in-depth (F6) — the source
    side (scripts/build_risk_state.py's `_source_event_time`) already excludes a
    single glitched leg from its own max, but this reader never trusts one upstream
    computation alone for a law this load-bearing.
  - UPSTREAM ARTIFACT CLOCK (`clocks.upstream_built`): the fast lane's own recorded
    wall-clock stamp (`risk_state.json["built"]`), carried here as separate
    lineage — never repurposed as `event_time`. Adjudication #3 (restored, F1): a
    future-refused carrying clock is never republished under ANY key, including
    this one — `stale_reason` ("refused_future") already explains the omission.
  - OBSERVATION CLOCK (`clocks.observed_at`): sampled here, in THIS module, at the
    point it reads its upstream artifacts.
  - PRODUCTION CLOCK (`clocks.produced_at`): sampled here, in THIS module, at
    compose/publish — a second, independent real clock sample in production.
    Published at millisecond resolution (F2) so two genuinely distinct samples
    serialize as distinct strings; this is a RESOLUTION guarantee, not a claim
    that the two samples can never coincide (a test's frozen clock, or an
    exceptionally fast production run, still can).

WHAT "LIVE SESSION L" IS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A LITERAL FIELD READ
------------------------------------------------------------------
The GD-3 commission and command packet name the source as `risk_state.json["session"]`.
That key is `engine.live_overlay.market_session()`'s advisory `{region, open,
local_time}` dict (scripts/build_risk_state.py:315) — it carries no date, so it cannot
serve as the comparable session identifier the precedence law needs (L > S / L == S /
L < S against the settled envelope's `source_session`, a date string). L is therefore
derived from a date ALREADY inside the explicitly-permitted-to-read artifact —
`risk_state.json["built"]`, the fast lane's own recorded UTC build timestamp — via
`lib.nyse_calendar.session_date()`, the same live-session-date bridge the codebase
already uses elsewhere. This is a deliberate, documented resolution of an underspecified
field (see the PR body / worker report), not a silent redesign: it reads only data the
spec explicitly permits, invents no wall-clock instant of its own, and answers the exact
question the precedence law needs answered ("what trading day is the live plane
watching").

DIVISION OF LABOUR
------------------
`engine/risk_envelope.py` is pure. `scripts/build_risk_envelope.py` owns the settled
I/O AND the only source-adapter authority (never forked here). THIS file owns the live
plane's own I/O: `site/live/risk_state.json` (raw `live` block only — the debounced
`display` block is NEVER read, guarded by source scan + a fixture test), `data/
leadership_crack/latest.json` (no live LC artifact exists; carried forward per the
settled convention), and `data/risk_envelope/latest.json` (the settled bundle this
overlay compares against).

Never fatal: any missing/unreadable input degrades to MISSING coverage the same way the
settled builder does.

R3 GAP-1 — MATERIALITY FIRING LEDGER (additive, Grey-Deer-coordinated)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
`_advance_transition` (the dwell/debounce state machine below) is UNCHANGED by this
addition: every branch, condition, and returned field it already published is byte-
identical. The only addition is that the two points where it ACCEPTS a stage change
(a debounce-confirmed escalation or de-escalation actually adopted into
`live_transition.stable_stage`) now also record that acceptance in an internal-only
`_accepted` key, popped off by `build()` before the transition dict is persisted to
`site/live/risk_envelope.json` — the published wrapper shape is unchanged.

When `build()` sees an acceptance, it emits exactly one
`engine.neuralweb.reflexes.record_firing("risk_envelope_materiality", …)` row —
`is_context_only=True` telemetry (Article 2 perimeter: annotates the spine index,
feeds no score/allocation/ranking surface), never a graded forward ledger and never a
market verdict (instrument-verdict law: this is telemetry about a state READ). The
call is wrapped in try/except and logged at debug on failure — a firing-ledger error
must never break the envelope build. No firing on a repeated/frozen observation, a
non-accepted (still-pending) tick, or a `precedence != "live"` supersede/settle.

This DOES add a second file write (`data/reflexes/risk_envelope_materiality/
firings.jsonl`) on the (rare — debounce-gated) fires where a transition is actually
accepted; `tests/test_live_risk_envelope.py::TestNoLedger` fixtures never reach an
acceptance in one shot (default `debounce_ticks=3`, cold-start ticks start at 1), so
that guard's "only write" assertion is unaffected by this addition.
