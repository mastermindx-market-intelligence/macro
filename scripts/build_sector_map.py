"""Build data/breadth/ticker_sectors.parquet — a comprehensive ticker→GICS-sector map.

Sources (priority order):
  1. GICS direct: data/breadth/constituents.parquet (S&P 500, source='gics_sp500'),
                  data/midcap_breadth/constituents.parquet (S&P 400, source='gics_sp400'),
                  data/smallcap_breadth/constituents.parquet (S&P 600, source='gics_sp600').
     These carry exact GICS classification from the index provider.
  2. SIC text mapping: data/profile/profiles.parquet (.sic_description → sector via the
     _SIC_TEXT_MAP lookup table below, source='sic_mapped').
  3. Numeric SIC mapping: data/edgar/cik_sic.json (CIK→SIC) joined via
     data/edgar/fundamentals_panel.parquet (ticker→CIK), then SIC range→sector
     via _SIC_RANGE_MAP (source='sic_mapped').

Output: data/breadth/ticker_sectors.parquet with columns:
    ticker  str      stock symbol
    sector  str      one of the 11 GICS-style sector strings
    source  str      'gics_sp500' | 'gics_sp400' | 'gics_sp600' | 'sic_mapped'

Coverage target: ≥1,500 of the 2,589 sp1500_pit_membership tickers on first run
(limited by profiles.parquet coverage for historical/delisted tickers).  Coverage
grows on subsequent runs as the cik_sic.json drip cache fills via edgar_emergence.

GICS-style sector strings (matching constituents.parquet):
  Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Energy,
  Financials, Health Care, Industrials, Information Technology, Materials,
  Real Estate, Utilities

Program: Long-Hold Thesis Layer — LT-1c (sector map expansion).
Synapse: data/breadth/ticker_sectors.parquet (tier: display, horizon_role: context).
FIREWALL: display-only, horizon_role=context, scored_path_surfaces=[].
