"""Regime freshness self-heal -> re-stamp data/regime/latest.json when the price store
has advanced past the regime's as-of.

WHY (the observed bug): the nightly regime engine (engine.run) can run BEFORE the latest
daily close lands in the store. Three real failure modes seen in the git history:
  1. A separate/late "daily collection" commit adds today's SPY bar MINUTES after the last
     regime recompute (e.g. 2026-07-01: engine-render at 23:29 UTC saw only the 06-30 bar;
     the 07-01 bar landed at 23:34 UTC in a later collection commit — the regime never saw it).
  2. The heavy nightly build hits its timeout and is CANCELLED before the engine-outputs
     commit (see daily.yml:153), so the price data lands but the regime never re-stamps.
  3. STORE-BEHIND-MARKET: the nightly US collect commit itself races or fails (daily.yml's
     data push is non-fatal after 5 rebase attempts), so the yahoo/SPY store FREEZES a session
     behind the market — while a different store (massive) already holds the close. Modes 1-2 are
     "engine behind store"; this one is "store behind market", which the store-vs-engine check
     alone can NEVER see (both agree on the stale date). Fix: when the massive reference has
     advanced past yahoo/SPY, re-pull yahoo (keyless) before re-running the engine. (The 2026-07-03
     July-4-holiday incident: US yahoo froze at 07-01, regime stuck at 07-01, massive already 07-02.)

In all three cases data/regime/latest.json — which BOTH the macro.html "Current Macro Regime"
badge AND the Market State board read their as-of date from — is left behind the latest session,
so the dashboard shows a stale date (the "still showing 2026-06-30" report).

This is the FAST, cancellation-proof catch-up. It runs in the intraday fast-path (every
~30 min during RTH, plus a pre-open tick). When the store's last SPY close is newer than
latest.json's date — OR the store itself is behind the massive market reference (mode 3, healed
by a keyless yahoo re-pull) — it re-runs the regime engine (~25s, offline-safe — every leaf is
try/except wrapped) and re-persists the Market State snapshot. The fast-path then commits
ONLY those two small artifacts (data/regime/latest.json + data/market_state/latest.json);
the forward-grading logs engine.run also touches (regime_history.parquet, *_log.jsonl,
regime_one.json, base_effect_fwd.jsonl ...) are the NIGHTLY build's canonical once-per-session
writes and are deliberately NOT committed here, so intraday re-runs never pollute them.

Idempotent + non-fatal: exits 0 whether it refreshed, found the regime already fresh, or
hit an error (the fast-path must never fail because of the self-heal).
