"""Materialize the security master + the time-scoped vendor alias table (Data OS DOS-1.1).

WHAT THIS PRODUCES, AND WHY IT IS TWO FILES
-------------------------------------------
``data/reference/security_master.parquet``  one row per SECURITY — the stored,
authoritative ``security_id``.  ``lib/dataos/identity.py`` is the ALLOCATOR (a pure
derivation, no counter, no hash); this artifact is the AUTHORITY (the value that was
minted and stored).  ``research/MASTERMIND_SECURITY_MASTER_SPEC.md`` §4 states the
rule this script implements as code: **mint once and store** — a later correction to
inception facts appends an ALIAS, it never re-mints a stable id, because two ids for
one thing is the exact defect the spine exists to end.

``data/reference/vendor_aliases.parquet``  one row per
``(vendor, vendor_symbol, security_id, valid_from, valid_to)``, half-open in time:
``valid_from`` INCLUSIVE, ``valid_to`` EXCLUSIVE (spec §6;
``lib/dataos/identity.py::AliasRow``).  An inclusive end would make the changeover day
ambiguous, and 2026-01-14 is exactly the day the MMC/MRSH answer has to be
unambiguous.  It carries FIVE vendor spaces in TWO FAMILIES — three that answer "what
was it called THEN" and two that answer "what do I call it TODAY, for a bar of any
date".  Confusing those two is the seven-month MMC outage in a new costume, so the
families have different names and a test pins them apart; see the vendor block below.

``data/reference/_receipt.json``  ``code_version`` (git sha), per-input sha256, row
counts, ``generated_at``, and the coverage numbers.  Coverage is a REPORTED NUMBER,
never an asserted completeness: DOS-1.1's acceptance bullet is "N of M members
resolved, K unresolved, listed by name".

THE TWO RENAMES THIS EXISTS TO ANSWER
-------------------------------------
**MMC -> MRSH, 2026-01-14.**  Marsh McLennan changed its NYSE symbol; same listing,
same CUSIP (``lib/ticker_aliases.py`` module docstring).  Yahoo migrated the whole
history onto MRSH while ``scripts/fetch_basket_ohlcv`` carried only the FI->FISV
entry, so ``data/baskets/ohlcv/MMC.parquet`` came to never exist and the ``insurance``
basket rendered 18/19 members and ``us_sector_financials`` 75/76 for SEVEN MONTHS.
Nothing went red; the site simply drew one fewer line.  A timeless two-entry dict can
say "MMC means MRSH" but cannot say "MMC MEANT MMC before 2026-01-14", so a backfill
through it silently re-labels the past.  Both symbols resolve here to ONE id,
``SEC:US-XNYS-MMC``, and the table answers DIFFERENTLY either side of the boundary.

**SATS -> ECHO, 2026-06-24.**  EchoStar.  ``engine/ledger_identity.py`` module
docstring measures the live defect: ``data/signal_archive/track_record.parquet``
carries SATS 128 rows and ECHO 128 rows with IDENTICAL ``(date, type)`` key sets and
all 39 identity/entry columns byte-identical — one physical fire logged twice — so
every hit-rate, forward-return and drawdown statistic over that ledger DOUBLE-WEIGHTS
one name.  A table that knew MMC and not SATS would have reproduced the exact
fragmentation being fixed, so SATS is not optional here.

WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT DO
----------------------------
* It does not become an authority.  Nothing reads these artifacts yet except
  ``tests/test_dataos_security_master.py``; DOS-1.2 declares the seams, and the master
  becomes authority only at spec §11.4.  Display-tier accrual needs no gauntlet.
* It does not invent an inception DATE.  Spec §4: there is **no in-repo US listing-date
  source**, and back-dating one from a store's earliest bar would be a fabricated fact
  (``lib/symbol_directory_receipts.py`` forbids that class of synthesis outright).
  ``effective_at`` is therefore the earliest DATED OBSERVATION in this repo's committed
  seeds that the security existed — see :func:`_effective_at`.  It is NOT a listing date
  and must never be read as one.
* It does not resolve a venue by guessing.  ``KNOWN_MICS`` in
  ``lib/dataos/identity.py`` is closed on purpose; a symbol whose venue has no MIC
  there is reported UNRESOLVED by name rather than minted onto a guessed venue.
  Getting a MIC wrong mints a different, stable, wrong id — spec §5: "the one mistake
  this scheme cannot self-heal".
* It creates no new store, no control plane and no second identity reader
  (gate G4).  ``lib/dataos/identity.VendorAliasTable`` is the only reader, and this
  builder round-trips every alias row through it before writing, so an ambiguous table
  fails HERE rather than in a consumer.

# ── Vendors (symbol SPACES) — TWO CLOCKS, never one ───────────────────────────
# A "vendor" here is a symbol space, which is why several of them are this repo.
# Spec §6's column note lists `yahoo` … `nasdaq_symdir` … `exchange` as vendors; the
# repo's own stable key is the space every site surface, page slug and ledger row is
# written in, so it needs a name in the same table or the translation has no LHS.
#
# THE DISTINCTION THIS TABLE MUST NOT COLLAPSE (adversarial review, 2026-08-13).  A
# rename gives a security two names, and there are two DIFFERENT questions about them:
#
#   HISTORICAL NAMING — "what did this space call the security ON 2020-01-02?"  Answered
#     by a DATED pair straddling the changeover.  This is the question a backfill of a
#     dated archive asks, and the one a timeless dict cannot answer at all.
#   CURRENT CATALOG — "what string do I use TODAY to fetch or store this security's
#     series, for data of ANY date?"  Answered by ONE OPEN-BOUNDED row at today's
#     symbol, because the vendor and the store both migrated the WHOLE history onto the
#     new name — Yahoo serves Marsh's entire tape under MRSH and `data/stocks/ECHO.parquet`
#     holds EchoStar's spliced history back to 2008.
#
# Reading the historical answer as if it were the current one is the seven-month MMC
# outage in a new costume: a §11.4 backfill that requested "MMC" for 2020 because the
# table said Yahoo called it MMC then would get "possibly delisted, no price data found".
# So the two families are SEPARATE VENDOR SPACES with names that say which clock they
# run on, and `tests/test_dataos_security_master.py` pins them apart.

# ── historical-naming spaces (dated across a rename) ──
VENDOR_YAHOO = "yahoo"            # what Yahoo CALLED the security on a given day
VENDOR_MEMBERSHIP = "membership"  # what THIS REPO keyed it on that day (universe seeds)
VENDOR_LEDGER = "ledger"          # the per-ticker signal-archive key space on that day

# ── current-catalog spaces (one open-bounded row at today's symbol) ──
#: The string to REQUEST from Yahoo today, for a bar of ANY date.  Reproduces
#: `lib.ticker_aliases.fetch_symbol` exactly — the row family that lets this dataset
#: claim `supersedes: lib/ticker_aliases.py` without lying.
VENDOR_YAHOO_FETCH = "yahoo_fetch"
#: The key this repo's per-ticker stores and ledger rows carry today, for data of ANY
#: date — `lib.ticker_aliases.store_key`'s side of the same seam.  `data/stocks/`,
#: `data/baskets/ohlcv/` and `data/signal_archive/` rows written after a rename are all
#: keyed here, which is why a dedup over the archive has to ask THIS space, not `ledger`.
VENDOR_STORE = "store"

#: V4-D2B2-CN-HK — current-catalog space carrying the GMI node's OWN suffix-qualified
#: symbol spelling (``"000001.SZ"``, ``"1398.HK"``) exactly as ``source_native_symbol``
#: carries it (``engine/theme_graph/identity_resolution.py::_best_effort_symbol``).
#: The master's ``inception_code`` for CN/HK is always the BARE code (spec §3.1: CN 6
#: digits no suffix, HK 5 digits zero-padded), which never string-equals the suffixed
#: spelling — so every CN/HK resolution in ``gmi.identity_resolution/v1`` goes through
#: D2A rule 6 (``join_method=vendor_alias``), never rule 5's exact inception-code
#: match.  See :func:`mint_cn_hk_rows`.

      DATED PAIR straddling the rename.  The pair is what makes the table answer
      differently either side of the boundary, which is the whole deliverable.
    * CURRENT-CATALOG spaces (``yahoo_fetch``, ``store``) get ONE OPEN-BOUNDED row at
      today's symbol per security — or, since 2026-08-28 (AMENDMENT ruling 9 / m3), a
      DATED PAIR when a RenameEvent names the space in ``vendors`` AND the security is
      the renamed one (inception-code gate below): the repo's own stored key genuinely
      changed on a day (EQR->VMRK), and "what key did the repo file this under on date
      D" needs the boundary. Either way exactly ONE row is open-bounded per security,

    disclosure SHORT name, not a verified legal name, and it demonstrably changes
    over time in this exact committed data (sec_code 000430: "ST张家界" through
    2026-05-15, "张家界" from 2026-07-10 — a real ST-flag removal) — exactly why
    current-identity-only semantics (boundary 7) keep it out of any stored identity
    column rather than fabricating a historical name lineage.

    The ``exchange`` column (``collectors/china_filings.py::_parse_announcement``)
    records which CNInfo QUERY BATCH (``column=sse|szse``) returned the row, not a
    verified venue — sampled at the D2B2 pin, SZSE-range codes (300xxx, 002xxx) were
    filed under ``exchange="sse"``.  This function never reads it; venue (SH/SZ/BJ
    board) is derived deterministically from the CODE ITSELF via
    ``lib.dataos.identity.normalize_cn_symbol``/``cn_board`` (already spec-mandated,
    never trusted from this collector's own labelling).

    Returns ``({6-digit code: {"effective_at": "YYYY-MM-DD"}}, newest publish date
    seen)``.  ``effective_at`` is the EARLIEST dated observation in this committed
    window — the same "not a listing date" convention :func:`_effective_at` states
    for the US stage — and the window itself is a forward-accruing recent slice
    (the collector's own docstring: "forward-only"), so a code absent here is
    "no evidence YET", never "not a real listing" (a coverage limitation, disclosed
    in the receipt, never asserted as completeness — this module's own "Coverage is
    a REPORTED NUMBER, never an asserted completeness").

    :func:`mint_master_rows` (boundary 3: canonical builder only, no parallel
    allocator, no hand-written master rows).  Every target finishes RESOLVED (a new
    master row + a current-catalog vendor-alias row) or a NAMED typed refusal
    (``no_committed_primary_source_evidence`` / ``unparseable_symbol``) — boundary 8,
    no silent drop.

    ``listing_key``/``security_id`` are minted via ``lib.dataos.identity``'s
    EXISTING, already-spec'd CN/HK grammars (``normalize_cn_symbol``,
    ``normalize_hk_symbol``) — no new allocator, no new grammar (boundary 3).

    Conservative by design (boundary 4, D2B1 issuer law preserved): every new row
    mints with ``issuer_state=None`` (unstamped), exactly like a brand-new US row in
    :func:`mint_master_rows`.  The CALLER's subsequent ``apply_issuer_correction``
    pass (run unmodified, over the full accumulated row set) settles it to
    ``NO_ISSUER_EVIDENCE`` — the US SEC CIK map has no CN/HK entries, so every one of
    these rows lands there this era.  NO issuer-grouping evidence class is
    introduced for CN/HK: CNInfo's ``org_id`` / HK's ``stock_name`` are consulted
    only as EXISTENCE evidence to decide whether to mint at all, never for issuer
    identity.  This trivially satisfies boundary 6 (A/H pairs — e.g. ICBC
    ``SEC:CN-XSHG-601398`` / ``SEC:HK-XHKG-01398`` — stay separate securities,
    sharing an issuer only on deterministic evidence; there is none here, so none is
    ever inferred) and keeps boundary 4 fully intact (no foreign identifier —
    USCC/org_id/exchange code — is ever promoted to canonical identity; Mastermind
    ids remain canonical).

    A vendor-alias row (``vendor=VENDOR_THEME_GRAPH_NATIVE``, open-bounded
    current-catalog) is emitted for every minted row, carrying the GMI node's OWN
    suffix-qualified symbol spelling — see :data:`VENDOR_THEME_GRAPH_NATIVE`'s
    docstring for why this makes vendor-alias resolution (D2A rule 6) the ordinary
    path for every admission here, not a special "alias-only" case.

    Mint-once/idempotent: a seed whose rendered listing key already has a row in
    ``master_rows`` (a prior run's mint, present via ``_read_existing``) is skipped
    outright — this stage never touches, corrects or re-derives a previously-minted

    claimant survives into the mint/alias pipeline; every other is dropped from
    ``resolutions`` entirely and returned as a typed, disclosed exclusion (R2's
    third accounting bucket).  Generalized beyond keys that were already ACTIVE
    pre-run (the D2B2-US v1 shape, which only caught a stale duplicate graph node
    under an old ticker spelling next to the current one — ``co:us:FISV`` beside
    ``co:us:FI``): a reviewer counterexample showed two codes sharing a root can
    ALSO collide on a brand-NEW key (a from-scratch NEWA/NEWAOLD pair), which the
    v1 guard never saw because it only inspected pre-run-active keys.  Left
    uncollapsed, ``build_alias_rows`` would independently contribute an
    open-bounded historical alias row for EACH claimant, which
    ``VendorAliasTable``'s own uniqueness law correctly refuses at construction
    (AMENDMENT ruling 6, D2B1-R1) — this function makes that state structurally
    unreachable rather than catching it after the fact.

    AMENDMENT R14 (fix pass 2, finding 13) — this mechanism must NEVER drop a
    LEGACY resolution: when >=2 LEGACY-universe claimants render one key (the
    D2B1-R1 dated-alias EQR/VMRK shape is exactly this — BOTH the pre-rename and
    post-rename symbol stay live universe keys ON PURPOSE), this function does
    NOT collapse them at all — every claimant flows through unchanged, exactly
    as it did pre-D2B2-US, and ``mint_master_rows``'s OWN existing collision
    handling (the ``minted_by``/``prior`` current-symbol-agreement check, H2)
    is what dedups them.  Collapsing here would itself become the "silently
    dropping a legacy resolution" violation R1's absolute law forbids.

    Collapse applies ONLY when at least one claimant is GMI-only.  Winner
    selection, in priority order:
      1. a LEGACY-universe claimant ALWAYS wins over a GMI-only one when
         exactly one legacy claimant is present — R1's "legacy mint law is
         untouched, regardless of master state" is an absolute law this NEW
         mechanism must not itself violate by dropping the legacy claimant.
      2. among GMI-only claimants only (no legacy claimant present), the one
         whose OWN key equals the resolved row's CURRENT symbol
         (:func:`_current_symbol` of the shared inception code) — "what do we
         call this today" is the natural winner.
      3. otherwise the lexicographically smallest GMI-only key, deterministic.

    Returns ``(kept_resolutions, disclosures)``.  Every disclosure names the
    dropped symbol, its rendered listing key, and the winning symbol — never a
    silent drop.  A dropped claimant is ALWAYS GMI-only; a legacy claimant is
    never named in ``disclosures``.

    pending_transition_refusals, lost_rows, exception_lost_rows,
    gmi_eligibility_refusals)`` — existing ids never move.  ``lost_rows``/
    ``exception_lost_rows`` are :func:`_compute_lost`'s ``(fence_lost,
    exception_lost)`` pair (AMENDMENT ruling 3 / M1) — the fence gates on
    ``lost_rows`` only; ``exception_lost_rows`` is disclosed by the caller as typed
    ``listing_continuity`` entries, never silently dropped.

    V4-D2B2-US §3/§4 — ``gmi_admission_targets``/``directory_flags`` gate a genuine
    NEW mint (below) for a GMI-seeded candidate through
    :func:`_gmi_us_eligibility_refusal` (structural common-equity flags + registrant-
    CIK-mandatory-for-minting).  Both default to empty, so a caller that never passes
    them (every pre-D2B2-US call site) sees byte-identical behavior — this gate is
    consulted ONLY for a key present in ``gmi_admission_targets``, never for a
    legacy-universe candidate (§3's "legacy universe seed behavior is unchanged").

    The join back into a committed master is by ``listing_key``: the master's grain is
    the security, and it deliberately carries no membership-key column (that belongs to
    the alias table).  A stored row therefore wins on EVERY column, including a
    ``security_id`` that no longer matches what the derivation would produce today —
    that is precisely "mint once and store", and re-deriving it would be a re-mint.

    A correction that changes the INCEPTION CODE cannot be detected here (it changes the
    listing key, so it reads as a new security).  Per §D2 that correction is expressed
    by APPENDING an alias, never by rewriting a master row — and this builder never
    deletes a row it did not re-derive, so nothing is silently dropped either.

    ``issuer_id`` is deliberately NOT minted here (V4-D2B1 §2/§3): a brand-new row
    starts with ``issuer_id=None`` and no issuer axis — the abolished per-listing
    mint fallback.  :func:`apply_issuer_correction`, run once over the FULL returned
    row set, is the only place an issuer_id is ever assigned or repointed.  Every row
    read from ``existing`` is tagged ``_existed_before`` (an in-memory marker only —
    never a declared column, never written to parquet) so the era stage can tell a
    genuine issuer_id VALUE CHANGE (migration-worthy) from a brand-new mint's first
    assignment (not a migration: there was no prior stored value to migrate from).

    V4-D2B1-R1 §3.4 + §5 — TWO new refusal classes, both non-fatal and disclosed,
    never a silent mint:

    * **resurrection refusal (H8).**  A resolution whose rendered listing key hits an
      EXISTING row that is ``security_state``-superseded (a tombstone) never resolves
      to that superseded id — reuse of a superseded listing key needs a future
      ratified identity-break record (GOLD precedent), not an automatic rejoin.
    * **pending-transition fence (§5.2).**  A would-be NEW mint (a listing-key MISS)
      is refused when the committed master has unaccounted-for active rows this run
      (``lost``, §5.1) AND the candidate lacks independent registrant evidence (a
      current CIK map entry for the candidate whose CIK differs from every lost row's
      ``issuer_cik``).  A rename covered by :data:`RENAME_EVENTS` never reaches this
      branch at all — it already resolved to an existing row above.  An empty ``lost``
      set, or independent CIK evidence, lets the mint proceed (H7: IPOs are not
      collateral damage).

        stays/becomes ``NO_ISSUER_EVIDENCE``, issuer_id UNCHANGED (legacy value
        retained for a pre-era row; stays ``None`` for a brand-new row — never a fresh
        per-listing mint, the abolished fallback).  Byte-stable when nothing changed.
      * the join hits and the row's OWN committed issuer_id (if any) agrees with, or
        is silent on (null), the CIK group's canonical id -> ``RESOLVED``, issuer_id
        set to the group's canonical id (adopted from an existing evidenced group, or

        exactly one member, so the canonical id IS the row's own pre-existing value —
        no visible change, only the evidentiary status becomes explicit (spec §2).

        issuer_id (a re-examined ``NO_ISSUER_EVIDENCE`` row whose legacy value points
        at a different group than the fresh evidence would) -> ``EVIDENCE_CONFLICT``,

    refinement carve-out (see below). Fail-closed by design: the pre-amendment code
    silently dropped ANY overlapping committed row (whether it pointed at a
    superseded id or not), which is an undisclosed last-write-wins replacement on an
    append-only dataset — exactly the M5 defect. A genuine correction to an ACTIVE
    row's alias history that does NOT qualify for the carve-out is a curation act (a
    new RENAME_EVENTS/SECURITY_SUPERSESSIONS entry, or an operator resolving the
    conflict by hand), never something this builder silently resolves.

    TWO lawful deletion classes now exist (:func:`_prune_stale_aliases` documents
    both in full): the original superseded-``security_id`` tombstone prune, and the
    AMENDMENT §2 same-id-refinement carve-out (implemented 2026-08-29) — a fresh
    DATED family pointing at the SAME still-active ``security_id`` that exactly
    tiles the full time axis, with the family row COVERING the committed row's own
    start date carrying its ``vendor_symbol`` (start-anchored, see
    :func:`_is_lawful_same_id_refinement`), is a lawful REFINEMENT of a committed

    different symbol, or a fresh row naming a DIFFERENT security_id — still raises
    exactly as before, and the raised message names the SPECIFIC failed condition
    (or the specific different-``security_id`` row).

    AMENDMENT ruling 11 (§3): a plain ``Exception``, NEVER ``SystemExit`` — the
    pre-amendment class subclassed ``SystemExit``, which is a ``BaseException``
    sibling to ``Exception`` and therefore escaped :func:`run_nightly_refresh`'s
    ``except Exception`` handler entirely (a real MAJOR regression: the nightly seam's
    "always returns 0" invariant broke, ``_restore_artifacts`` never ran, and NOT ONE
    ``::warning`` was emitted — silent process-exit-1 on exactly the future
    dated-rename path AMENDMENT §2 documents will fire). :func:`run_nightly_refresh`
    catches this class EXPLICITLY, before its generic handler (see there); the CLI
    path (:func:`main`) still stays fail-closed because nothing there catches it at
    all — an uncaught ``Exception`` propagating out of ``main()`` is still a non-zero

    string naming the FIRST failed condition — checked in this fixed order,

    itself (e) is known to be well-formed.

    ``family`` is every FRESH row sharing ``ex_row``'s ``(vendor, security_id)``.

    a. ``ex_row`` is OPEN-ENDED (``valid_to is None``) — a fully dated committed row

    b. (same id) — enforced by the CALLER: every fresh row that overlaps ``ex_row``
       must share ``ex_row.security_id`` before this predicate even runs (a
       different-id overlap is reported by name, never folded into this reason);
       ``family`` is already scoped to ``ex_row.security_id`` by construction.
    c. DATED — no row in ``family`` may be fully open (``valid_from is None and
       valid_to is None``); a single undated replacement row is not a citable
       refinement.
    (width) — no row in ``family`` may have zero or negative width
       (``valid_from is not None and valid_to is not None and valid_from >= valid_to``);
       a degenerate row can neither tile the axis nor meaningfully "cover" a point,
       and admitting one would make the tiling check below order-dependent.
    e. Full-axis tiling — sorted DETERMINISTICALLY (``valid_from`` ascending with
       ``None`` first, THEN ``valid_to`` ascending with ``None`` last as the
       tie-break — two rows sharing one ``valid_from`` never depend on input
       order), exactly one row is open at the start, exactly one is open at the

       next.valid_from``): gapless and overlap-free across the whole axis.

    d. Start-anchored symbol continuity — REPLACES the original era-blind rule

       let a family whose EARLY leg happened to share the committed row's symbol
       excuse pruning a row that, at ITS OWN start date, the family actually maps

       ``(yahoo, ABC, sec, 2020-01-01, None)`` against a family whose current
       (post-2010) leg is ``DEF`` must still raise, even though an ``ABC`` leg

    repair corrects.

    TWO deletion classes, narrowly scoped (AMENDMENT ruling 6 REMOVES the prior
    "ambiguity-conflicting" class 2, which silently dropped ANY committed row

    undisclosed last-write-wins replacement on an append-only dataset):

    * **Superseded security_id** (``prune_class="superseded_tombstone"``).  Any row
      minted for a security this run tombstoned (V4-D2B1-R1 §3) is categorically
      wrong — VMRK's alias rows must converge onto EQR's family (§3.7), never keep

    * **Same-id refinement** (``prune_class="same_id_refinement"``, AMENDMENT §2
      carve-out, implemented 2026-08-29).  A fresh candidate that overlaps a
      committed row pointing at a still-ACTIVE ``security_id`` is not automatically a

      ``security_id`` and belongs to a DATED same-id family that exactly tiles the
      full time axis (no gaps, no overlaps) with the family row COVERING the
      committed row's own start date carrying its ``vendor_symbol`` (the
      start-anchored rule — see :func:`_is_lawful_same_id_refinement` for the full
      ordered condition list), the committed open-bounded row is a stale
      pre-refinement artifact, not a genuine ambiguity: it is pruned, not raised.
      EVERY open-ended committed row that the SAME lawful family refines is pruned
      (plural) — a family can legitimately extend past more than one prior
      committed link in one run (see the chained-refinement unit test). A single
      UNDATED replacement row, a zero/negative-width row, a gapped/overlapping
      tiling, a fully DATED committed row, a family whose start-covering leg names
      a different symbol, or ANY overlapping fresh row naming a DIFFERENT
      ``security_id`` still falls through to the fail-closed raise below exactly
      as before this carve-out.

    Every deletion in EITHER class is named in ``pruned`` (tagged with its
    ``prune_class``) — the caller receipts it (``vendor_alias_prunes`` + a dedicated
    ``::warning`` per class), never a silent drop.

    A fresh row that overlaps a committed row pointing at an ACTIVE id, and is not
    excused by the carve-out above, is a fail-closed :class:`VendorAliasPruneConflict`

      (b) inputs unchanged since the last generation -> byte-stable no-op,
          ``generated_at`` NOT re-stamped;
      (c) inputs advanced -> regenerate, stamp, receipt pins the exact snapshot ids
          consumed.

    A source failure can never produce a falsely fresh identity generation (§23.24):
    the real (writing) build always runs first into ``out_dir``, and its output is
    then compared byte-for-byte against what was there before — if nothing besides
    the receipt's own wall-clock stamp changed, or if the run surfaced a config
    defect (an unmodelled rename / listing-key collision, the two things
    ``receipt['notes']`` ever carries), every artifact including the receipt is
    restored to its prior bytes.  Non-fatal throughout: this function always returns
    0 — a nightly step must never fail the collect job over an identity refresh.

    Law (a) covers THREE distinct identity inputs, all refused pre-flight (never left
    to ``build()``): the ``required`` seed/config files above, the ``CIK_MAP_DIR``
    evidence rail (escape #11), and the ``SYMBOL_DIR_SNAPSHOTS`` listing rail (V4-D2B1

    an empty mapping when their directory is missing/empty/unreadable (correct for the
    one-shot ``build()``/``main()`` CLI path, where "no evidence yet" is a valid state
    to mint from — hardened for THAT path too, see ``allow_missing_evidence`` on
    :func:`build`), which would otherwise let the nightly regenerate a falsely fresh
    artifact: an empty CIK map mints every row ``NO_ISSUER_EVIDENCE``, and an empty
    listing-snapshots dir starves ``resolve_universe`` of any venue evidence at all,
    collapsing coverage toward zero while still returning a clean receipt with no
