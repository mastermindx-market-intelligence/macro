"""Build data/marketing/theme_proxy_map.json — the theme -> proxy-cashtag map.

The offline half of the design documented in ``engine/marketing/theme_proxy``.
This script does the expensive, auditable work once (read every ETF holdings
store, correlate every theme's members over 252 sessions) and writes a small
artifact the publish-time lane can read for free.

WHY OFFLINE. Post time knows one thing the builder cannot — which eight names
showed up on today's card — and the builder knows two things post time cannot
afford: the holdings of 75 funds and a 252-day correlation matrix per theme.
Splitting on that line keeps the render/publish path cheap AND makes the decision
auditable: the committed map IS the receipt for every tag that ships.

WHAT IT WRITES, per theme:
  * ``candidates``     — proxies ordered most-traded-first, each carrying the
                         constituent list + weights that leg 3 is checked against
  * ``diagnostic_cohesion_rho`` — mean pairwise correlation across the theme's
                         FULL membership. Named ``diagnostic_`` because it is NOT
                         the gate input and must never become one: the finviz
                         taxonomy is mega-cap polluted and sprawling, so
                         "Commodities Metals" spans gold, silver, copper, steel,
                         aluminium and lithium and scores 0.39 across all 51
                         names, while the eight precious-metals rows that
                         actually shipped score 0.81. An earlier draft of this
                         script gated on the theme-wide number and refused all 40
                         themes — including the one the operator asked for.
                         Cohesion is measured at post time on the card's own
                         rows; see ``engine.marketing.theme_proxy.cohesion``.

SELECTION IS NOT ASSERTION. Equity candidates are DERIVED: any stored fund that
holds enough of the theme's members is a candidate, and the gate does the
rejecting at post time against the live card. The only hand-authored input is
:data:`DECLARED` — the commodity/asset-class links, which no holdings file can
express because a bullion fund holds metal rather than miners.

Usage:
    python -m scripts.build_theme_proxy_map            # write the map
    python -m scripts.build_theme_proxy_map --dry-run  # print the table only

#: These cannot be derived: a bullion ETF's holdings are metal, so it shares no
#: constituent with any equity theme and every holdings test scores it zero.
#: The link is an economic one (the miners are levered to the metal), it is
#: reviewed by a human, and it still has to clear the reach and cohesion legs at
#: post time like any other candidate.
#:
#: Operator ruling 2026-08-05, on whether the copy must explain the difference:
#: "When gold goes up, its miners go up, its that simple, don't need to
#: overcomplicate and shit." So the class is recorded here for the audit trail
#: and changes nothing about how the tag reads in the post.
#:
#: NOT included, deliberately: ``$GOLD`` and ``$SILVER``. ``GOLD`` is not a live
#: ticker — it is absent from the 2,655-name cashtag universe because Barrick
#: renamed to ``$B``, so the cashtag is a stale-ticker collision carrying another
#: company's history; ``SILVER`` was never a US ticker. Both still resolve to X
#: search surfaces, which makes them a real reach question, but they are
#: non-instruments: no price, no card row, and nothing the engine can verify.
#: They stay out until an operator asks for a non-instrument tag class by name.

#: A fund needs at least this many of a theme's members before it is even
