"""scripts/prophet_lab_baseline.py — mint the Prophet Operator Lab's
observation-baseline marker (LAB-0 §6 step 3, "Radar live commissioning";
`research/prophet_v4/LAB0_B5_RECUT_OPERATOR_LAB_2026-08-18.md` §4/§6).

WHAT THIS MARKER IS AND WHY MINTING IT IS DANGEROUS TO GET WRONG
------------------------------------------------------------------
`engine/prophet_lab/observation.py`'s honesty rule: with NO baseline marker,
every event the Lab shows is `retrospective_seed` (fail-honest default). Once
a baseline exists, an event is `live_forward` — genuinely new, evidence-
eligible, eligible for a measured Lab->Prophet lead — only when its FIRST
OBSERVED spool `pass_ts` falls at or after `baseline_started_at` AND the
spool's own earliest surviving envelope reaches back at least that far
(`engine.prophet_lab.sources.baseline_coverage_verified`, the S1 fail-CLOSED
check). That second half is the trap this CLI exists to close: a baseline
minted BEFORE any real spooled pass exists has no coverage evidence to verify
against, so `baseline_coverage_verified` degrades to `False` and every event
STAYS `retrospective_seed` forever -- a Lab that looks provisioned but is
permanently all-seed, with no error anywhere to say so.

So this CLI REFUSES to mint unless it can read at least one real spooled
pass with a `pass_ts` it can parse to a tz-aware instant (never a naive one
-- `engine.prophet_lab.timeparse.parse_instant`'s fail-closed contract,
unchanged and NOT weakened here), and the marker it mints,
`baseline_started_at`, is always "now" -- a timestamp STRICTLY AFTER the
LATEST pass_ts actually observed (which, since the latest is by definition
never earlier than the earliest, is also strictly after the earliest -- the
two are not independent conditions; only the latest needs checking). The
very first read back through the API therefore already has verifiable
coverage.

HOST REQUIREMENT: run this ON THE SAME HOST as the spool WRITER (the live
5-min evaluator / pack builder), not from an operator's laptop or a CI
runner. "Now" is this process's OWN wall clock, and `baseline_started_at`'s
entire safety property rests on that clock genuinely postdating the writer's
most recent `pass_ts` -- a skewed clock on a different machine can silently
violate that. See the skew check below, and the commissioning runbook.

TRANSPORT
---------
Reads through `engine.prophet_lab.sources.resolve_radar_spool` -- the exact
R2-first-else-local ladder the production API uses (`engine.entry_radar.spool`
under the hood), never a second, divergent read path. `--spool-dir` overrides
the local fallback half; production credentials (`$R2_ENDPOINT`/
`$R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`$R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) are read from the environment,
same as the API process.

WRITE TARGET
------------
`$PROPHET_LAB_OBSERVATION_BASELINE_PATH` (or `--baseline-path`) -- a
runtime/state-plane file the API server reads, e.g.
`/var/lib/macro-live/state/prophet_lab/observation_baseline.json`. Never a
`data/` path: this is operator-provisioned Lab state, not a nightly ledger
(nightly is the sole `data/` advancer, house law, unrelated to this file).

An EXISTING valid marker is never silently overwritten -- `--remint` is
required (S5): an accidental second `--write` would otherwise reset every
event observed since the original baseline back to `retrospective_seed`,
destroying accrued live_forward history with no undo.

USAGE
-----
    python3 scripts/prophet_lab_baseline.py                     # dry run (default)
    python3 scripts/prophet_lab_baseline.py --write              # actually mint
    python3 scripts/prophet_lab_baseline.py --spool-dir /var/lib/macro-live/state/entry_radar/spool \\
        --baseline-path /var/lib/macro-live/state/prophet_lab/observation_baseline.json --write
    python3 scripts/prophet_lab_baseline.py --write --remint      # deliberate re-mint over an existing marker

Exit 0 on a successful dry-run report OR a successful mint; exit 1 on any
refusal (no baseline path configured, no readable spooled pass, a
zero/negative clock-skew ordering violation, a large positive skew without
--allow-stale-source, an existing marker without --remint, or a pre-publish
consistency check failure).
