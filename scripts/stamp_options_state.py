"""scripts/stamp_options_state.py — nightly options-state stamping on the US board ledger.

Options Alpha program W1.3 / W-C (research/OPTIONS_ALPHA_MASTERPLAN.md, rulings A6/A9/A10;
W-C 2026-07-05 extends with skew/ivspread/opex/wall-dist/pin-risk columns).
Extended by P2.2 (research/LIVE_FLOW_PRODUCTION_ROADMAP_BY_FABLE.md §3 P2.2) to add four
tape-flow stamp columns from engine/tape_flow_stamp.py.
Extended by W-OVC (2026-07-17) to add opt_vanna_relief, opt_front7_charm_share,
opt_root_class — see OPTIONS_OPEX_VANNA_CHARM_ADJUDICATION.md §5 build docket.

Runs AFTER ``scripts.grade_us_board --nightly`` in the daily.yml render job (see the
"US Buy Board ledger" step). Given the freshly-graded + accumulated
``data/us_board_ledger/retro_grades.parquet``, it adds the nullable options-state and
tape-flow stamp columns (``engine.options_stamp.STAMP_COLS`` +
``engine.tape_flow_stamp.TAPE_FLOW_STAMP_COLS``) to any row that is not yet stamped and
writes the frame back.

DESIGN — mirrors ``grade_us_board._backfill_regime_stamps`` exactly (the established
schema-union / PIT-stamp pattern):

  * schema-union: missing stamp columns are added (None) so legacy rows keep nulls.
  * no-overwrite: a column family already stamped on a row is never overwritten
    (backfill-does-not-overwrite-non-null; a later re-run is idempotent).
  * PIT: readers in both stamp modules use only store data with as-of ≤ the fire's
    ``as_of`` date. No lookahead.

TWO INDEPENDENT STAMP FAMILIES, each with its OWN retry gate (merge of W-C + P2.2):

  * options-state family (W1.3 + W-C cols): a row is retryable while ALL
    ``STAMP_COVERAGE_COLS`` are null.  opt_opex_days is intentionally EXCLUDED from the
    gate — it is calendar-derived and non-null on essentially every valid business date,
    so counting it would permanently lock opex-only rows out of future
    GEX/skew/ivspread fills (the W-C retry-gate fix).
  * tape-flow family (P2.2 cols): a row is retryable while ANY
    ``TAPE_FLOW_STAMP_COLS`` is null, and the commit is PER COLUMN, fill-null-only
    (2026-08-04).  The family-wide commit this replaces wrote all four columns as soon
    as one was non-null, so the first computable column (usually opt_dte_quality, which
    needs a single store row) locked the two 20-obs-gated columns at null forever — the
    same defect class as the W-C retry-gate fix above, one family over.  Rows frozen
    before the fix stay honest nulls (their PIT inputs are frozen), but a store repair or
    backfill can now heal whichever cells it actually touches.  A non-null cell is never
    overwritten.

  The gates are independent so one family's coverage never locks the other out.

W-C additions: the stamp_ledger pass pre-loads the skew and ivspread snapshot frames
once per run (avoiding repeated parquet reads per row) and passes them into
stamp_options_state as ``skew_df`` / ``ivspread_df``. These frames are absent locally
(gitignored R2 stores) → None is passed → all W-C cols stamp null. Coverage is printed.

This script NEVER touches grading columns or grading logic — Setup-Species Stage B owns
those (A9). It only unions in the ``opt_*`` columns. Backfill covers every existing row in
the 2026-06-15+ window (where chains/summaries exist); rows outside coverage stamp to null
and are re-tried on future runs (cheap; the coverage window only grows).

P2.2 tape-flow columns (opt_net_signed_prem_5d_z, opt_flow_breadth_group, opt_dte_quality,
opt_crowding_flag) are null-heavy, and two of them will stay 0% into late 2026. Measured
2026-08-04: the tape_flow store's first rows are 2026-07-10 (not 07-05), and per-root
accrual is ~WEEKLY, not nightly — the T2a forward mode budget-rotates a ~360-root universe
with resume-from-last, and the step self-skips on runner hosts without the ThetaData
Terminal (~2/5 nights in daily.yml). ``opt_net_signed_prem_5d_z`` and ``opt_crowding_flag``
each carry a 20-prior-observation PIT gate, so they stay null until a root has 20 store rows
strictly before a fire's as_of — ~Oct 2026 as_of dates at the measured cadence (median 5
rows/root over 15 sessions), vs ~4 weeks at true nightly cadence. This is correct behaviour
— the W1.3 precedent: nullable, retry-as-coverage-grows. Full per-column coverage map and
start dates: data/us_board_ledger/README.md.

NOTE: opt_iv_rank_252 remains always-null (ruling A9). It reads data/thetadata_eod greeks,
which is mid-backfill and has a known dedup defect (#1363). That wiring waits for the dedup
repair and manifest-complete confirmation before being wired here.

REPAIR — ``--restamp-positional`` (2026-07-30, the #3721 weekend-row class):
the chain/summary readers in engine/options_stamp.py slice their stores POSITIONALLY, and
until 2026-07-30 neither store was session-filtered, so every value derived from a
positional window was computed over a window containing fabricated non-session entries
(``chains/`` was 11 non-session files of 40; ``summary_*`` 26.3% non-session rows). The
readers are fixed, but the no-overwrite rule means already-stamped rows keep the wrong
values FOREVER: the retry gate opens only when ALL ``STAMP_COVERAGE_COLS`` are null, and
on the 241 affected ledger rows ``opt_gamma_regime`` / ``opt_wall_up`` / ``opt_wall_down``
/ ``opt_iv30`` / ``opt_voi_flag`` are all non-null — nulling just the positional columns
makes 0 of 241 rows eligible.

``--restamp-positional`` re-opens the options family for rows that already carry a
``_POSITIONAL_WINDOW_COLS`` value and lets the ORDINARY pass recompute them, so the
cross-sectional ``opt_vanna_relief`` tercile is rebuilt by the same tested code rather than
a parallel implementation. It is non-destructive by construction: in this mode a freshly
computed None NEVER overwrites an existing non-null, so running it on a machine where the
gitignored stores are absent is a no-op rather than a data loss. Run it once, where the
stores live, after the session filter lands.

REPAIR — ``--restamp-cols`` (2026-08-07, the era-scoping instrument):
``--restamp-positional`` re-opens the ORDINARY pass, so it writes the WHOLE options family,
not the columns the repair was authorised for.  Measured against the post-#4883 store on
2026-08-07: scoping the run to the three chain-derived columns moves 319 cells, while the
same run unscoped moves 1,713 across 14 columns — the other 1,394 are the ordinary pass
riding along (retry-gate fills the nightly would make anyway, plus summary-derived columns
that are stale for their OWN reason).  Since nightly is the sole advancer of forward
ledgers, an era-marked repair commit must carry ONLY its own cause; ``--restamp-cols``
restricts BOTH the row gate and the write set to the named columns and runs nothing else —
no ordinary fill, no opex/root_class dedicated write, no tape-flow family, no vanna tercile.
Everything it does not name is left for the nightly.  Same per-row compute path as the
ordinary pass (``stamp_options_state``), never a parallel implementation.

REPAIR — ``--backfill-ovc`` (2026-08-02, registry defect opex-vanna-charm-wovc):
from the W-OVC build (2026-07-17) to 2026-08-02, ``opt_root_class`` had NO write path
(excluded from ``STAMP_COVERAGE_COLS`` like ``opt_opex_days``, but without the dedicated
write ``opt_opex_days`` has) and ``opt_front7_charm_share`` was computed against the pruned
default chain reader, whose column list lacked ``expiry``/``T``/``iv`` — so
``_ovc_from_chain``'s required-column check silently returned null on every nightly call.
Both paths are fixed (dedicated root_class write below; reader widened in
engine/options_stamp.py); ``--backfill-ovc`` repairs the already-stamped rows the retry
gate can no longer reach. The ``_twin_silent_null_guard`` tripwire now makes this failure
class loud: a stamp column 100% null in the ledger while its display-store twin is
populated prints a ::warning on every nightly pass, and tests/test_options_stamp.py
enforces the same invariant on the committed parquets at PR time.

Idempotent, resilient: if the ledger is absent this is a no-op.

    COVERAGE FLOOR (2026-08-06).  A tercile is a CROSS-SECTIONAL statement — "top third
    of the market's vanna hedge pressure" — so it means something only when the ranked
    names actually represent the measurable universe.  Since the 5-session basis became
    calendar-resolved (``options_stamp._row_n_sessions_back``) it returns None on a store
    gap, and a gap at the ONE session the basis needs is store-WIDE, not per-name: every
    name reads the same store on the same schedule.  Measured over the committed store,
    as_of 2026-07-13 / 07-22 / 07-24 collapse from 355–375 ranked names to exactly 5 (the
    handful whose store happens to hold that session) while every other date ranks
    99.7–100% of them.

    A bare ``len(vals) >= 3`` still FIRES on those five, silently redefining "top tercile
    of the market" as "top tercile of 5 coverage-selected names": the threshold moves
    +21,153 → −850 at as_of 2026-07-22 and +15,516 → −850 at 07-24, admitting names
    nowhere near the true top third.  That is not a null; it is a gate whose meaning
    changed.

    The survivors are worse than a biased sample — they are DEAD STORES.  The threshold
    lands on exactly −850.1826 on all three dates because the same five names survive
    every time (ALM, BLD, CRML, NB, PPTA), and they survive precisely because their
    stores stopped updating on 2026-07-02: a frozen store trivially "has" the 5-back
    session because its whole tail predates the gap.  Without this floor the market's
    top tercile would be defined by five stores publishing a three-week-old reading.

    So below the floor the date is simply not ranked and the flag stays null (nulls
    printed).  Coverage is ranked ÷ MEASURABLE, never ÷ the whole board: a name with no
    options history was never a candidate, and counting it would refuse to rank on
    perfectly healthy dates.  The healthy and collapsed populations sit ~70× apart
    (99.7% vs 1.3%), so a 50% floor is nowhere near either of them.

    ``restamp_positional`` (default False) additionally re-opens the options-state family

    recomputed by this same pass against the now session-filtered stores (module header
    REPAIR). In that mode a freshly computed None never overwrites an existing non-null,
    so the repair cannot destroy data when a store is absent. Default behaviour is
    unchanged: no-overwrite, and a re-run stamps nothing.

    Eligibility is per family (see module header):

      * options-state family: ALL ``STAMP_COVERAGE_COLS`` null → retryable.  A row is
        committed for this family only when the stamp produces at least one non-null
        coverage-gated value.  opt_opex_days (calendar-derived) is always written when
        available but never flips the row to "stamped" — future runs can still fill the
        coverage-gated cols (W-C retry-gate fix).
      * tape-flow family: ANY ``TAPE_FLOW_STAMP_COLS`` null → retryable, and each column
        commits on its own (fill-null-only).  A computable column therefore never freezes
        a still-null sibling, and a non-null cell is never overwritten.

    ``n_newly_stamped`` counts rows where at least one family committed values
    (opex-only writes do not count).

    Stamps are cached per (as_of, ticker) since a board can list a name in several
    lanes/horizons — the options state is identical for all of them.

    W-C: skew and ivspread snapshot DataFrames are loaded once per call (not per row)
    and passed into stamp_options_state to avoid repeated parquet reads.  When these
    stores are absent locally (gitignored R2) the frames are None and the W-C stamp
    columns stay null — this is correct and expected (they will be filled on the R2
    runner where the stores are present).

    The tape-flow stamp (P2.2) adds opt_flow_breadth_group, which requires knowing the
    full group (sector peers on the same as_of date). The group is derived from the ledger

    From the W-OVC build (2026-07-17) to 2026-08-02 neither column ever reached the
    ledger: opt_root_class had no write path at all (excluded from STAMP_COVERAGE_COLS,
    and unlike opt_opex_days no dedicated write existed), and opt_front7_charm_share was
    computed against the pruned default chain reader whose column list lacked
    expiry/T/iv, so _ovc_from_chain's required-column check silently nulled it on every
    call.  Both write paths are now fixed for FUTURE rows; this pass repairs the rows
    already stamped while the paths were dead.

    Scope — deliberately narrower than the ordinary pass:

      * opt_root_class: filled wherever null.  Taxonomy-derived from the ticker alone,
        excluded from the coverage gate, so writing it can never lock a row out of
        future retries (same contract as opt_opex_days).
      * opt_front7_charm_share: filled ONLY on rows where the options-state family has
        already committed (≥1 STAMP_COVERAGE_COLS non-null — the gate is closed and the
        ordinary pass can never reach them again).  Rows still retryable are LEFT ALONE:
        front7 is itself a coverage column, so writing it on an all-null row would close
        the retry gate and permanently lock out the summary/skew/ivspread columns that a
        future run could fill.  Those rows get front7 from the fixed ordinary pass at
        their normal commit time.
      * opt_vanna_relief: NOT touched.  Its write path always worked (211/2282), and its
        cross-sectional tercile was ranked over each pass's stamp universe — recomputing
        historical flags over a different universe is a re-adjudication, not a backfill.

    PIT: values derive only from frozen chains/{date}.parquet snapshots with filename
    date ≤ as_of (and the file-D-carries-session-D−1 vintage makes that strictly
    conservative).  The pass prints the max(chain_date − as_of) it used, which must be
    ≤ 0 by construction.  Never overwrites a non-null.  Idempotent.
