"""Cron-liveness dead-man switch for the authoritative US nightly (daily.yml).

WHY THIS EXISTS — the 2026-08-11/08-12 outage.  The US nightly went dark for two
consecutive sessions and NOTHING reported it; the operator found it by looking at
the site.  Every instrument we already had was blind to this failure, each for its
own structural reason:

  * ``heartbeat.yml`` -> ``scripts.healthcheck`` measures ``run_status.json``'s
    ``last_run`` against ``max_age_hours=96``.  96h is sized so a Friday bake still
    looks alive at the Monday 14:30Z check (Fri 22:40Z -> Mon 14:30Z is 63.8h), so
    it CANNOT trip on one — or two — missed nightlies.  It is a four-day instrument.
  * ``scripts/freshness_sentinel.py`` (VPS, every 30 min) budgets Prophet at
    ``PROPHET_MAX_SESSIONS_BEHIND=1``.  That budget is correct and cannot be
    tightened: between the 20:00Z close and the 22:30Z bake, "1 session behind" IS
    the healthy state.  So a missed bake for session D cannot honestly breach until
    after session D+1's close — ~24h of designed blindness.
  * ``heartbeat.yml`` also runs ``runs-on: [self-hosted, macstudio]`` — the same
    pool as the lane it watches.  A watchdog that shares fate with its subject
    reports nothing exactly when it matters.

None of those is wrong; they measure DATA staleness with weekend-safe budgets.  The
failure mode they all miss is the one that actually happened: **the scheduled run
was never created at all.**  #5362 pushed daily.yml past GitHub's silent ~512,000
byte processing cap, and the cron simply stopped firing — workflow state read
``active``, githubstatus was all-operational, and the stranded dispatches sat queued
with zero jobs (see ``tests/test_workflow_file_size.py`` for that postmortem).  A
data-staleness instrument can only infer that hours-to-days later, through its
weekend padding.  Asking GitHub "did a run get created?" sees it immediately.

WHAT THIS CHECKS.  Four questions, in the order a human would ask them:

  A. RUN CREATED   — did daily.yml produce a run at all since the last completed
                     NYSE session's fire window?  Catches: the workflow-file strand,
                     a disabled workflow, a deleted/renamed cron, GitHub dropping
                     the schedule.  This is the check that would have fired on
                     2026-08-12 at 08:00Z, ~9.5h into the outage.
  B. RUN CONCLUDED — did one of those runs actually finish ``success``?  Catches
                     the 2026-08-12 signature: six dispatches force-cancelled by a
                     live fleet session, one stuck queued.  A FRESH in-flight run is
                     INDETERMINATE, never a breach — the nightly legitimately runs
                     for hours.  But an in-flight run older than IN_FLIGHT_MAX_AGE
                     is a POSITIVE observation of a wedge, not a long bake: on
                     2026-08-16/17 a job queued on a runner label with no live
                     runner held run 31977372592 open ~24h while every check read
                     the eternal in-flight as "still baking" and the boards froze.
                     Age turns "still baking" into "hung or hostage" — breach.
  C. DATA ADVANCED — did ``site/prophet/index.json``'s ``source_asof`` actually move?
                     Catches the case A and B cannot see: a run that concludes green
                     while the ledger silently fails to advance (the #4779 law — an
                     absence of red is not a pass).  This is also the backstop for a
                     run that hangs forever and so never leaves INDETERMINATE in B.
                     Weekend hole (closed 2026-08-17): with a flat budget of 1, a
                     missed FRIDAY bake reads "1 behind" all weekend and could not
                     alarm before Tuesday.  Once the fire window is STALE_GRACE
                     behind us and no fresh run is alive, even 1-behind is a breach
                     — a healthy Friday bake lands hours before the grace expires.
  D. EVERY BOARD   — did each of the FIVE market boards (US, China, Hong Kong,
                     Canada, International) advance, each measured on its OWN
                     exchange calendar?  Catches the 2026-08-14 Canada freeze: the
                     Canadian board sat at ``as_of=2026-08-13`` for five days while
                     daily.yml ran green, the render lane re-committed the file
                     nightly, and its four siblings advanced.  C could not see it —
                     C grades one artifact, and it belongs to a different market.

WHY D IS A SEPARATE CHECK RATHER THAN A WIDER C.  A re-render is not an advance and
a green lane is not a green board, but the deeper reason is the calendar: HK and the
mainland close hours BEFORE the ET nightly fires, so their boards routinely carry a
session the US board has not reached yet (measured 2026-08-04: hk/cn read 08-04 while
us read 07-31).  One shared NYSE anchor would call that healthy state stale and, in
the other direction, paper over a real freeze.  See MARKET_BOARDS for the per-market
budgets, the mainland's table-independent holiday floor, and the one market
(International) that no single exchange calendar can govern.

VERDICT DISCIPLINE (borrowed verbatim from freshness_sentinel).  Blindness is never
a breach.  An unreadable API response, an empty run list, a missing index file, an
unparseable timestamp -> INDETERMINATE: reported as a ``::warning``, exit stays 0.
A false alarm every night trains the operator to ignore the channel, which is how a
dead-man switch dies.  Only a POSITIVE observation of absence fails.

FRESHNESS IS MEASURED AGAINST THE EXCHANGE CALENDAR, never the wall clock — the
cross-cutting lesson of every stale-store incident here.  When the pipeline dies,
every store freezes together and agrees with itself; only the calendar knows a
completed session is missing.  A calendar anchor also means a weekend or a market
holiday can never manufacture a breach, which is what lets this budget be tight
where the 96h heartbeat has to be loose.

WHERE IT RUNS.  ``.github/workflows/nightly-liveness.yml``, on GitHub-hosted
``ubuntu-latest`` — deliberately NOT the macstudio pool, so the watchdog cannot be
taken out by whatever took out the nightly.  The repo is public, so that runner is
free (CI self-hosted migration Wave 1, #5465).

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check_nightly_liveness.py                 # live: fetch + evaluate
    python3 scripts/check_nightly_liveness.py --selftest      # synthetic assertions
    python3 scripts/check_nightly_liveness.py --runs-json F --index-json G   # offline
    python3 scripts/check_nightly_liveness.py --site-root DIR # offline check D

Exit codes:
    0  healthy, or INDETERMINATE (blind — see above)
    1  a positive observation of absence: no run, no success, stale data, or a market
       board that did not advance

# check D — per-market board freshness
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# WHY D EXISTS.  Checks A/B/C above watch the LANE (daily.yml) and ONE artifact
# (site/prophet/index.json, the US Prophet board).  All five market boards are baked
# by that same lane, so A and B already cover "did the nightly run" for every market
# — but C's dual-read covers only US.  On 2026-08-14 that gap opened for real:
# site/factordata/canada_standouts.json froze at ``as_of=2026-08-13`` and was still
# frozen five days later, while daily.yml ran green, the render lane re-committed the
# file every day, and its US/HK/mainland siblings all advanced to 2026-08-14.  Every
# instrument we owned was satisfied: the lane was green, the file's git mtime was
# minutes old, and the ONE stamp anyone graded belonged to a different market.  A
# re-render is not an advance, and a green lane is not a green board.
#
# EACH MARKET IS GRADED ON ITS OWN EXCHANGE CALENDAR, never on NYSE and never on the
# wall clock.  This is not pedantry: HK and the mainland close hours BEFORE the ET
# nightly fires, so their boards routinely carry a session date the US board has not
# reached yet (measured 2026-08-04: hk/cn read 2026-08-04 while us read 2026-07-31).
# Grading those against expected_last_session(NYSE) would read the healthy state as
# stale in one direction and paper over a real freeze in the other.
#
# THE COARSE FORM ONLY.  Check C has two branches: a SHARP one ("a run concluded
# success for session D and the store is still on D-1") and a COARSE one ("the store
# is more than N sessions behind").  D uses only the coarse one, on purpose.  The
# sharp branch compares the store against the session THE BAKE WAS FOR, and that
# session is a NYSE date; at the 14:00Z slot the HK and mainland calendars have
# already rolled forward to a session whose bake has not fired yet, so a sharp
# comparison would page every weekday afternoon on a healthy estate.  The per-market
# budgets below absorb exactly that one session, which is what makes the coarse form
# safe across five different session clocks.

#: How the guard reaches each market's session calendar.  ``"weekday"`` is the
#: documented degradation for a market no single exchange calendar can govern.

#: The five Prophet market boards, each with the artifact that carries its own
#: "as of what session are these picks" stamp and the calendar that stamp lives on.
#:
#: ``max_sessions_behind`` is 1 for every calendar-backed market, for the reason
#: PROPHET_MAX_SESSIONS_BEHIND is 1: the guard's own slots (08:00Z / 14:00Z) straddle
#: the bake, so exactly one session of lag is the healthy state at some hour of the
#: day and the SECOND missed session is the breach.  Measured, not assumed — at
#: 14:00Z the HK calendar has rolled to today while today's bake fires at 22:30Z, so
#: a healthy HK board reads 1 behind every weekday afternoon.
#:
#: ``min_calendar_days`` is a table-INDEPENDENT floor that must ALSO be exceeded
#: before a breach is declared, and it is set for the mainland alone.  lib/cn_calendar
#: is deliberately minimal (its own docstring: a missing holiday reads as a false
#: "stale", never a silently-wrong "fresh"), and the State Council routinely extends
#: Spring Festival and Golden Week past the statutory core the table encodes — 2026
#: encodes Feb 16-20, the real closure runs longer.  Those un-encoded days are phantom
#: sessions, so a bare 1-session budget would page every February and every October on
#: a board behaving exactly as it should.  MAX_LEGIT_CLOSURE_DAYS (11) is the constant
#: lib/cn_calendar publishes for precisely this pairing, and it is what
#: build_china_library.compute_board_staleness already pairs with.
#:
#: The floor is NOT always on.  Phantom sessions can only accrue while the exchange is
#: shut, so it applies only when the calendar places a scheduled weekday closure between
#: the board's stamp and the session we expect (``_holiday_in_gap``).  Outside a holiday
#: window the mainland pages at 2 sessions like every other market.  Measured against the
#: 2026-08-14 freeze shape, that narrowing moves the mainland's first page from
#: 2026-08-26 to 2026-08-19 while leaving Spring Festival and Golden Week silent.
#: COST, NAMED, AND IT IS BIGGER THAN IT LOOKS: a mainland board that dies ON THE EVE of
#: a long closure is caught at 11+ calendar days rather than 2 sessions, and — unlike
#: every other market — NOTHING ELSE IS WATCHING IT IN THE MEANTIME.  Checks A and B
#: watch WORKFLOW_FILE (daily.yml), and daily.yml does NOT bake the mainland or HK
#: boards: it iterates build_canada_library + build_intl_library (daily.yml:4365), while
#: build_china_library + build_hk_library are baked by asia-close.yml:696.  So for cn and
#: hk, check D is the ONLY instrument in this guard, and inside a closure window the
#: floor is a real uncovered gap rather than a delay behind a faster check.  Accepted
#: here because the alternative is a false page every Spring Festival and every Golden
#: Week, which mutes the channel; the durable fix is to teach checks A and B about
#: asia-close.yml, which is a wider change than this one.
#:
#: MEASURED, not assumed.  Sweeping a healthy board (stamped by the most recent 22:30 ET
#: fire) across every 08:00Z and 14:00Z slot of 2026, 2027 and 2028 produces ZERO breaches
#: on all five markets.  On a board frozen after the Fri 2026-08-14 bake, the first page
#: lands: hk/cn 08-18 14:00Z, us/ca 08-19 08:00Z, intl 08-21 08:00Z.  Re-run that sweep

    # A SEPARATE risk plane from the five boards above: the CN/HK risk-radar forward
    # ledgers (data/risk_radar_intl/{cn,hk}_forward_log.jsonl) that the settled
    # asia-close lane advances once per session, independent of daily.yml (which does
    # not bake asia-close at all — see the MARKET_BOARDS module comment on checks A/B).
    # A run concluding SUCCESS every night proved nothing about these ledgers: a
    # gate-classifier bug held both stalled for hours on 2026-08-20 with every asia-close
    # run still green, and the July-August outage ran a MONTH with no independent
    # instrument watching either file. ``kind: "ledger"`` routes these through
    # ``_ledger_expected_session`` / ``sessions_between`` instead of the board path's
    # ``expected_last_session`` / ``sessions_behind`` — the exchange's own settle time
    # (09:00Z cn / ~09:30Z hk) is HOURS before the asia-close lane's own ~15:17-15:20Z
    # write, so grading a ledger on the exchange's settle time would call a healthy,
    # still-in-progress afternoon "behind".
    #
    # DETECTION CONTRACT (Sol adjudication, 2026-08-20 review of PR #6140): "detect a
    # silent ledger stall within the NEXT expected market session" — NOT the same
    # session's own 20:00Z look. ``max_sessions_behind: 1`` is what encodes that: a
    # SUSTAINED stall (session D's row never lands, AND D+1's does not either) first
    # exceeds budget at D+1's 20:00Z check (behind=2), which is still "within the next
    # expected session" of the miss. A single-session hiccup that self-heals — D's write
    # fails once but D+1's lands normally — never exceeds budget 1 at any look and stays
    # quiet BY DESIGN, mirroring the boards' own phantom-session budgets. Budget 0 was
    # rejected: it deterministically false-pages on any weekend-anchored State-Council
    # closure lib/cn_calendar does not encode (the table is deliberately minimal — see
    # its module docstring; the review traced five dated false pages through 2029,
    # e.g. Qingming Mon 2026-04-06), on the asia-close lane's own measured late-fire tail
    # (runs concluding as late as ~19:11Z, cutting into the 20:00Z floor's margin), and on
    # the ledger's own measured healthy-era misses (advanced only 9 of 12 CN sessions
    # 2026-06-26→07-16 even while the lane ran green). Budget 1 absorbs all three classes
    # while still catching a genuine sustained stall within one extra session.
