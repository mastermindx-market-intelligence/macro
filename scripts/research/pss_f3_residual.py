"""PSS-F3 — Idiosyncratic residual reset (beta-stripped own-flush exhaustion).

PRE-REGISTRATION — this header is the pinned ruler AND the pinned construction,
committed BEFORE any timing outcome (MAE/W5/proximity) was computed. The prereg
commit ("prereg: PSS-F3 …") precedes the results commit in git history (audited).
Charters: research/PSS_WSIG_SHORTLIST_BY_FABLE.md §F3 + §"Execution rails";
research/PERSONALITY_SIGNAL_SUITE_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md §W-SIG / §0 / §2.
Trial-ledger family: pss_f3_residual (registered in data/trial_ledger.jsonl in
the same pre-run commit as this file). Siblings F1 (pss_f1_downvol, KILLED) + F2
(pss_f2_overnight, KILLED) — this study REUSES their corrected machinery
(metric_arrays / null_stats / bars_for / tool_dates / _name_uplift per-name-first
collapse / c32_gate) and MUST NOT repeat F1's two shipped bugs (E1 median-of-
binary sign-flip on any binary-rate metric; E2 contaminated placebo pool).

Copy law R-W1T-3 governs all text here: this is a reset-CONFIRMER / exhaustion /
terminality / capitulation construction — it never "calls bottoms" (the words
"bottom caller" / "calls bottoms" are BANNED; use exhaustion/reset/terminality/
capitulation). "validated" is CI-banned.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
THE ONE MECHANISM HYPOTHESIS (pre-registered).
At a durable IDIOSYNCRATIC bottom, a name's sellers exhaust while the market /
sector tide is still going out, so the beta-stripped RESIDUAL (name return minus
its rolling beta × sector-benchmark return) prints its capitulation and turns UP
BEFORE the RAW price low — because the price is still being dragged down by a
falling benchmark the name no longer leads down. Fire ONLY when the residual and
systemic components DISAGREE (residual recovering while the raw price is still
falling / flat). This is the "different stocks bottom differently" family:
SILENT by construction in systemic flushes (high name–sector R², residual not
leading — see the 2022 containment test).

WRONG-RULER CHECK (§W-SIG execution rail, performed BEFORE statistics were
chosen). The object under test is an ENTRY-TIMING claim: "does a residual-turn-up-
while-price-still-falling bar sit shallower-to-the-trough / closer-to-the-low /
EARLIER than the raw-price analog and the incumbent cross?". It is NOT a hold-
return claim. Grading it on fwd63 hold returns would be the DNR §3 wrong-ruler law
(#1458, Oracle reversion reframe — the same error PTT-W1-T corrected; F1 and F2
carried the identical paragraph). Therefore the metrics below are entry-quality
metrics (MAE-to-trough, proximity-to-low, td-to-trough), never drift metrics.
fwd-return is not read.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
FINAL PINNED CONSTRUCTION (closes only; PIT throughout; level-invariant log rets).

0. SECTOR-ETF MAPPING (per name → GICS sector → SPDR sector ETF).
   PINNED SOURCE = data/breadth/ticker_sectors.parquet (ticker → GICS sector, the
   canonical 11 GICS labels), mapped to the SPDR sector ETF by the fixed dict
   GICS_ETF below (Information Technology→XLK, Financials→XLF, Energy→XLE,
   Materials→XLB, Industrials→XLI, Health Care→XLV, Consumer Staples→XLP,
   Utilities→XLU, Consumer Discretionary→XLY, Real Estate→XLRE, Communication
   Services→XLC). ETF PRICE series = data/yahoo/{ETF}.parquet 'close' (yahoo total-
   return adjusted, deep history: XLB/XLE/XLF/XLI/XLK/XLP/XLU/XLV/XLY from 1998,
   XLRE from 2015-10, XLC from 2018-06). NAME PRICE = data/baskets/ohlcv/{sym}.parquet
   'close' (also total-return adjusted — SAME convention, so the beta regression is
   consistent; both legs are ratios/log-returns and the TR adjustment nets out).

   CONSTRUCTION RE-PIN (PRE-OUTCOME, disclosed — mirrors F1 M1/M2 amendment
   pattern; NO IS/OOS uplift computed or read before this pin). The charter §F3
   sketch says "data/sector_holdings membership". Inspected: data/sector_holdings/
   history.parquet is a TOP-20-holdings-per-ETF snapshot (220 tickers = 11×20) —
   it resolves only 164/1300 W1 names, biased to the largest holdings, too thin
   for a panel study. data/breadth/ticker_sectors.parquet is a purpose-built
   ticker→GICS map covering 799/1300 W1 names with the exact 11 GICS labels that
   map 1:1 to the SPDR sector ETFs — the SAME mechanism (idiosyncratic-vs-SECTOR),
   richer coverage. Re-pinned to ticker_sectors as the membership source; the
   top-20 history.parquet agrees on shared names (both are current GICS). A name
   with no resolvable sector mapping is EXCLUDED (printed reason) — NEVER defaulted
   to SPY: that would change the mechanism from idiosyncratic-vs-sector to
   idiosyncratic-vs-market (a market-residual SECONDARY column is added, clearly
   labeled, NOT the primary — see §SECONDARY).

1. THE LEGS (daily, level-invariant log returns; PIT).
     r_name[d] = ln(close_name[d] / close_name[d-1])
     r_sec[d]  = ln(close_sec[d]  / close_sec[d-1])   (on the name↔ETF inner-join calendar)
   Name and ETF are inner-joined on common trading dates before differencing.

2. ROLLING OLS BETA (vectorized cov/var — NOT a python np.polyfit-per-bar loop;
   the charter's heaviest-step requirement). Over a trailing window of `betawin`
   return days:
     beta[d]  = Cov(r_name, r_sec)[trailing betawin] / Var(r_sec)[trailing betawin]
     alpha[d] = mean(r_name)[betawin] − beta[d]·mean(r_sec)[betawin]
   PIT — the residual on day d uses the beta/alpha estimated THROUGH d−1
   (beta_pit = beta.shift(1), alpha_pit = alpha.shift(1); no lookahead):
     r_res[d] = r_name[d] − alpha_pit[d] − beta_pit[d]·r_sec[d]
   Trailing name–sector R² (for the mechanism test, §FALSIFIER prong 4):
     r2[d] = Corr(r_name, r_sec)[trailing betawin]²   (also shifted PIT for the fire).

3. RESIDUAL DRAWDOWN + TURN (the capitulation object).
     R_cum[d]  = cumsum(r_res)                          (cumulative residual path)
     R_max[d]  = cummax(R_cum)                          (trailing residual high, PIT)
     rdd[d]    = R_cum[d] − R_max[d]   (≤0)              (residual drawdown from its high)
     z_rdd[d]  = rdd[d] / (rolling_std(r_res, betawin)[d] · sqrt(betawin))
                 (residual drawdown in residual-vol units — the per-name z-extreme;
                  scaled by sqrt(betawin) so it is a cumulative-path z, comparable
                  across windows).
   RESIDUAL TURN-UP (higher-low / momentum sign-flip UP over RMOM bars):
     resid_up[d] = (R_cum[d] > R_cum[d-1])                       (residual advancing today)
                   AND (R_cum[d] − min(R_cum[d-RMOM .. d]) > 0)   (off a local residual low)
   RMOM pinned = 5 trading days (a short residual-momentum window; NOT grid-varied —
   the grid varies z and betawin only, per charter).

4. THE DISAGREEMENT GATE (residual and systemic DISAGREE — F3's distinctive fire
   condition). The raw price must still be falling or flat while the residual turns:
     raw_falling[d] = (r_name[d] ≤ 0)                            (name not up on the day)
                      AND (close_name[d] < max(close_name[d-RMOM .. d]))
                                                                  (raw price not recovered —
                                                                   still below its recent high)
   FIRE[d]  iff
     z_rdd[d] ≤ zthr           (residual drawdown at a per-name z-extreme)
     AND resid_up[d]           (residual makes a higher-low / turns UP)
     AND raw_falling[d]        (RAW price still deepening/flat — DISAGREEMENT)
   The fire is emitted at the name's structure-derived RUNG: a raw-daily fire is
   RETAINED only if it lands on/at a rung-bar close (rung from the codex), matching
   the "emit at the structure-derived rung" charter instruction — see rung_gate().

5. SMALL PINNED GRID (multiplicity budget = 4 cells, disclosed; NO per-name best-
   of-grid selection — the standing DNR §2 two-ruler kill, PTT-W1a).
     zthr ∈ {−1.5, −2.0}  ×  betawin ∈ {60, 120} trading days  = 4 cells.
   ALL FOUR graded and reported side by side. PRIMARY pre-registered cell =
   (zthr=−2.0, betawin=120). The other three are robustness. zthr and betawin are
   FIXED (not derived, not outcome-selected). The rung is DERIVED per name from the
   codex (never outcome-selected).

PER-NAME MEASUREMENT AXIS (report it; bars-derivable, no event fitting):
  (a) residual-return autocorrelation HALF-LIFE at the bar-size ladder — the same
      rho-ladder machinery as W1b structure-measurement but computed on the RESIDUAL
      series (r_res) not raw: rho at 3D / 1W / 2W bar sizes and an ACF-decay half-
      life of the residual series (how fast a name's idiosyncratic shock mean-
      reverts). (b) beta-estimation-window stationarity: the split-era beta drift
      = |beta_FIT_median − beta_TEST_median| (does the name's sector beta drift
      across eras — a residual-fit stationarity read). Both PRINTED, display-tier
      context — NOT gated on.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
RULER (§7 house standard; machinery COPIED from ptt_w1_timing_regrade.py —
metric_arrays / null_stats — and ptt_w1_persistence_of_fit.py — bars_for /
tool_dates — NOT reinvented). Closes-only, house shadow-book form.
  Per signal at daily index i:
    mae63 = min(close[i+1..i+63]) / close[i] − 1        (%; ≤0; PRIMARY-lens raw)
    prox  = close[i] / min(close[i−31..i+31]) − 1        (%; ≥0; §7 ±31td window)
    w5    = prox ≤ 5%                                    (entered within 5% of the low)
    tdt   = argmin offset of close in [i−31,i+31] (td; negative = trough BEFORE fire)
    mfe21 = max(close[i+1..i+21]) / close[i] − 1  ·  rc21 = close[i+21]/close[i] − 1
  Valid-day universe per half: i ≥ 31 AND i + 63 < len (both windows resolvable).
  RANDOM-DAY NULLS: per-name, per-half, per-metric all-days medians/rates over the
  half's valid days (the base-rate trap guard).
  THE TWO INFERENTIAL METRICS (exactly two; everything else is descriptive):
    U_MAE = median signal mae63 − all-days median mae63   (pp; +=shallower=better; PRIMARY)
    U_W5  = signal within-5%-of-low rate − all-days rate    (pp; CO-PRIMARY)
  tdt / prox / mfe21 / rc21 are DESCRIPTIVE.

  ⚠️ HARD AGGREGATION REQUIREMENT (F1 shipped a median-of-binary SIGN-FLIP bug
  here — NOT repeated). For ANY binary rate metric (U_W5, prox rates), aggregate
  PER-NAME FIRST: per name compute the RATE = mean(hit indicator), subtract the
  name's baseline rate, THEN take the cross-name MEDIAN of those per-name uplifts.
  NEVER take np.median over pooled per-fire binary-minus-constant rows (for a hit
  rate < 50% that mechanically collapses to −base, flipping the sign). The
  `_name_uplift` helper and the bootstrap are COPIED from the corrected
  pss_f1_downvol.py / pss_f2_overnight.py (groupby("sym").agg(w5=("w5_x","mean"))
  then cross-name median, mirroring ptt_w1_timing_regrade.bootstrap). A self-check
  asserts the F3-vs-all-days U_W5 bootstrap point matches a direct per-name-median
  computation within bootstrap noise (printed — the F1 E1 guard).

  INFERENCE: month-cluster bootstrap (cluster = signal calendar month; DT-R14 —
  ticker-only clustering is FORBIDDEN), NB = 1000, RNG seed 20260730 (pinned).
  ERA SPLIT (DT-R16): FIT ≤ 2020-06-30 / TEST ≥ 2020-07-01, plus the 2021+ sub-
  window (≥ 2021-01-01). A full-sample-only effect is DISQUALIFIED. All grading is
  on TEST; FIT is used ONLY to measure the per-name axis (beta drift, residual rho).

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
FALSIFIER — FIVE prongs, ALL pre-stated (this is F3's kill; the placebo mirrors
the precondition — the F1 lesson; F2's net-return-analog is the template). ALL
nulls printed regardless of outcome (nulls printed, never hidden).

  1. F3 vs ALL-DAYS per-name random-day null (basic near-low check, like F1/F2's).

  2. RESIDUALIZATION-ADDS-NOTHING null (the MIRROR placebo — F3's analog of F2's
     net-return-analog). Build a RAW-RETURN ANALOG = the IDENTICAL construction
     (same zthr, same betawin-length windows, same RMOM turn logic, same rung gate)
     but on RAW returns / RAW drawdown instead of the residual: r_raw = r_name,
     RAWcum = cumsum(r_name), raw drawdown z, raw turn-up, and the SAME "still-
     falling" gate is vacuous on raw (drop it — the raw analog fires on a raw-price
     z-drawdown that turns up). Grade F3 − raw-return-analog on U_MAE and U_W5
     (month-cluster bootstrap PAIRED on the same resampled month-clusters, per-
     name-first). If beta-stripping does NOT beat the raw analog, the
     residualization carries NO information and F3 dies. F3 fires are NOT a subset
     of raw-turn days (F3 requires the residual to lead WHILE raw is still down) —
     so the placebo is a matched-construction counterfactual, NOT a disjoint
     complement; an overlap census (both / F3-only / analog-only) is reported.

  3. F3 vs the INCUMBENT Stoch-RSI<20 cross at the derived rung (tool_dates(bars_for
     (px, rung), "S")): F3's MAE-to-trough must be SHALLOWER (charter prong 2), on
     the SAME names.

  4. MECHANISM test (charter prong 3 — F3's distinctive falsifier). F3 fires must
     CONCENTRATE in LOW-R² (idiosyncratic) windows. Compute the trailing name–sector
     R² (PIT) at each fire; report the distribution of fires across the NAME'S OWN
     R² TERCILES (terciles cut per name on that name's valid-day R² distribution).
     PRE-STATED: residual-lead should concentrate in the LOWER R² tercile. If fires
     cluster in the HIGH-R² (systemic) tercile instead, the mechanism is dead —
     reported regardless of outcome.

  5. EARLINESS. F3 median td_to_trough must be STRICTLY earlier (more positive /
     more pre-trough) than BOTH (a) the incumbent Stoch-RSI cross AND (b) the raw-
     return analog, on the SAME names. If not strictly earlier, the "pre-trough"
     claim is RETRACTED to at/post — stated plainly (F2's earliness claim failed
     this exact test; grade it honestly).

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
C32 TERMINALITY GATE (pre-registered CONDITIONER — a pre-stated column pair, NOT
post-hoc; graded WITH and WITHOUT on the primary cell). COPIED verbatim from
pss_f1_downvol.c32_gate (M = 20 td): decline decelerating INTO a fresh 60d low
(roc20 stopped making new lows + rolling-low slope flattening). The gate only
narrows.

2022-CLASS CONTAINMENT DIAGNOSTIC (pre-stated — F3's STRUCTURAL strength).
The charter claims F3 CANNOT fire the 2022 pattern BY CONSTRUCTION (2022 mega-cap
troughs were SYSTEMIC — high R², residual not leading — so the disagreement gate
stays shut). Fire counts in H1-2022 (2022-01-01..2022-06-30) vs a ±21td window
around the 2022-10-13 low, on the high-idiosyncratic-variance focus names
(TSLA NVDA META JNJ UNH PG) AND on expected-SILENT high-R²/index-like names
(KO, PG-in-broad-selloffs, MSFT during macro flushes). PREDICTION: H1-2022 fires
≈ 0 on the systemic names. If F3 fires heavily into H1-2022, the by-construction
containment claim is FALSE — reported regardless. META/NVDA/PG are OFF the W1
panel (fell to W1 eligibility) — run from raw OHLCV as named exhibits, flagged.

SECONDARY (clearly-labeled, NOT primary): a MARKET-residual variant — the same
construction with the sector ETF replaced by SPY (data/yahoo/_GSPC.parquet). This
is reported as a SECONDARY column ONLY (idiosyncratic-vs-market, a different
mechanism than the primary idiosyncratic-vs-sector) so the sector-vs-market
distinction is auditable; it NEVER substitutes for the sector residual on an
unmapped name.

UNIVERSE / ELIGIBILITY. Universe = W1 panel names (data/research/ptt_w1_panel.parquet)
that (a) resolve to a sector ETF (ticker_sectors) AND (b) have the ETF series in
data/yahoo AND (c) have baskets/ohlcv price. A name is F3-ELIGIBLE iff its codex
rung is measurable AND it has ≥3 FIT and ≥3 TEST primary-cell fires with resolvable
mae63/prox. Coverage census (eligible / excluded + reasons: no sector map / no ETF
series / no rung / too few fires) is PRINTED — never a bare count (vacuous-green
law). High-R² / index-like names that stay STRUCTURALLY SILENT are the FEATURE,
not a miss — reported as correctly-silent (zero-fire on the systemic class), not
as excluded.

REGISTRY COMPLIANCE. DT-R14 month-cluster · DT-R16 era split · DNR §2 two-ruler
kill respected (zero per-name best-of-grid; rung derived, not selected; zthr/betawin
fixed) · DNR §3 wrong-ruler law is the MOTIVE for the entry ruler · R-W1T-3 copy
law (exhaustion/reset/terminality/capitulation language; no "bottom caller"/"calls
bottoms" verb; "validated" avoided) · display-tier only — NOTHING here promotes to
authority (the gauntlet is a PROMOTION gate, not this build gate; a null never
blocks accrual; LLMs originate nothing — deterministic arithmetic). The
commissioning session rules the verdict; this report states what was found, no
verdict language.
