"""Consecutive-failure escalation for resilient brun() builders — daily.yml ENGINE job + asia-close.yml CN/HK bands.

Reads the band scratch dir ($RUNNER_TEMP/band/<slug>.rc + <slug>.log) written by
the parallelised regional + desk builders step.  Maintains a per-builder streak
ledger (data/ci/builder_failstreaks.json) and escalates loudly when any builder
has failed for N consecutive nightlies — making a sustained page freeze visible
even while the nightly stays green.

Background: brun() BY DESIGN never aborts on a non-zero exit (::error:: +
step summary only, site still deploys).  This is correct — one broken builder
must not 404 the whole dashboard.  The visibility gap is that a builder failing
MANY CONSECUTIVE nights (e.g. build_cycle 2026-07-16/17) looks identical to a
one-off at a glance.  cycle.html silently froze while the run stayed green.
This script fixes that gap.

Design principles (house laws):
 - Lane-gated writes: each write lane advances exactly ONE ledger (nightly ->
   data/ci/builder_failstreaks.json; asia -> data/ci/builder_failstreaks_asia.json
   — asia-close.yml is the sole nightly for the CN/HK pages so it owns a
   separate forward ledger).  A write lane pointing at another lane's ledger
   degrades to report-only (loud warning) — this stops a misconfigured port
   or a copy-paste into closing-bell.yml from advancing another lane's ledger.
   Unmapped lanes (closing-bell) never write, exactly as in #2738.
 - Fail-open: any read/parse failure degrades gracefully; exit 0 always.
 - Idempotent same-day reruns: same UTC date re-run does NOT increment the
   streak (last_rc / label updated only).
 - Gap tolerance: a streak is preserved across runs whose last_run_utc is within
   max-gap-days calendar days (runner starvation sometimes kills the nightly
   before the band step; a builder broken across such a gap is still one
   continuous freeze).
 - Stale-escalation decay (write lane, non-empty rc set): if a ledger entry's
   slug is absent from this run's rc-file set, the builder was renamed or
   retired; the entry is dropped immediately so it does not re-enter the
   breached list for up to prune-days days.  Trade-off: a mid-band cancellation
   that wrote only SOME rc files can drop a real streak (it restarts at 1 the
   next night) — accepted; the alternative (keeping absent slugs) produces
   30-day zombie alerts on renames, which is worse.  In the multi-dir case:
   if ONE band died but the other wrote rc files, the union is non-empty and
   the dead band's slugs decay (restarting their streaks at 1 next run) —
   same accepted trade-off.  Guard: if the rc set is EMPTY (all art dirs
   missing or crashed before writing any .rc files), the ledger is NOT mutated
   and escalation from ledger-only state is suppressed — real streaks must not
   be wiped by a run where the band itself died.
 - Prune: entries older than prune-days are dropped so removed builders leave
   no zombie rows (belt-and-braces; mostly superseded by the decay rule above
   on write lanes).
 - Escalation fires every night while breached (pressure intentional; dedup is
   the W6b spine's job).
 - Dispatch-always invariant: push_ops_alert is dispatch-always for ops lanes.
 - Maintenance vocabulary only: no trading verbs in composed messages.
 - Atomic-ish write: tmp file then os.replace so the commit step never reads a
   partial write.
 - Article 2: ops-tier alerting via ratified W6b spine only.

Run IMMEDIATELY AFTER the builder band step(s) in daily.yml ENGINE job and
asia-close.yml CN/HK nightly.
