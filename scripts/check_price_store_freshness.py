"""Price-store freshness gate — assert the committed US price store holds the latest
completed NYSE session before the regime engine runs.

WHY (2026-07-07 stale-regime incident, nightly run 28845154707): the collect job fetched
Monday 07-06 bars, but its non-fatal commit step died 5x on the pre-#1823 "cannot pull
with rebase: You have unstaged changes" bug and went GREEN with only a ::warning::. The
engine job (needs: collect, fresh checkout) then read a store frozen at 07-02, computed a
faithful-but-stale RISK_OFF/40 and persisted it as the canonical
data/market_state/latest.json; the live feed carried that backbone (nightly_asof
2026-07-02) while a recompute on real 07-06 data said MIXED/56. The intraday self-heal's
store-behind-market check (scripts/refresh_regime_if_stale.py mode 3) was blind: its
market reference (the massive manifest) froze in the SAME dead push, so every committed
store agreed on the stale date. Only the exchange calendar knows a session is missing —
this gate is that calendar assertion, at the top of the engine lane.

WHAT: compare the store's last SPY daily close (data/yahoo/SPY.parquet) with
lib.nyse_calendar.expected_last_session(). Behind + --heal => re-pull the yahoo price
group (keyless, ~16s; lib.store.upsert folds the bars into the store, and the engine
job's "commit engine outputs" `git add data/` carries them to main — self-healing the
dead-push case without waiting for a human re-dispatch). Behind and unhealed => exit 3
with a ::error:: annotation. The workflow step wraps this in continue-on-error, so the
dashboard still builds from cached data (the engine job's if:always() philosophy) — but
the step shows RED, and engine.market_state.persist() independently stamps the canonical
snapshot `freshness.stale` so the staleness is self-declaring downstream.

A marker JSON (data/quality/price_store_freshness.json) records every evaluation.

Exit codes: 0 fresh/healed, 3 stale (annotated), 2 unexpected error.
`--selftest` runs synthetic assertions (calendar pins + decision logic) and exits 0/1.
