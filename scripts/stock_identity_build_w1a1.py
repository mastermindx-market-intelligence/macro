"""Build the registered W1-A1 B-only Stock Identity amendment.

This is intentionally not a stage of ``stock_identity_build_atlas.py``.  The W1
universe, pilot, partitions, constants, combined artifacts, census, and GOLD chart
are sealed.  A1 reads those objects, computes one design-touched Barrick row against
the frozen W1 context, and writes only its registered append-only paths plus one
reversible disclosure block in the existing GOLD markdown dossier.

The command has no collection fallback, parameter sweep, repartition, recalibration,
or universe rebuild.  ``--validate-only`` performs every available preflight without
writing.  The normal run computes into an OS temporary directory, validates the full
staged result, publishes the governing receipt last, and refuses any overwrite.

# Live-plane revision tripwire bands.
#
# The band is on the UNIFORMITY of the vendor's rescale, not on its level, and that is
# load-bearing rather than cosmetic.  A level band cannot survive an ordinary dividend:
# auto_adjust re-scales the whole ELAPSED history on every FUTURE ex-date, so a routine
# ~$0.10 Barrick quarterly on a ~$41 tape moves every historical row by ~2.4e-03.  A 1e-5
# level band fires on that, and on far less -- a $0.02 dividend lands at 4.90e-04 and even
# a $0.005 one at 1.22e-04 -- so it re-reds the fleet on the next ex-date, which is the
# very failure the snapshot above exists to end.  It also measures the wrong quantity: a
# uniform rescale leaves every return, drawdown and percentage gap identical, so it cannot
# move an A1 conclusion.  Only a change in RELATIVE prices can, which is what the residual
# against the window's median factor sees.  Corporate actions are not thereby ignored:
# split adjustment rescales share counts too, so settled volume must match EXACTLY.
#
# Measured 2026-08-18 over the 3,172-row prefix: O/H/L/C move by one per-row float64
# factor coherent across the four columns to 4.4e-16; the residual against the window
# median stays within 8.63e-07; volume is byte-identical on all 3,171 settled rows across
# three collections spanning four days, with only the ASOF bar moving (10,621,100 ->
# 10,625,700, 4.33e-04) as its consolidated tape settled after the cut.
#
# The coherence band is deliberately NOT the observed 4.4e-16.  Coherence holds that
# tightly only because the vendor derives O/H/L from one float64 ratio and sets
# close=adjclose, so the common factor cancels; the underlying raw prints are
# float32-quantized (they arrive as 40.79999923706055), a grid of ~6e-8.  A
# machine-epsilon band would sit BELOW the noise floor of the quantity it guards, so one
# raw print re-quantizing by a single ULP would report vendor noise as a print revision.
# 1e-6 sits ~16x above that grid and still catches any single-column restatement worth
# naming: 1e-6 of a $41 tape is $0.00004.  Coherence cannot be dropped -- it is the ONLY
# detector of a one-column move, because a lone outlier among four leaves the median, and
# therefore the residual, untouched.
