"""Repair the dated GEX snapshots that carry the 2026-08-01 defects.

Why this exists
---------------
Two defects shipped in `compute_gex` and were repaired on 2026-08-01:

  1. `gamma_flip` was the zero-crossing of a running sum across the STRIKE LADDER, not
     the zero-gamma SPOT (macro #4189). SPY published 275.00 against a spot of 741.69.
  2. A degenerate quote (`iv` at the solver floor, where Black-Scholes gamma diverges)
     could dominate `net_gex_bn` (macro #4194). SPY published -$1,129bn on 2026-06-26.

Re-running the nightly repaired the LIVE artifacts, but `gex_history/{ROOT}/{DATE}.json`
is keyed by the payload's own `asof`, so only the current session's snapshot was rewritten.
Every earlier snapshot still carries both defects, and the Exposure desk's dated replay
reads them as fact.

Neither defect is repairable from the stored rows. The flip needs the chain re-priced on
a spot grid — reconstructing it from `by_strike` is exactly the unsound method that was
retired — so this re-runs `compute_gex` per (root, date) against the ThetaData store.

Measured before running (2026-08-01): 450 snapshots across 47 roots, of which 102 carry
a flip more than 25% from spot. That is *structurally impossible* for the repaired
estimator, which searches a ±25% grid — so those 102 are definitively contaminated, and
the true count is higher (a wrong flip inside the band looks perfectly ordinary).

What it preserves
-----------------
`history` is attached by a separate step in the nightly and is NOT recomputed here, so
it is carried over from the existing snapshot. Only the fields `compute_gex` owns are
replaced. A snapshot that cannot be recomputed (chain missing for that session) is left
exactly as it was and counted — never half-written, never deleted.

Usage
-----
    # dry run: report what WOULD change, touch nothing
    python -m scripts.repair_gex_history

    # rewrite locally, then upload the repaired snapshots to R2
    python -m scripts.repair_gex_history --apply --publish
