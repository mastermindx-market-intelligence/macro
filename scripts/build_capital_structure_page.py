"""Render the Capital Structure observed-filing-state desk.

The browser receives its issuer rows and filing evidence only through the
authenticated Capital Structure API. This builder deliberately writes no data
projection: it emits the premium desk shell and its paired assets so an
ordinary full-site render cannot leave the page stale. The one exception is a
read-only Policy watch chip (B-F09-6, MO-PAID-067), which cites a single
dated policy_calendar step — display-only, no score/rank/direction.

Usage:
    python -m scripts.build_capital_structure_page
    python -m scripts.build_capital_structure_page --root /path/to/repo

# Round-2 review BLOCKER 1/2: the prior constant named two basket ids
# ("capital_markets", "capital_formation") that DO NOT EXIST anywhere in this
# pipeline's basket taxonomy — engine/federal_register* ingests documents into
# a frozen set of 17 industry-sector baskets (ai_semiconductors, solar, ...),
# none of them a capital-markets/financial-regulation theme, so the chip could
# never reach `present` and its `empty` copy asserted active watching that was
# never happening (an UNKNOWN shaped as an EMPTY).
#
# Measured against the live artifact this build reads
# (data/federal_register/documents.parquet, 2026-09-06, 33,696 rows / 17
# baskets / 74 agency_slug values): the one real basket that actually carries
# SEC / Treasury / FinCEN / OCC / FDIC filings is `fintech_payments` (349 rows;
# 246 treasury-department, 83 consumer-financial-protection-bureau, 3
# securities-and-exchange-commission, 2 financial-crimes-enforcement-network,
# 2 comptroller-of-the-currency, 1 federal-deposit-insurance-corporation).
# `federal-reserve-system` and any `commodity-futures-trading-commission`-like
# agency are NOT present under this basket (Fed appears once, under an
# unrelated basket; CFTC does not appear anywhere in the 74-agency taxonomy at
# all) — so "Fed" and "CFTC" were dropped from the chip's own copy below
# rather than left as an unbacked claim.
