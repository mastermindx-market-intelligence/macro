"""Emit the copy-paste BRAINSTORM PACK for cheap-LLM compound generation.

The operator pastes the output of this script into ChatGPT (or any model)
to solicit NEW compound specs for the Oracle research factory. The pack is
self-contained: rule grammar, available columns/events, mechanism families,
output format — and, critically, the ALREADY-EXPLORED section is read LIVE
from the committed registry + trial ledger + the adjudicated nulls, so the
external model cannot waste tokens re-proposing tested ground and the
dedup context can never go stale (it is generated, not maintained).

Nothing the external model returns is executed: it returns compound-spec
JSON only; the grammar firewall (engine/oracle/compounds.py) is the sole
evaluator. Paste returned specs into data/oracle/compounds/registry.jsonl
(or hand them to any Claude session) and run:

    python -m scripts.oracle_screen --all-pending --data-dir <MAIN>/data

Usage:  python -m scripts.oracle_brainstorm_pack [--n 10] > /tmp/pack.txt
        python -m scripts.oracle_brainstorm_pack --reversion [--n 10] > /tmp/rev.txt

  dead unconditioned-momentum null wearing conditioners. Do not re-propose.
- A high hit-rate at tiny n is NOISE, not edge (round-1 A4: +5.5% / 86% hit at
  n=21; round-2 F2: +3.3% / 71% at n=50, era 2/4; E2: +2.8% but 43% hit at

- Participation-STATE gating (breadth_50>=~0.5 / rs>=0 / cohesion>=x as the
  PRIMARY entry condition, no flow-event or washout trigger): flat-to-negative
  across EVERY family on tier-s (round-2 B3 -1.2%, A6 -1.3%, C3 -1.3%, C5 -1.7%,

  all-history — negative on available data, but that is NOT cross-era death;

- cohesion_rebuild as the PRIMARY trigger: weak/dead on tier-s (round-3 A10
  n=80 & A11 n=77 both era 1; F3 +0.29% era 1; F4 -0.17%). The rebuild flag
  fires too sparsely and doesn't hold across eras — do NOT use it as the

_REVERSION_OBJECTIVE = """\
OBJECTIVE (REVERSION-CAPTURE — NOT the 63-day factor metric):

We are hunting BUY-IN signals that catch a SAFE, HIGH-WIN-RATE reversion off
a basing low. The entry captures the washed-out / basing low; the ride is the
bounce; the EXIT is near the momentum top (2D StochRSI roll-over), average
hold ~20-30 sessions.

Scoring harness: `oracle_reversion_screen.py`, window W=25, exit E=21.
Per entry — ABSOLUTE (no SPY benchmark):
  - MFE  : 25-session max up-excursion (gain potential)
  - MAE  : 25-session max drawdown (safety floor — CRITICAL)
  - ret_exit: 21-session time-exit return (proxy for StochRSI-top exit)
  - asym : mean_MFE / |mean_MAE|  (MFE/MAE ratio — the safety criterion)

Regime at entry: risk_off if spy_above_200d==0 OR vix_pctile>=0.70.

PASS gates (ALL must hold):
  1. n >= 100
  2. WR >= 0.62 (win-rate primary; 63d WR numbers do NOT transfer)
  3. asym >= 1.5 (upside excursion at least 1.5x the max drawdown sat through)
  4. ret_exit >= +1.0% absolute AND > 0 in BOTH risk_on AND risk_off regimes
  5. OOS holdout WR >= 0.58 AND same sign AND holdout n >= 100
  6. Timing placebo: real mean ret_exit > 95th pctile of 500 random-timing draws

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES IN ORDER: win-rate first, drawdown-avoidance (asym) second,
absolute exit-return third, regime-robustness fourth. Drawdown AVOIDANCE matters
more than gain size. A signal that bounces +7% in 3 weeks then mean-reverts
is EXACTLY what we want — it scores near-zero at 63d but is a perfect reversion
entry (demonstrated: A15 = +1.30%/63d endpoint, +7.2% MFE, +3.0% at 21d, 73% WR).

Do NOT benchmark vs SPY. SPY is ~50% mega-cap tech; excess-vs-SPY hides the
defensive-rotation win. Use absolute return + regime split.

This is the same shape as the operator's proven MACD+StochRSI 2D/3D confluence
entry engine."""

_REVERSION_PRIORS = """\
=== REVERSION PRIORS — what is KNOWN on THIS metric ===

IMPORTANT: The 63-day adjudicated nulls and screen priors were measured on the
WRONG ruler (63d point-to-point excess). They do NOT transfer to the reversion
metric. This is a FRESH START on the reversion objective. Treat shapes tested
only on 63d as "reversion score unknown."

WHAT IS KNOWN (reversion metric):

SAFETY: Episode-qualified washout in RISK-OFF + DEFENSIVE sectors:
  ~2:1 MFE/MAE, ~77% WR, beats a stalled tape (A15 pattern).
  Bare/cyclical washout without episode conditioning: ~1.2:1 MFE/MAE — a coin
  flip on safety. The episode qualifier BUYS SAFETY, not more mean return.

PRIORITISE these entry shapes:
1. OSCILLATOR-TURN entries:
   - stochrsi_w_k crossing stochrsi_w_d from below (K/D bullish cross)
   - stochrsi_w_k or stochrsi_w_d rising up through oversold (e.g. <=20 ->
     crossed_above 20 or 30) — the turn OUT of oversold is the signal
   - MACD-analog: velocity/acceleration turning from negative to positive
     (vel_1w crossed_above 0, or accel crossed_above 0 after sustained negative)
   - accel_z turning (crossed_above -1.0 or 0.0 after being deeply negative)

2. VOLATILITY-COMPRESSION / COILED setups:
   - After a washout, volatility falls and price bases; coiled entry captures
     the eventual release
   - Breadth or oscillator flattening while vel/accel is low-but-turning

3. BASING AFTER WASHOUT:
   - washout_w>0 (confirmed capitulation) + subsequent oscillator stabilisation
   - Velocity/accel recovering from a trough while still muted

4. WASHOUT/FLOW CONDITIONED ON REGIME AND SECTOR CHARACTER:
   - Regime conditioning (spy_above_200d==0 OR vix_pctile>=0.70) is the single
     biggest safety multiplier — risk-off washouts are structurally safer
   - Defensive vs cyclical character matters: defensive sectors (utilities,
     healthcare, staples) hold better downside; cyclical washouts are riskier
   - Episode-event triggers (out/onset x same-complex or any x within_sessions)
     are the clearest "something broke and forced sellers" signal

5. MOMENTUM IGNITION OFF THE LOW:
   - The first upward velocity tick after a base: vel_1w crossed_above 0 while
     washout_w>0 or stochrsi was oversold
   - First positive accel after sustained negative accel

SAFETY FIRST — prefer entries whose downside is STRUCTURALLY LIMITED:
  - Already washed out (washout_w=1) means sellers have been exhausted
  - At oscillator extremes (stochrsi_w_k <=20) means the tape has priced in
    the bad news
  - Combined: washed-out AND oscillator at floor = maximum structural safety
  Goal: HIGH WR + SHALLOW MAE, not a large mean return.

NOTE ON 63d-SCREENED SHAPES: these were measured on the WRONG ruler. Shapes
like participation-state gating, plain leadership continuation, cohesion_rebuild
as primary trigger — these had near-zero or negative 63d scores. Their reversion
scores are UNKNOWN. They may or may not work here. Do not avoid them because of
63d scores; but also do not re-propose them just because they are no longer
"blocked" — propose them only if you have a genuine reversion-mechanism thesis."""

MISSION: cast a WIDE net. Across several runs of this prompt the operator wants
200-500 DIVERSE specs; the mechanical screen then sorts them. Your job this run

(already mapped) — spend <=10% of proposals there.

MECHANISM COVERAGE GRID — sample widely across all of it:
- TRIGGER (the event that fires the entry): use MANY different primitives —
  every panel column should appear as a trigger somewhere in the batch, via
  crossings (crossed_above/below a level OR another column) or regime turns;
  AND episode_event triggers (in/out x tiers x scopes x min_count).
- CONDITIONER (0-2 secondary filters): macro regime (vix/tlt/spy), microstructure
  (turnover_z/persistence/accel_z), or a cross-column comparison.
- Use ALL SIX ops. Use BOTH episode-event and panel-condition triggers. Use BOTH
  in and out episode directions. Propose genuinely NEW families (NEW:<name>).

DIVERSITY RULES (enforced by review — near-duplicates are wasted volume):
- <=3 specs may share the same TRIGGER primitive; vary the conditioner/threshold.
- Each spec must tell a DISTINCT money-flow story (mechanism_en must differ).
- Mix leg-counts: some 1-leg triggers, many 2-3 leg conditioned rules.

=== ORACLE COMPOUND BRAINSTORM PACK (grammar v{GRAMMAR_VERSION}; mode={mode_tag}; generated live) ===

ROLE: You are a quantitative idea generator for a sector-rotation research
factory. You produce COMPOUND SPECS (JSON) — declarative entry rules over a
daily panel of US sector/subsector rotation features. You NEVER write code,
never claim validation, and never re-propose tested ground (listed below).
Your specs are screened mechanically by a causality-safe evaluator; effects
are measured, counted, and only survivors are promoted. {role_ask}

THE GRAMMAR (your entire vocabulary — specs outside it are rejected):
- Conditions: {{"col": <column>, "op": <one of {sorted(VALID_OPS)}>, "value": <number>}}
  or {{"col": a, "op": ..., "value_col": b}} (column-vs-column).
- Episode events: {{"episode_event": {{{episode_fields}}}}}.
- Combine with {{"all": [...]}} / {{"any": [...]}}. Entry = rule true as-of day t,
  executed next daily close. Everything is joined strictly as-of t (no lookahead
  is possible — the evaluator guarantees it).
- Sequence (v1.2.0+): {{"sequence": {{"first": <rule>, "then": <rule>,
  "within_sessions": N}}}} — fires at t iff `then` is true at t AND `first`
  was true on ≥1 day in [t-N, t-1] (strictly before t; both legs causal).
  `first` may be any v1 rule incl. episode_event/all/any; sequence-inside-
  sequence is REJECTED. Adds top-level "cooldown_sessions": <int> to suppress
  re-fires on a node for N sessions after each kept fire.
- Universe: {{"tier": "s"}} (11 sector ETFs, 1998->, survivorship-clean — claims
  live here) or {{"tier": "m"}} (354 subsectors/themes/baskets, 2021->, watermarked).
{horizons_note}

AVAILABLE PANEL COLUMNS (per node per day, all causal):
{", ".join(COLUMN_SCHEMA)}

COLUMN SCALES (wrong scale = a rule that never fires — respect these):
- 0-100: stochrsi_w_k, stochrsi_w_d (median ~56; use 20/50/80, NOT 0.2/0.8).
- 0-1: vix_pctile, breadth_50, persistence (~0.23-0.75), cohesion (~0.09-0.78).
- 0/1 flags: washout_w, spy_above_200d, cohesion_rebuild (use ">value":0 or ge 1).
- small decimals (daily/rolling returns): ret, vel_1w, vel_1m, vel_3m, accel,
  tlt_ret_10d, oil_ret_10d, dollar_chg_10d.  z-scores (~ -3..+3, tails to +-8):
  accel_z, turnover_z.
- macro spreads/levels (%pts or index units, NOT 0-1): yc_slope (~-1..+3;
  <0 = curve inverted), hy_oas_chg_10d (~-4..+5, 10d change in HY credit
  spread; >0 = credit stress rising), fin_conditions (NFCI ~-1..+3; >0 = tight).
- Do NOT value_col-compare columns of DIFFERENT scales (e.g. stochrsi vs rs,
  vix_pctile vs turnover_z) — the comparison is degenerate/always-true.

NEW cross-asset regime columns (full-history, just added — the FRESHEST,
least-explored mechanism space): hy_oas_chg_10d (credit stress), yc_slope
(yield curve), oil_ret_10d (energy), dollar_chg_10d (USD), fin_conditions
(NFCI).  Sector rotation is DRIVEN by these — energy<->oil, financials<->curve,
tech/materials<->dollar+credit.  PRIORITISE this run: novel triggers on them
(e.g. hy_oas_chg_10d crossed_above 0 = credit stress onset; yc_slope
crossed_below 0 = inversion) and conditioning the washout/flow edge on these
regimes.  All clear the era gate.

HISTORY COVERAGE (HARD promotability constraint):
- FULL history 1998->: ret, rs, vel_*, accel, accel_z, persistence, vix_pctile,
  tlt_ret_10d, spy_above_200d, washout_w, stochrsi_w_k/d, hy_oas_chg_10d (1999+),
  yc_slope (1998+), oil_ret_10d (1999+), fin_conditions (1999+),
  dollar_chg_10d (2006+ — 20y, still clears the gate).
- 2021+ ONLY (~5yr, ~13.5k rows): breadth_50, cohesion, cohesion_chg,
  turnover_z, cohesion_rebuild.  A rule CONDITIONED on any of these fires only
  post-2021, so it CANNOT clear the era-consistency gate (3 of 4 eras) and is
  NOT promotable.  Use them at most as an optional probe leg, NEVER as the edge.
  Prefer full-history columns for anything you want promotable.

MECHANISM FAMILIES ALREADY MAPPED (extend them or propose NEW families —
say which): A conservation/routing (money must go somewhere), B sector
personality, C velocity-shift microstructure, D macro-regime conditioning,
E positioning (data still accruing), F information flow. Full prose:
research/ORACLE_COMPOUND_LIBRARY.md.

=== OUTPUT FORMAT (return ONLY a JSON list of specs) ===
[{{"id": "<SHORT_UNIQUE_ID>", "family": "<A-F or NEW:<name>>",
  "name": "<what the rule does — plain>",
  "mechanism_en": "<WHY money-flow mechanics make this footprint — must
    describe what the rule EXECUTES, no aspirational claims>",
  "entry_rule": {{...grammar...}}, "universe": {output_universe},
  "horizons": {output_horizons}, "status": "exploratory",
  "lineage": "external-brainstorm <model> <date>"}}]

RULES: mechanism_en must match the rule (truth-in-labeling is enforced by
review); prefer tier "s" for anything you'd want promotable; conditioning
compounds (X only-when Y) beat raw signals here — the measured nulls above
show unconditioned signals are dead; diversity across families beats ten
variants of one idea.{extra_rules}

COVERAGE FLOOR (hard): only propose rules you expect to TRIGGER >=100 times
across 11 ETFs over 1998-> (roughly 4+ entries/yr). Rules gated on rare
multi-node episode cascades, deep tier requirements, or narrow numeric bands
screen at n<30 and CANNOT be promoted — a strong hit-rate at n=20 is a
sampling mirage, not an edge (see screen priors). Favour conditioners that
fire often enough to measure: broad regime/flow states over rare coincidences.
