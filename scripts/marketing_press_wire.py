"""scripts/marketing_press_wire.py — the */5 Actions press wire (masterplan §10 E7).

WHAT THIS CLOSES. The press/Trump wire has never once reached X. The VPS daemon
(``scripts/marketing_fastlane_daemon.py``) emits press items with ``spool=True``,
which routes them to the GITIGNORED ``data/marketing/outbox/items-host.jsonl``;
the Actions publisher checks out main and folds the git-TRACKED ``items.jsonl``
and nothing else, so it has never seen a press emission. ``outbox._host_items_path``
says so in its own docstring ("The split-brain is unchanged"). On top of that the
daemon's systemd unit ships disabled and was never armed, so even the spool is
empty. Two independent reasons the lane is dark.

THE FIX IS THE HOT-TAPE PATTERN (#3941, ``scripts/hot_tape_radar.py``): run the
tick in GitHub Actions, emit through the CANONICAL outbox path (``spool=False``
→ tracked ``items.jsonl``), commit the state back with ``merge=union``, push,
and only THEN dispatch ``marketing-publish.yml -f post_now_item=<ids>``.

    python -m scripts.marketing_press_wire [--dry-run]

WHAT THIS LANE MAY WRITE (ledger law). Only ``data/marketing/outbox/*`` (through
``press_lane`` → ``outbox.enqueue``, plus the card SVG) and its own three state
files under ``data/marketing/press_wire/``. NEVER a forward ledger, never
anything the nightly owns. This loop runs 288 times a day.

STATE IS THE WHOLE DESIGN PROBLEM. On the VPS the press lane persists cursors,
conditional-GET ETags, the twitterapi.io spend counter, the flagship top-K
counter and the seen-ledger under the gitignored ``data/marketing/press/``. In
Actions every run is a FRESH CHECKOUT, so any state left there evaporates — and
an evaporating spend counter means the $75/mo twitterapi.io cap is not enforced
at all, because every run starts the month at $0.00. This lane therefore keeps
its state in COMMITTED files:

  data/marketing/press_wire/cursors.json    single-writer, last-wins whole-file
  data/marketing/press_wire/spend.jsonl     append-only DELTAS, merge=union
  data/marketing/press_wire/seen_ring.jsonl append-only keys,   merge=union

The split is deliberate. A push race that loses the cursors write costs one
re-poll (the seen ring still dedupes the result). A push race that lost a SPEND
row would under-count money and a lost SEEN row would re-post a story that
already went out — so those two are append-only with union merge, where the
merge driver cannot drop a side.

ONE LANE AT A TIME. The VPS daemon may still be armed some day (it reaches ≤90s
latency, which Actions' 5-minute cron floor cannot). The two must never poll the
same handles against the same cap from two different state stores, so this lane
stands down entirely when the repo variable ``PRESS_WIRE_DAEMON_ACTIVE`` is
true. The daemon's own paths and behaviour are untouched by this file — every
Actions adaptation below is a CONFIG TRANSFORM handed to the existing engine
functions, not an edit to them.

FAIL TOWARD "NO POST". Every step is never-raise and degrades to booking
nothing; the process exits 0 unless an invariant is genuinely broken.

Import discipline: pandas is NEVER imported on this path. ``breaking_relevance``
widens its ticker universe from ``data/earnings/earnings.parquet`` when pandas
AND that file are present and falls back to its static universe otherwise — the
workflow's sparse cone deliberately omits the parquet, so the fallback is the
only path here.

    guard's seed. A run whose push never lands loses BOTH at once — so the next
    */5 tick re-polls all 18 handles (no ``last_poll``) AND reads $0.00 spent (no
    deltas), and the cap can never fire. A persistent push failure therefore does
    not cost "one re-poll": it converts the $46.6/mo plan into ~$466/mo of real

    ``MARKETING_PUBLISH_ENABLED`` off — which is where the switch sits today —
    the publish sweep does not run, so nothing expires and nothing is COMMITTED:
    the operator opens the admin queue and reads 36 items, most of them about a
    tape that closed days ago, each one offering an Approve button. "i don't
    want to review so many posts per day."

    This lane ticks every ~5 minutes, is independent of the send switch (it
    reads ``MARKETING_OUTBOX_ENABLED``, the QUEUE switch), and already stages
    and commits ``data/marketing/outbox`` — see the workflow's `git add` step
    and `tests/test_marketing_press_wire.py`. Hanging the reap here is what makes
    an expiry PERSIST without an armed publisher.

    Three reapers, each already the canonical writer for its own class:

      * ``outbox.expire_stale_planned``     planned items past their 36h slot
      * ``outbox.expire_stale_wire``        fast-lane items past their idle TTL

        kind on a non-trading day, and any due item whose day words the clock
        says are now false

    NEVER POSTS, NEVER CALLS THE NETWORK. Three ledger folds and some
    `transition` writes, nothing else. Idempotent by construction: everything it
