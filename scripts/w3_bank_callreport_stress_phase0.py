"""W3 bank call-report stress — Phase-0 validation harness.

Family: w3_bank_callreport_stress
Primary source: FDIC BankFind API (bank-level call report data aggregated to BHC)
Tradable surface: KRE (SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF), beta-residualized

Variants (per frozen SIGNAL_LAB_FRONTIER_WAVE3_FABLE_ADJUDICATION_2026-07-06.md §1):
  V1  CRE-maturity-roll primary (GATED, primary)
      Proxy: nonfarm nonresidential CRE noncurrent rate delta (NCRENRER_delta)
             + CRE concentration trend (CRE/equity change)
      Note: Exact maturity-bucket schedule not available from FDIC call reports
            (it lives in FR Y-9C RC-C Part II). GAP-2 pre-registered above.
  V2  Deposit-mix deterioration streak (GATED, secondary)
      Signal: uninsured deposit share rising streak (n consecutive quarters above trend)
      + brokered deposit share acceleration
  V3  Canonical-ratio level composite — SPANNED-NESS CONTROL (GATED)
      Composite of: uninsured-deposit share level, CRE-to-equity level,
      nonfarm-nres-CRE noncurrent rate level
      Gate: V1 must beat V3 OUTSIDE Mar-2023 window (§1 spannedness gate)
  V4  21-day ruler robustness (NON-GATED) — same signal as V1/V2 on 21d vs 63d horizon
  V5  AVOID-side drawdown lens (NON-GATED) — does high-stress predict max drawdown
      in the next 63d (rather than signed returns)?

Forward return: KRE-beta-residualized individual ticker returns
  - For each basket member, compute beta vs KRE (rolling 252-day)
  - Residual = member return - beta × KRE return (market-neutral P&L)
  - Signal date: report_date + 60d (PIT enforcement — see PIT assumptions below)
  - Horizons: 21d and 63d

Statistical methodology:
  - Rank information coefficient (Spearman IC) over cross-sectional dates
  - Block-bootstrap CI (block=5 quarters for quarterly data)
  - Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction within family (3 gated trials)
  - Deflated Sharpe (DSR) from TrialLedger for the gated variants
  - Overlap correction: quarterly signal → IC measured at non-overlapping dates

Crisis-concentration gate (mandatory, pre-registered):
  - Full sample: 2018-Q1 to 2026-Q1 (33 quarters)
  - Mar-2023 episode: signals dated 2022-Q3 to 2023-Q3 (inclusive, PIT-shifted)
  - In-sample: all 33 quarters
  - Ex-2023: drop 2022-Q3 to 2023-Q3 inclusive
  - Pre-registered expectation: ACCRUE (n=1 crisis in sample — not enough for GO)

Spannedness gate (mandatory, pre-registered):
  - V1 median(|IC|) ex-2023 must exceed V3 median(|IC|) ex-2023 by > 0
  - If V1 beats V3 only inside 2023, the family adds no increment over canonical ratios

PIT assumptions (verified):
  signal_date = report_date + PIT_LAG_DAYS = 60 calendar days.

  FDIC bulk-data availability:
    - Call report filing deadline: 30 calendar days after quarter-end for banks
      with <$5B assets; 45 calendar days for larger banks (per FFIEC/FDIC rules).
    - FDIC BankFind financials bulk endpoint publication lag: typically 5-8 weeks
      after quarter-end for the aggregated financials endpoint; confirmed by comparing
      FDIC API 'Latest Available Data' metadata against known quarter-end dates.
      Example: Q1 2023 (2023-03-31) data appeared in FDIC bulk API on 2023-05-30
      (60 days), confirmed via the FDIC 'Statistics on Depository Institutions'
      release calendar (https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/sdi/index.html).
    - Late filers can delay the fully complete dataset by up to 10 additional days.
    - We enforce PIT_LAG_DAYS = 60 (worst-case lag) to avoid any look-ahead.
      The prior value of 45 days was insufficiently conservative for large-bank
      late filers; changed here to match the enforced worst case.

  AMENDMENT (2026-07-08, PIT-lag uniformity): the merged ACCRUE run
  (#1856/#1860) enforced the 60d lag only on failed-bank rows at panel load;
  surviving banks' signal_date flowed unchanged from the store panel, which
  scripts/collect_ffiec_y9c.py wrote at report_date + 45d. Survivor signals
  could therefore pre-date FDIC bulk availability by up to 15 days (mild
  look-ahead, contradicting the 'no look-ahead' claim above). Fixed:
  _load_panel() now recomputes signal_date = report_date + 60d for ALL rows,
  and the collector's PIT_LAG_DAYS was raised to 60. All IC tables were
  regenerated under the uniform lag; the amendment is disclosed in report §1
  and noted in the trial ledger (kind=amendment row — no new config, the
  correction applies uniformly to all variants, so effective_n is unchanged).

Survivorship-bias correction (FRC/SIVB-era rule):
  The point-in-time filer panel includes ALL BHCs that were in-universe
  (>=$2B assets, regional banking sector) at the signal date — including
  three banks that subsequently failed in 2023:
    - SIVB (SVB Financial Group / Silicon Valley Bank) — failed 2023-03-10
    - SBNY (Signature Bank, NY) — failed 2023-03-12
    - FRC (First Republic Bank) — failed 2023-05-01
  These banks are included in the panel for all quarters where FDIC financial
  data is available (2018-Q1 to 2022-Q4 for SIVB/SBNY, 2018-Q1 to 2023-Q1 for FRC).
  For forward returns: prices are sourced from the massive_stock_day store
  (coverage 2021-07-06 onward) with a terminal -100% return settlement applied
  at the delisting date. For signal dates before 2021-07-06, these tickers are
  absent from the price store and drop from the cross-section IC calculation
  for those dates (correct PIT behavior — no data, no contribution).
  The delisting return is applied as: a synthetic 'final_day' price entry of
  $0.01 (effectively -100%) appended immediately after the last observed price.

Design-substitution disclosure (FR Y-9C vs FDIC call reports):
  The frozen adjudication doc (§1) specifies FR Y-9C holding-company filings
  via the NY Fed PERMCO-RSSD crosswalk as the PRIMARY data source, with FDIC
  as an authorized fallback 'if the Y-9C bulk acquisition proves too heavy.'
  Assessment of Y-9C bulk acquisition (performed prior to this study):
    - FR Y-9C bulk: available via Chicago Fed / NY Fed FRED RSSD linkage
    - The Chicago Fed Y-9C bulk download requires a multi-GB file acquisition
      from the Chicago Fed public FTP (ftp.chicagofed.org/public/bhc/). The
      full 2018-2026 extract is approximately 8 GB compressed.
    - Schedule HC-C Part II (CRE maturity buckets) requires parsing a separate
      supplementary schedule that is not available in the FRED/RSSD bulk exports;
      the Chicago Fed bulk file contains the summary HC-C table only.
    - CONCLUSION: Y-9C bulk was assessed and falls back to FDIC per the authorized
      fallback condition. SPECIFICALLY: the maturity-bucket data (GAP-2) is NOT
      recoverable from the Chicago Fed bulk download either — it requires the full
      NIC/RSSD historical file and RC-C Part II schedule which is not in public bulk.
    - CONSEQUENCE: V1 remains a PROXY (delinquency delta + concentration trend),
      NOT the exact maturity-roll signal. This is pre-registered as GAP-2. The
      spannedness gate failure (V3 > V1 ex-2023) may partly reflect this missing
      maturity data. The study is disclosed as a proxy-only partial study.

Deseasonalization (amended from original build):
  Original: ncrenrer_delta = diff(1), cre_loan_delta1 = diff(1) [quarter-on-quarter]
  Amended:  ncrenrer_delta = diff(4), cre_loan_delta1 = diff(4) [year-on-year]
  Rationale: CRE noncurrent rates and CRE loan growth carry quarter-of-year
  seasonality (regulatory cycle, tax effects, construction starts). Raw 1-quarter
  diff conflates seasonal with fundamental trend. YoY (diff(4)) removes the
  additive seasonal component and isolates the true credit deterioration signal.
  Similarly, V2's deposit-mix changes (unins_q_chg, brkd_q_chg) are changed from
  diff(1) to diff(4) for the same reason.
  NOTE: The cross-sectional Spearman IC uses full-sample z-score standardization
  which is rank-preserving (monotonic, within-date), so the IC itself is NOT
  contaminated by the deseasonalization choice — but the signal COMPOSITION
  (which banks rank high vs low) changes, particularly in Q1 quarters.

DEPUNINS/LNNDEPC definition-break caveat (pre-registered):
  FDIC DEPUNINS (estimated uninsured deposits) is an FDIC-estimated series, not
  a directly reported Call Report field. FDIC methodology:
    - Pre-2009: uninsured deposits estimated as deposits > $100K threshold
    - 2009-2011: transition to $250K threshold (FDIC standard insurance limit raised)
    - 2012+: FDIC switched to self-reporting for banks >= $1B total assets
  Our sample starts 2018-Q1 (well after the methodology stabilized at 2012+), so
  the threshold/methodology break does not affect our sample. However:
    - Banks below $1B are still estimated (not self-reported); all our BHCs
      are well above this threshold.
    - LNNDEPC (brokered deposits) also has a definition evolution: the brokered
      deposit definition was narrowed under the 2020 FDIC brokered deposit rule
      revision (effective April 2021). This creates a structural step-down in
      reported LNNDEPC for some banks starting 2021-Q2. Users of V2 and V3
      signals should note this definitional break when comparing 2018-2020 vs
      2021+ levels.
  PRE-REGISTERED: both the uninsured-deposit level composite (V3) and the
  brokered-deposit streak (V2) use data that is methodologically consistent
  within our 2018-2026 window, with the noted 2021 brokered-deposit caveat.
