"""Coverage-gap diagnostic over the theme graph — mechanical, LLM-free (W3A §4, §9.9).

THE QUESTION IT ASKS. Given a set of instruments somebody cares about, which of them does
the concept vocabulary fail to explain? The motivating exemplar is the lithium one: three
names move together, each of them HAS local-theme memberships, and yet no single concept
contains more than one of them — a coverage gap that a per-name "is it in any theme?"
check cannot see, because every name individually looks covered.

So case A is a CO-OCCURRENCE report, not a zero-membership report:

  * pairwise shared-concept counts across the supplied ids;
  * the ids that share NO concept with any other supplied id — the gap signal;
  * ids with zero live memberships at all, reported as a sub-case (they are a different
    failure: no vocabulary rather than no SHARED vocabulary).

Case D is a BREADTH signal: ids whose only memberships are concepts above a reporting
floor. A 200-member concept explains "this is a US equity" more than it explains why
these three names moved. The floor is a REPORT PARAMETER — printed with the breadth
distribution beside it, never a truth claim about where "too broad" begins.

Cases B and C (theme_discovery clusters, co-movement) are documented in the plan and
deferred to W3B, where those inputs have state.

READ-ONLY over the store. The optional ``--propose`` writes probation rows, which are
suggestions in a queue nothing reads without a curated ratification — never edges.
