"""Apply the FROZEN §16 outcome handling after the TR-1 run (results wave).

Everything this script writes was pre-committed in PREREGISTRATION.md §16 "Outcome handling
(frozen)" — it makes no judgments, it executes them. The run produced 4 PASS / 6 (the 0/6
null branch did NOT fire), so per the frozen handling:

  1. Factory: one candidate per PASSING cell appended to
     data/cycle_pattern/pattern_candidates.jsonl — status 'screened', trial_family 'tr_v0',
     authority display_only (the §15 candidate conventions). Truth-guard cross-check via
     engine.research_factory.adapter_cycle_pattern.truth_guard (flag-only; results printed
     and recorded in the verdict doc).
  2. Truths (engine.cycle_pattern.truths): ONE display-class truth
     `cycle_truth_tr1_next_phase_softmax_skill_v1` scoped to the passing cells, with the
     failing cells named inside the statement (honest scope).
  3. NO null truth (frozen: the single scoped null is registered only on 0/6).
  4. No page/UI change; shipped-surface adoption is a SEPARATE wave.

Idempotent: every write is guarded by an existence check, so re-runs are no-ops.
