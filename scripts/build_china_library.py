China parallel of scripts/build_stock_library.py. Runs the SAME cycle/ladder

# ── W0.7 DUAL-READ: is a thinner shelf a DATA gap, or just a RED TAPE? ────────
# A day-over-day count drop CANNOT tell those apart on its own. On 2026-08-19 the
# guard stamped "Probable data/collector coverage gap" while every health instrument
# was green (sessions_behind=0, universe 1641 vs 1635, micro/signal coverage 100%,
# reversal coverage 99.5%) — the real cause was a broad selloff: the CSI300 ETF closed
# -2.78% on 22 advancers against 60 decliners, and the eligible drop concentrated in
# late_or_unfillable (69→7), i.e. extended names losing buy-state on a pullback. That
# is exactly what a red tape does to an entry shelf.
#
# House law (CLAUDE.md § House laws): an INSTRUMENT verdict is not a MARKET verdict.
# So the guard now names a cause only when it can actually evidence one:
#   data_gap        — a health instrument is RED. Unchanged wording; this is the alarm.
#   tape            — health all green AND the tape is broadly red. The shelf really is
#                     thinner; say so honestly instead of accusing the collectors.
#   no_cause_found  — health all green, tape readable and NOT red. Fewer names cleared;
#                     we found no gap and no selloff. Claim neither.
#   unverified      — a health instrument is BLIND (unreadable). Assert nothing.
# Only `data_gap` may say "coverage gap"; only `tape` may blame the market. The banner
# still renders in every case — the shelf IS thinner — but it stops inventing a cause.

    ``sessions_behind`` is ``staleness["inputs"]["sessions_behind"]`` — ``None`` when
    ``compute_board_staleness`` returned its fail-soft sentinel, which is BLIND, not
    green, and therefore forces ``unverified`` rather than a tape acquittal.

    ``universe_prev`` is a SECONDARY check: it is often uncomparable (a previous
    outage shell writes ``universe: 0``, and older artifacts omit the key). Current
    prices plus full same-day coverage already establish that the data arrived, so an
    uncomparable universe is recorded as unchecked and does not block a tape read — a
    universe that IS comparable and has shrunk past the threshold still means data_gap.

    ``advancers``/``decliners`` are applied as a scale-free RATIO, so the caller may
    pass any consistent cross-section. Deciding whether the sample is big enough to be
    a market read is the CALLER's job — the builder only passes counts when at least

    pass None and get no latch writes; it may not get them by omission.

    W1.1 — THE SKIP COUNTER IS TWO DIFFERENT FACTS. One counter used to absorb both
    "this name has no price history at all" (a genuine survivorship hole: the graded
    win/loss mix is missing a delisted name and is therefore survivor-tilted) and
    "this episode's T+1 fill simply has not printed yet" (a name that surfaced on the
    newest board — nothing is missing, it is in flight). Publishing the sum under the
    name ``n_skipped_no_price`` made the survivorship alarm read high every single
    night for a reason that was not survivorship, which is the same conflation the US
    desk fixed when 22 liquid names including DE and F were reported as unpriceable.
    They are counted separately now and ``n_skipped_no_price`` means only the first.

    W1.2 — ADMISSION-ROW METADATA. ``rk``/``tr`` used to come from a ticker-keyed map
    built by iterating the whole frame, so a repeat ticker's LAST board row overwrote
    the earlier ones and every episode of that name was labelled with the rank/tier it
    carried on its most recent appearance — including episodes that closed weeks
    before. The lookup is keyed on the episode's own ``(entry_date, ticker)``
    admission now, keep-FIRST, mirroring the store's own (date, ticker, definition)
    rule.

    Rewritten 2026-07-26 onto engine.track_scoring. Three changes from the
    board_day × ticker version this replaces:

      * EPISODE GRAIN. A name on the board for ten sessions used to emit ten rows that
        all measured overlapping windows of the same move. The summary counted them as
        ten independent observations, so `n` read 840 when the desk had made roughly
        400 distinct calls across 15 nights — and the Wilson interval built on that n
        was several times too narrow to be honest.
      * FORCED VERDICT AT H=10 sessions, replacing "21d if matured, else mark to the
        latest close". Marking unmatured rows to today pooled holding periods of 1 and
        17 sessions into one hit rate.
      * DATE-BLOCKED CI (in the caller's summarize()), replacing Wilson-on-raw-n.

    A-share specifics that must NOT be shared with the US desk and are preserved here:
    the T+1 OPEN (or (H+L)/2 proxy) fill via china_standout_track, and the locked-limit
    exclusion — a bar that printed high==low==close is unfillable at any price, so those
    episodes are flagged and kept OUT of the summary. No oscillator target exit: the 3D
    StochRSI thresholds the US desk exits on were fit on US volatility and have not been
    refit for A-share limit-board dynamics, so CN runs fixed-horizon until they are.

    ENTRY-PRICE INTEGRITY (2026-08-08, 300363.SZ case study). The entry used to be
    re-derived from the price store on every nightly, which made a PUBLISHED number
    mutable: the 08-05 row shipped e=16.30 / p=+4.5% off an 08-06 bar that printed
    open 16.2999 against low 16.98 — an impossible bar nothing checked — and silently
    restated to e=17.52 / p=+16.7% once that bar healed. `_cst.resolve_entry` now sits
    on this path and enforces three rules: a corrupt T+1 bar never supplies an entry
    (fall back to the documented HL2 basis, else DEFER and retry next nightly); an
    entry already published is LATCHED point-in-time and a disagreeing re-derivation is
    disclosed in `er` / `erw` instead of overwriting `e`; and `eb` records the basis the

    Grain: EPISODE (contiguous board run) from data/china_standout_track/board.parquet,
    scored on CSI300-relative excess at a forced 10-session verdict via
    engine.track_scoring — the same core the US desk uses. See _cn_ledger_rows for what
    changed from the board_day × ticker version and why, and engine/track_scoring.py
    for the three rules that make the number honest.

    TWO ERAS, TWO RECORDS, NEVER ONE NUMBER
    ---------------------------------------
    The store spans a board-definition change (2026-07-30). This function grades it in
    two disjoint cohorts and emits them side by side:

      * the LIVE record — rows stamped with `board_definition` — stays exactly where
        every existing consumer expects it (`summary`, `rows`, `meta.board_definition`);
      * `prior_record` carries the pre-version rows (null / '' / 'legacy' stamps) with
        its own summary, its own rows, its own publish state and a bilingual era label.
      * `extra_records` catches any OTHER stamp in the store — one labelled block per
        stamp value. Those rows used to match neither mask and disappear from the
        artifact without a trace; they are now graded, published under their own name
        and announced with a ``::warning`` in the Actions log.

    All of them go through `_cn_grade_era`, so the scorer, horizon, fill, locked-limit
    rule and CI method are identical and a reader may legitimately compare them. They
    are never summed. Filtering to the live stamp alone is what erased the desk's
    history on 2026-07-30 (348 matured episodes at 66.7% became n=0 `accruing`
    overnight); pooling the eras would have been the opposite error, since the boards
    selected their names by different rules and their union measures neither.

    A-share specifics preserved (these are real market differences, not style):
      • T+1 OPEN (or (H+L)/2 proxy) fill via china_standout_track.resolve_entry — CN can
        trade the open; the US desk fills at the next close. The entry is PIT-LATCHED and
        the T+1 bar is sanity-checked (open ∈ [low, high]); see _cn_ledger_rows.
      • locked-limit T+1 rows: fl=['locked'], flagged in the table and EXCLUDED from
        the summary. A bar that printed high==low==close is unfillable at any price.
      • EXCESS vs CSI300 is the headline, not absolute P&L: in A-shares beta dominates,
        so an absolute win rate would mostly measure the index rather than the desk.
      • no oscillator target exit — the US desk's 3D StochRSI thresholds were fit on US
        volatility and have not been refit for A-share limit boards.

    `bt` is grade()'s output already in memory (kept for callers/back-compat; the
    publish state now derives from the sample itself via track_scoring.publish_state).
    `buy_rows` = today's ranked board (wide['buy']) used only as a name/sector display
    lookup. Render budget: lib.store reads are UNCACHED, so we install a per-ticker
    memo over _cst._price_frame for the duration of the loop (try/finally restored),
    collapsing O(rows) parquet reads to O(unique tickers).

    `lane` is the collection lane, and it gates ONE thing: whether this run may advance the
    keep-first PIT entry latch. Omitted, it resolves from `CN_LANE` via _collection_lane()
    — fail-closed, so an unset variable latches nothing. The emitted JSON is identical
    either way; only the data/ write differs, which is the house law (nightly is the sole
    advancer of forward ledgers) applied to the entry price.
    Returns True on a successful atomic write.
