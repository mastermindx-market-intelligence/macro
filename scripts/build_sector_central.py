The consolidation hub: engine.sector_central fuses the cycle map + the VALIDATED absolute-trend

(window.SECTOR_CENTRAL), the raw JSON, runs the self-grader (append today's calls + grade matured

# ── ACT-NOW BOARD TIER GATE (docs/TIER_PREVIEW_PATTERN.md) ───────────────────
# templates/_us_act_now_board.html.j2 is SHARED with us_stocks.html, where PR
# #5846 gave it the three-shape split (full / gated shell / rows-only). That gate
# is driven by build_site and reached only that page: this host passed no `pgate`,
# so sector_central.html kept server-rendering all five lanes in full to anonymous
# readers — 45 `.actitem` rows, measured live 2026-08-17 — and the us_stocks gate
# merely moved the same rows one click away. This page never loads
# tier_preview.js either, so there was no client-side overlay here to soften it.
#
# Same mechanism, its OWN payload. The board arrives here through the reader
# pattern (site/basketdata/action_board.json, written by an earlier build_site
# run), so this page is rendered by a different script at a different time from a
# possibly older generation of the artifact. Sharing site/premiumdata/us_stocks.json
# would make whichever builder ran last silently overwrite the other's rows, so
# the withheld remainder ships as site/premiumdata/sector_central.json. Both are
# under the /premiumdata/ prefix that config/site_access.yml already enforces at
# premium.enforced_early, so no policy change is needed for a NEW file there.

#: plotly at module scope, and importing it here would drag the whole page stack
#: into this fail-soft builder and out of the import-light CI lane. The two tables
#: and the template's own fold ids are pinned together by
#: tests/test_sector_central_gate.py::test_lane_table_matches_build_site (and
