"""Nightly basket-washout state + history -> site/factordata/basket_washout_{state,history}.json.

Display-tier support artifact for the RATIFIED blocked-entry override (construction A1b,
threshold 25%): `research/BLOCKED_ENTRY_CONDITIONAL_PREREG.md` §5 ratification log +
`research/BLOCKED_ENTRY_RATIFICATION_PACKET_2026-08-10.md` §4.

WHAT THIS IS: a nightly snapshot of how deep each US thematic basket's members sit below
their 252-session highs, plus the per-name lookup (which group a name reads through, and
whether that group clears each of the three published thresholds).  Nothing here scores,
ranks, or gates anything — the live `enter`-mask conditional stays behind its own two
standing gates (production-feed re-grade + signal-era fence).  This artifact only lets a
reader-facing surface show the same peer-washout number the study measured on.

CONSTRUCTION (mirrors `research/blocked_entry_study/r3_axes.py`, the graded instrument):
  * per-name drawdown  = close / close.rolling(252, min_periods=60).max() - 1
  * a basket's state   = the MEDIAN of that drawdown across its members that print on
                         `as_of`; a group needs >= 5 such members or it is omitted
  * a name's peer set  = its PRIMARY basket -- the smallest basket (>= 5 curated members)
                         the name belongs to, ties broken by id, i.e. the most
                         thematically specific one
  * fallback           = GICS sector peers (data/breadth/ticker_sectors.parquet) for names
                         no basket claims
  * names in NEITHER mapping are OMITTED -- never defaulted to a neutral value
  * `qualifies[t]` is recomputed from the PUBLISHED (rounded) number, so a consumer that
    re-derives the flag from `peer_median_dd_252` / `peer_dd` always agrees with us

THE TWO MAPS ANSWER DIFFERENT QUESTIONS -- read the field you actually mean:
  * `baskets[<id>].peer_median_dd_252` describes the GROUP: the plain median over every
    member that printed, no exclusions.  It is a basket-level state chip.
  * `names[<TICKER>].peer_dd` is the LEAVE-ONE-OUT median -- the name's peers with the
    name ITSELF removed.  This is the quantity r3_axes.py computed per event, so it is
    the one every published gate was measured on.  A name is usually among the deepest
    drawdowns in its own basket, so letting it vote in its own peer median would ship a
    systematically MORE PERMISSIVE rule than the one that passed the gauntlet.  The two
    numbers therefore differ, and names inside one basket differ from each other.
    The MIN_PEERS floor applies to the FULL group (as upstream), so a 5-member group
    leaves a 4-peer read.

Basket membership comes from the curated store `data/baskets/membership.json` (the same
source `scripts/build_baskets.py` and the prophet candidates' `theme_membership_ids`
descend from); members carrying a `removed` date are dropped.

SECOND ARTIFACT -- `basket_washout_history.v1` (operator directive 2026-08-10, "historical
fires must be re-markable under the as-shipped rule"): per name, the date-INTERVALS during
which it qualified, over its full available history, on the same leave-one-out read and the
same group the state artifact gives it.  `intervals` is keyed PER NOTCH ({"20": [...],
"25": [...], "30": [...]}), so moving the live dial -- 20 as of 2026-08-10 -- is a
consumer-side change that never needs this artifact rebuilt.  Interval ends are inclusive;
a null end means the run reaches `as_of`.  Crossings are printed RAW -- no smoothing, no
minimum length -- because the shipped rule is evaluated per fire date, so a one-session
qualifying window really does admit a fire that lands in it.
IT IS A RETRO-APPLIED LENS, NOT A RECORD OF CALLS MADE: today's rosters are applied to the
whole past (see HISTORY_NOTES, which ships inside the artifact).

COST: reads only the names it needs (basket members + GICS-mapped names), one close column
each, ~2-5s wall on the full US panel; the history pass adds ~4s (one argsort per group
rather than a per-date median sweep -- see loo_median_matrix).  Measured end-to-end at ~9s,
so it is a full recompute every night: no incremental store, nothing to go stale, and still
an order of magnitude inside the budget.  It is a nightly display artifact and must stay off
the render-critical path.
