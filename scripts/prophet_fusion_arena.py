"""Arena harness SKELETON for the Prophet US conditional-fusion program (PR-1a).

Binding spec: ``research/PROPHET_CONDITIONAL_FUSION_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md`` §5.1
(evidence-family registry), §8.3 (metric surface), §8.5 (frames), §9 (validation
protocol).  ``research/prophet_fusion/ARENA_HARNESS_NOTES.md`` is the usage doc.

WHAT THIS IS.  The machinery §9 describes, with a NO-OP challenger in the slot a real
model will later occupy — folds, the PIT gate, fold-scoped normalization, coverage
accounting, date-grouped scoring, and the §8.3 metric scaffold, proven end to end.

WHAT THIS IS NOT.  There is no model here, and no result from it may be quoted.
RESEARCH TIER, ZERO AUTHORITY: read-only over committed stores, no ``data/`` writes
(every artifact goes to a caller-supplied ``--out``), no import of any ranker.  The
challenger is stamped ``dummy: true, non_promotion_bearing: true`` at the point of
production so a copied artifact carries the stamp with it.

THE FOUR REFUSALS THIS HARNESS EXISTS TO MAKE (each is a typed error, never a warning)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. **Minimum-usable fold** (§9.2).  After purge+embargo a fold must retain >= 60
   distinct train dates and >= 10 distinct test dates.  Today's graded frame is 24
   dates, so EVERY fold on it refuses — that refusal is the acceptance behaviour, not
   a bug to route around.  The harness never silently shrinks a fold.
2. **PIT contamination** (§9.1, §4.2).  A feature whose registry member is
   ``snapshot_not_pit`` or ``forward_only`` cannot be joined into a BACKTEST frame:
   short interest and forensics are snapshot-only today, and a snapshot join writes
   today's knowledge onto a historical row.
3. **Composite ingestion** (§5.2).  ``conviction`` / ``composite_z`` / hub scores enter
   only decomposed to their legs.  ``forbidden_composites`` in the registry is the
   kill list, and the refusal names the decomposition the caller must use instead.
4. **Unregistered feature** (§5.1).  A column in no family is refused, which is what
   makes the registry the law rather than documentation: the anti-double-count budget
   (§10.6) is meaningless if a feature can enter without a family.

WHY THE NORMALIZER IS A CLASS AND NOT A FUNCTION.  §9.1b: every normalization,
percentile, winsorization or reference distribution is fit on the TRAINING FOLD ONLY
and carried forward frozen.  A function that takes a frame and returns transformed
values has nowhere to put "the parameters are frozen and came from these rows" — so
the leak (fitting on the full frame) is invisible in a diff.  Freezing the parameters
in an object makes the leak a visible field, and lets a test pin it by mutating the
test fold and asserting the parameters did not move.

Usage::

    python3 -m scripts.prophet_fusion_arena --selftest          # the end-to-end proof
    python3 -m scripts.prophet_fusion_arena --survey            # real frame, honest depth
    python3 -m scripts.prophet_fusion_arena --check-registry    # families.yml is lawful
