"""scripts/signal_foundry_accrue.py — nightly forward-accrual runner (SF-R4).

Called from the daily.yml engine job after the causal commit step.  Calls
engine.signal_foundry.results.accrue_forward(repo_root, asof=today) and
prints a one-line summary.

Exits 0 even on internal errors (prints ::warning instead).  This is required
by the nightly-ledger law (SF-R4): failure of the accrual step must never
block the rest of the nightly pipeline.
