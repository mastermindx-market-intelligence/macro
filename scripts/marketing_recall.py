"""scripts/marketing_recall.py — pull back posts that are booked but not yet sent.

THE HOLE THIS CLOSES.
`publish.max_forward_book_min` (#3913, 2026-07-28) let one publish sweep book
several posts ahead as Buffer `customScheduled` sends, up to an hour out. That
decoupled throughput from the cron grid, which was the point — but it also
quietly broke the operator kill switch. `MARKETING_PUBLISH_ENABLED=0` stops the
runner from creating NEW posts; it has no reach at all into posts already handed
to Buffer, which fire on Buffer's schedule regardless.

It bit the same day it shipped. A sweep at 16:25:46Z booked five posts for
16:31 / 16:41 / 16:56 / 17:12 / 17:27Z. The operator found quality defects and
disarmed the publisher at 16:26:47Z — ONE MINUTE later — and it changed nothing.
All five were already in Buffer's queue; three of them were posts already
identified as defective; the only recall available was the operator deleting
them by hand in the Buffer UI. This runner is the missing half of that switch.

WHAT "RECALLABLE" MEANS — the safety core, and the only part worth arguing about.
An item is a candidate if and only if ALL of:
  1. its folded outbox status is `posted`;
  2. its `posted` ledger row carries a receipt with a non-empty `external_id`
     (the Buffer post id — without it there is nothing to cancel); and
  3. the wall-clock it was BOOKED for (receipt `booked_at`, falling back to the
     receipt/row `at`) is STRICTLY IN THE FUTURE relative to `now`.
Rule 3 is what keeps an already-sent post out of reach. An unparseable or
missing send time is NOT a candidate either — fail closed; we never delete
something whose send time we cannot read. And the item only leaves `posted` on a
CONFIRMED backend delete (DeleteResult.ok): a delete that errors, times out, or
comes back ambiguous leaves the item exactly where it was, reported as failed.

Together those give the two guarantees the outbox depends on:
  * a genuinely-sent post is never resurrected — it stays `posted` forever, so
    posted_today_by_account keeps counting it and no cap is silently refilled;
  * a recalled post can never re-send — `recalled` is TERMINAL in
    outbox.TRANSITIONS, with no edge back to approved or queued.

WHY THIS IS NOT GATED ON THE KILL SWITCH.
scripts/marketing_publisher.py self-downgrades to dry-run unless
MARKETING_PUBLISH_ENABLED is on. This runner deliberately does NOT. Recall is a
STOP action, not a send action, and the moment an operator most needs it is the
moment they have just switched the publisher off. Gating recall on the arm
variable would make it inoperable in precisely the situation it exists for. The
safety here comes from `--live` (dry-run is the default) plus the candidate
rules above — never from the arm state.

Usage:
    # dry-run (default): print exactly what WOULD be recalled, ZERO network calls
    python -m scripts.marketing_recall --recall-pending
    python -m scripts.marketing_recall --ids out-abc123,out-def456
    python -m scripts.marketing_recall --as-of 2026-07-28 --account flagship

    # LIVE recall — one action, everything booked-but-unsent:
    BUFFER_TOKEN=... python -m scripts.marketing_recall --recall-pending --live

Exit codes: 0 = nothing to do, or every attempted recall succeeded.
            1 = at least one delete FAILED — posts the operator asked to stop are
                still scheduled to go out. That is an incident, so it is red.
