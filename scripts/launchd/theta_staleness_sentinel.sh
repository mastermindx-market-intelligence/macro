#
# Staleness sentinel for the ThetaData EOD store. Installed 2026-07-20 after a
# 3-day silent stall (terminal died Fri evening 07-17; nothing alarmed until a
# human noticed frozen options planes on 07-20).
#
# Checks two things and ALERTS on either:
#   1. Terminal health — :25503 not answering, OR answering 200 with a trivial
#      body on /v3/option/list/symbols (a terminal on a stale/revoked
#      THETA_API_KEY stays up as a ZOMBIE serving empty 200s while real data
#      endpoints time out — bit live 2026-07-20; a bare status-code check
#      stayed green through it). Either shape means the whole lane is dead
#      ahead of the next post-close window (leading indicator).
#   2. Store staleness — latest date in greeks/SPY/{YYYY}.parquet vs the last
#      session that SHOULD be there. sessions_missing counts NYSE weekday
#      sessions from (latest+1) .. today, including today only when invoked
#      with --due-today (evening lane, after the 16:10 ET close pull window).
#      ALERT at >= 2 missing sessions, WARN at 1. (US market holidays are not
#      special-cased — a holiday can inflate the count by 1, which the WARN
#      tier absorbs; the ALERT tier only false-fires if a holiday AND a real
#      miss stack, which is exactly when a human look is cheap.)
#   3. (AD-1T1 F8, threshold fixed RF1/R3) Daily-refresh anchor —
#      `_manifest.json`'s `daily_refresh.D` is the incremental daily lane's
#      own liveness record. ALERT when it is not today's NYSE session date
#      (`lib.nyse_calendar.session_date()`) after 20:00 ET on a session day:
#      launchd calendar fires do not wake a sleeping Mac and COALESCE on
#      wake, so a sleeping/missed host is otherwise indistinguishable from a
#      healthy one. This sentinel's OWN two fire points are 06:15/18:30 PT =
#      09:15/21:30 ET — the original 22:00 ET threshold made the check DEAD
#      (neither fire ever lands after 22:00 ET, so anchor_due was always
#      False); 20:00 ET sits strictly before the 21:30 ET evening fire so
#      that fire is the one that actually evaluates the anchor.
#
# Outputs (all append/atomic-write, never touches the parquet store):
#   /tmp/theta_staleness.json  — machine-readable latest verdict
#   /tmp/theta_staleness.log   — append-only history
#   macOS notification via osascript on WARN/ALERT (operator works on this Mac)
