"""General point-in-time Prophet session replay harness.

DESIGN OF RECORD: ``research/PROPHET_PIT_REPLAY_HARNESS_V1.md``.
AUTHORITY: ``agentos/decisions/DEC-FORCE-MAJEURE-SESSIONS-ARE-BACKFILLED-BY-DEFAULT.md``
(chairman, 2026-08-18) — backfilling an infrastructure-outage-lost Prophet session is
the DEFAULT; reconstructed rows enter the forward ledger UNMARKED (no
``origination_mode`` stamp, no disclosure chip — the operator explicitly declined that
flag and the DEC records the accepted cost).

THIS IS THE GENERAL PRODUCER the DEC names as the removed blocker.
``scripts/backfill_prophet_outage.py`` (2026-08-09) and
``scripts/backfill_prophet_outage_20260811.py`` (2026-08-11) are ONE-OFF, per-event
lanes — hard-pinned constants, a bespoke disclosure document, ``origination_mode``
stamps.  Every primitive that made those lanes honest (structural price truncation, a
mandatory control pass, fail-closed board-identity stamps, atomic writes, -z porcelain
parsing, a result-keyed board cache) is LIFTED here, generalized so it is parameterized
by ``(market, session)`` instead of a hard-pinned event, and DE-MARKED so it produces
plain forward-ledger rows rather than a disclosed backfill.  Read the ancestor
(``scripts/backfill_prophet_outage_20260811.py``) for the reasoning behind each
primitive; this module's docstrings summarize rather than repeat it in full.

WHAT CHANGED VS THE ANCESTORS, AND WHY IT IS SAFE TO GENERALIZE (masterplan intro):
1. The DEC removes the per-event charter and the row marking, so the disclosure
   document, ``DISCLOSURE_COPY`` chips, ``origination_mode`` stamps and the
   bidirectional segregation tests do NOT transfer.  Receipts (the operational audit
   trail) DO.
2. Every event-pinned constant becomes DERIVED: the vintage SHA comes from the bake
   slot, the control reference comes from the vintage's own committed board, the
   required ranker is READ from that board (never hardcoded), and the fidelity floor
   and price surface come from a per-market registry (``MARKETS`` below).
3. The mandatory control pass is the safety net that makes generalization honest: a
   market whose declared price surface is incomplete FAILS its control fidelity floor
   and refuses to mint, rather than silently minting on an under-covered universe.

WHAT IT WRITES / NEVER WRITES (masterplan §0.4, §3) — stage-and-absorb, not a direct
forward-ledger write:
  writes (--execute):
    US only:  site/prophet/plans/<ID>.json                    (surviving minted plans)
              data/prophet/origination_receipts/replay-<session>-<hash>.json
    all markets:
              data/pit_replay/attempts/<market>-<session>.json
                (durable operation intent; removed only after exact final validation,
                 retained as effect-unknown evidence after any partial publication)
              <market's pending_dir>/<session>.json            (pit_replay.pending/v1)
              data/pit_replay/<market>-<session>-<hash>.json   (harness receipt)
  NEVER:      data/prophet/ledger.jsonl, data/china_standout_track/board.parquet,
              data/us_board_ledger/snapshots*.jsonl / retro_grades*.parquet,
              any data/hk_pick_lab/ graded store, site/prophet/index.json,
              site/prophet/states/*, or ANY site/factordata/* artifact (a reconstructed
              board is never published).  Each market's OWN nightly absorbs its
              pending dir through its OWN append + dedupe machinery — for US that
              absorb hook lives in ``scripts/grade_us_board.py``'s ``--nightly`` path.

ENGINE GATES ARE UNTOUCHED (masterplan §0.8).  ``originate_plans``, ``select_candidates``,
the six-clock chronology contract, the integrity layer and the chronology audit are
imported and called on their own terms, never modified.  A gate that refuses at
execution time has its refusal recorded in the receipt, never overridden.

Run (dry run — prints the would-enter set with per-name provenance, writes nothing):

    python3 -m scripts.prophet_pit_replay --market us --session 2026-08-14

``--resolve-only`` prints the vintage resolution + gap check + registry validation and
exits — cheap, no board build.  ``--control`` (default on) additionally rebuilds the
vintage's OWN committed board and reports harness fidelity; required for a run that
mints anything, unless ``--allow-low-fidelity``.  ``--execute`` writes the artifacts.
``--verify-collisions`` re-derives the US collision set against fresh ``origin/main``
and exits nonzero on any NEW collision — run it immediately before merge.

#
# Wide panels: ``data/china_search/closes.parquet`` and
# ``data/hk_search/closes_deep.parquet`` are TRACKED (verified via
# ``git ls-files``) wide close panels (DatetimeIndex, ticker columns) read
# directly by each market's ``universe()``/global-beta leg. The gitignored
# ``_closes_cache.parquet`` aux caches (``.gitignore:90-91``) are the CN/HK
# analogues of US's ``russell_breadth`` cache — absent from every git commit by
# construction, so ``--aux-panel-source`` is the only way a replay can see them;
# ``aux_panel_dirnames`` below names the parent dirs eligible for that
# substitution. ``data/china_search/members.parquet`` and
# ``data/china_breadth/constituents.parquet`` / ``data/hk_breadth/constituents
# .parquet`` are DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED from both surfaces: they are
# ticker-indexed metadata tables (index=ticker, columns=name/sector — verified
# by reading them), never date-indexed, so ``_fence_index``/``overlay_sessions``
# have nothing to truncate on them (name/sector membership is not a PIT-sensitive
# price quantity); declaring them would only ever mark them "unscannable" for
# zero benefit.
#
# HK's price surface additionally carries ``data/china_search/closes.parquet``
# (already declared for CN): ``engine/hk_ah.py:150-165`` (``ah_by_ticker``) reads
# it directly for the A-share leg of the A/H value-dislocation signal, which
# feeds ``hk_stock_signals.hk_edge()`` and therefore HK board admission
# (scripts/build_hk_library.py:1298-1300). Declaring it for HK too lets the
# fence/overlay cover a genuine (if secondary) HK admission input; omitting it
# would only ever leave the file at its vintage bytes (the safe direction, never
# lookahead) but would understate control-pass fidelity for names near the A/H
# premium threshold.
