"""Seed data/baskets_china_ths/membership.json — A-share baskets mirroring 同花顺 (THS) themes.

The machine-maintained sibling of scripts/seed_china_baskets.py. Instead of hand-picking members,
this adopts 同花顺's own thematic taxonomy: a CURATED subset of THS concept boards (概念板块) and
THS's live member lists for each, fetched by collectors.china_ths_concepts. We curate only WHICH
themes to carry (id / English label / category / thesis); the *members* are THS's, verbatim.

POINT-IN-TIME, accumulated forward: each run reads every dated snapshot in
data/baskets_china_ths/snapshots/ and diffs them, so a member's `added` is the first snapshot it
appeared in and `removed` is when THS dropped it. On the FIRST run there is only one snapshot, so
every current member is seeded at SEED (the china_search cache start) — the same HINDSIGHT-curated,
descriptive treatment the curated baskets carry (membership-as-of-today applied over the window,
honestly labelled, not an out-of-sample backtest). As snapshots accumulate the history becomes
genuinely point-in-time.

Universe = the FREE china_search top-market-cap A-share close cache (~1,500 names, ~5y). THS themes
include a small-cap tail outside that cache; those names are dropped (recorded under `missing`) and
a theme with <3 covered members is skipped. Benchmark = CSI 300 (沪深300, the 510300.SS ETF).

Re-runnable: `python -m scripts.seed_china_ths_baskets [--refresh]`  (--refresh re-fetches a
today snapshot before building; otherwise the latest existing snapshot is used, or one is fetched
if none exists).

SNAPSHOT DIRECTORY IS MIXED-SHAPE (GMI W1b): data/baskets_china_ths/snapshots/ carries both raw
vendor dumps and byte-copies of membership.json under the same dated filenames. Every read here
classifies by parsed CONTENT (classify_snapshot_shape) and uses raw dumps only, and the write is
additionally interlocked against a mass deletion of the auto-imported `thsc*` taxonomy — see
SHAPE_RAW_DUMP / MAX_AUTO_SHRINK below.

# Reading the second as the first is what deletes the taxonomy: the auto-import loop below
# enumerates the NEWEST snapshot's keys, and a membership doc's keys are
# `version`/`seed_date`/`baskets` — no concept among them — so every auto-imported `thsc*`
