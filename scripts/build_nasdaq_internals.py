"""Build the Nasdaq-100 archetype-group internals artifact.

Emits site/marketdata/nasdaq_internals.json — a descriptive rotation-state snapshot
over the 7 tech-archetype groups defined in data/baskets_nasdaq/membership.json.

DISPLAY-ONLY / DESCRIPTIVE. No forecast. Pure deterministic computation; no LLM.
Rulings: TI-R1..R7 (adjudication PR #1805, program nasdaq-internals).

Key properties:
  - Null-honest: missing prices → valid all-null artifact; never raises.
  - Prior artifact read for 2-day hysteresis state machine.
  - Additive: does not touch any existing oracle, engine/oracle, or scripts/oracle_*.

Run:
    python -m scripts.build_nasdaq_internals

        unchanged asof timestamp correctly triggers the synapse freshness SLA,
        providing honest staleness signaling without data loss.
      - The all-null (degraded) payload is written only when no valid non-degraded
        prior exists.

        rule fires so CI/monitoring surfaces the outage.  It must NOT go through
