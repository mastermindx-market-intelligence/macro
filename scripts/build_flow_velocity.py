    ``engine.flow_observatory.workflow``'s pure functions do the actual computation;
    this is wiring only.

    S9 repair (W6 review round): also RETURNS the desk's own covered/scored ticker
    universe (``kmap``'s keys — the same set every member ticker is checked against
    below via ``t in kmap``) so the caller can thread it into the template render as
    ``known_tickers`` for ``workflow.terminal_link`` (spec §4's own "closest available
    proxy for has a Terminal page"). Reusing this function's own already-computed
    ``kmap`` avoids a further recompute of the flow panel purely for this purpose — an
    empty set on any early-return path (import failure, no flow panel) degrades to "no
    ticker is known", which the template's ``nameln`` macro handles by rendering every
    member unlinked rather than raising.

    OWNED-FILES scope keeps this assembly OUT of engine/flow_velocity.py and
    engine/flow_observatory/groups.py (same boundary ``_official_sectors_panel``
    already documents), so ``wide``/``kmap``/membership are recomputed a THIRD time in
    this build (once inside ``flow_velocity.snapshot()``, once inside
    ``_official_sectors_panel``, once here) — the added wall-clock cost is measured and
    reported in the PR body's performance note, matching the precedent
    ``_official_sectors_panel``'s own docstring already accepts for the same reason.

    Official-sector gate: a sector's row only gets a history/episodes panel when its
    OWN ``spark_accrual.ready`` is true (or it already carries a ``spark``) — the W4
    official lens applies TODAY's membership retroactively across the whole flow panel,
    so a REPLAY drawn from that backfill before real accrual covers the window would
    imply a composition depth the membership store has never actually held (the exact
    thing ``engine.flow_observatory.groups.aggregate_lens`` already refuses for the
    single-point spark — replay history for W6 refuses it identically, never a second,
    laxer rule for the SAME data).
