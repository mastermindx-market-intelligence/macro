"""scripts/check_factor_boundaries.py — Factor boundary static guard.

LANE: §D PR-5, RUL-NW9 / RUL-NW11 (NW_INTEGRATION_ADJUDICATION_BY_FABLE.md)

PURPOSE
-------
Static guard that enforces three boundary rules for factor-module files.
Modelled on check_synapse_reads.py and check_research_factory_authority.py
conventions; checks (a)/(c) and the default check-(b) path are literal scans.

THREE CHECKS
------------
(a) Article-2 write guard (RUL-NW9/NW11):
    FAIL if any factor-module file contains a code-level write reference to
    Article-2 surfaces/artifacts:
      - alert_triage
      - board_ordering/us_standouts writes (board_ordering path fragment)
      - top_setups
      - push_floor
      - attention_queue
    Factor modules scanned:
      scripts/build_factor_panel.py
      scripts/build_factor_intelligence_state.py
      scripts/build_factor_deescalation_shadow.py
      engine/neuralweb/factor_contradictions.py
      engine/neuralweb/kernel_style.py  (if present)
    Note: comment lines and docstring lines are skipped (the guard forbids code
    references, not documentation notes that enumerate forbidden surfaces).

(b) allowed_actions read guard (RUL-NW9):
    FAIL if 'allowed_actions' is READ anywhere outside an explicit allowlist.
    The state builder may emit the field (it's the producer); display surfaces
    and admin may read it; everything else must not touch it.
    Allowlisted paths (may read 'allowed_actions'):
      scripts/build_factor_intelligence_state.py    (producer — emits the block)
      scripts/build_factor_deescalation_shadow.py   (internal guard check)
      tests/                                         (test files; prefix match)
      admin/neural_web.py
      admin/static/app.js
      templates/factors.html.j2
      scripts/build_site.py
      engine/neuralweb/cortex.py
      engine/neuralweb/ask_brain.py
      engine/sector_intelligence/contracts.py      (enforcement-only validator)
      engine/biocatalyst/sector_packet.py          (facts-only packet state builder)
      docs/research/                                 (research docs; prefix match)
      scripts/check_factor_boundaries.py             (this file — for selftest)
    Two inflation producers have occurrence-only AST warrants for their exact
    six-key all-False emissions; they are not allowlisted to read the field.

(c) Forbidden field name guard (rank/score/recommendation):
    FAIL if the state builder or shadow script emit fields named
    'rank', 'score', or 'recommendation' as dictionary key literals.
    Detects patterns like: "rank":  'score':  ["recommendation"]
    in those two specific files.  This is a belt-and-suspenders guard
    against accidentally introducing origination-adjacent field names.
    Comment and docstring lines are skipped.

SCAN SCOPE
----------
  engine/*.py, scripts/*.py, collectors/*.py
  Plus factor-module-specific files listed above.

Exit codes
----------
  0 : No violations found (or selftest passed).
  1 : One or more HARD violations found.

Usage
-----
  python scripts/check_factor_boundaries.py [--root PATH] [--selftest]

Pattern note
------------
Checks (a) and (c) are literal scans. Check (b) uses a narrow AST exception for
fixed all-false authority-mirror emissions in two named inflation producers;
all other paths retain the literal scan. Dynamic path construction without the
matching literal is NOT detected.
