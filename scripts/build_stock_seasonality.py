"""Publish the stock-seasonality calendar clock (Lane 1 + Lane 2 + selection).

Writes ``site/seasonalitydata/index.json`` and one
``site/seasonalitydata/entities/<SYMBOL>.json`` per covered symbol, exactly per
``research/STOCK_SEASONALITY_LANE2_DESIGN_SPEC.md`` §9.

Three properties are worth knowing before editing this file:

* **The universe is measured, never listed.** ``config/seasonality_universe.yml``
  carries a threshold and a scope fence; membership comes from counting complete
  years in ``data/yahoo/`` on every run.
* **The selection correction is cached for a year.** The window family, its
  independent circular year-shift null, and the Westfall-Young adjusted p-values
  all depend on the COMPLETE-year panel, which changes once per calendar year.
  The cache key is the panel's own hash, so a vendor re-adjustment of old prices
  invalidates it even though no year boundary moved. Without this, B=2000 x 2645
  windows x 2 panels x ~290 symbols would run every night for a result that is
  identical 364 nights out of 365.
* **Fail-open per symbol.** A bad parquet, a short history, or a degenerate
  panel logs and continues. ``main`` never raises and always returns 0; a
  seasonality page is context, and taking the nightly down for it would be a
  worse outcome than a missing symbol.

Nothing here ranks symbols against each other, and nothing here emits a
forecast, a score, or a Neural Web state.
