"""scripts/backfill_regime_stamps.py — Thin wrapper for qledger regime stamp backfill.

Calls engine.qledger.backfill_regime_stamps() which has NO CLI. Near-term yield
≈ 2 rows (only rows with as_of >= 2026-07-01 can be stamped from regime_vector.parquet).

This script is a resilient daily.yml step. It is a WRAPPER ONLY — all logic lives
in engine/qledger.py:backfill_regime_stamps().
