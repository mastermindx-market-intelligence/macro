"""scripts/hot_tape_radar.py — the */5 intraday Hot Tape radar.

Implements research/MARKETING_HOT_TAPE_MASTERPLAN.md §3.2/§3.4: load the live
tape + the nightly context pack, run the detectors
(:func:`engine.marketing.hot_tape.detect_events`), compose wire copy
(:func:`engine.marketing.hot_tape_wire.compose_wire`), draw the house tape card,
and book the result as an `immediate` outbox item so
`marketing-publish.yml post_now_item=<ids>` sends it within minutes.

    python -m scripts.hot_tape_radar [--dry-run] [--demo]

TWO THINGS THE COPY PATH DOES BEYOND THE TEMPLATE (masterplan §10 E1):

* **P2 phrasing.** Every composed post goes through
  :func:`engine.marketing.hot_tape_llm.phrase_or_fallback`, which phrases the
  SAME FactPacket in wire register behind the numeric-consistency gate and
  hands back the deterministic template on any failure. The template is the
  floor, never a hope: `phrase` below can only return postable text.
* **Two-step publish.** An alert at severity >= `two_step.min_severity` earns
  ONE follow-up "context brief" (mechanism + affected names + what we are
  watching), filed on a LATER tick by :func:`pending_briefs`. Codex case study
  2026-07-28: on the same story and account the flash won ~8% more views, the
  contextual version won ~9% better interaction efficiency and a ~49% higher
  repost/view ratio. The alert wins speed; the brief wins reposts.

WHAT THIS LANE MAY WRITE (ledger law, masterplan §6). Only
``data/marketing/outbox/*`` (through ``outbox.enqueue`` + ``media_publish``),
``data/marketing/hot_tape_ring.jsonl`` and ``data/marketing/hot_tape_fired.jsonl``
— both append-only with ``merge=union`` — plus the runner-local, gitignored
parquet cache under ``data/massive_stock_day/``. NEVER a forward ledger, never
``data/chronicle``, never anything the nightly owns. The nightly is the sole
advancer of forward ledgers and this loop runs 81 times a day.

EVERY TICKER POST CARRIES A CHART (operator law, #3921). A single-name event
whose card cannot be drawn AND hosted is DROPPED here, not enqueued: the
publisher's defer queue is not a parking lot, and `kind="breaking"` is outside
its `_CHART_BEARING_KINDS` gate anyway, so a chartless single-name item would
ship BARE. Sector and contrarian events are breadth posts and ship text-only in
P1 (the sector grid card is P1.5).

FAIL TOWARD "NO POST". Every step is never-raise and degrades to booking
nothing; the process exits 0 unless an invariant is genuinely broken. A radar
that crashes 81 times a day is noise, and a radar that posts on a broken read is
worse than one that posts nothing.

Import discipline: pandas is NEVER imported on this path (the workflow installs
pyyaml+requests+pyarrow only). ``chart_render`` reads its parquet through
pyarrow when pandas is absent; ``requests`` and the renderer are imported lazily
inside the functions that need them so the thin test lane can import this module
with pytest+pyyaml alone.

#   * live-quotes.yml's 5-minute tick has been disabled since 2026-07-27T22:50Z
#     (VPS_LIVE_PRIMARY=true gates the job off), leaving only a */15 tape-gate
#     tick that was sized for the publisher's 45-minute gate, not a 12-minute one.
#   * GitHub starves this repo's scheduled workflows: 104 scheduled runs delivered
#     across the WHOLE repo in the 8h RTH window on 2026-07-29 — live-quotes 11 of
#     128 ticks (8.6%), this radar 6 of 92 (6.5%). The writer fired ~1.4x/hour.
#   * two of those eleven delivered live-quotes ticks then died at 8m06s inside

    # contract holds. Nothing about detection, composition or what this lane posts

    # operational prefix. ENTRY_RADAR_NO_PUBLISH=1 stands the spool down for any
    # rehearsal that runs this lane end to end.

    # GATED ON demo AND dry_run, deliberately — the two-line W1 sketch was not.

    # relaxed freshness ceiling, so its detections are real code paths over an
    # unreal tape; spooled, they would enter the accrual stream carrying
    # data_quality="ok" and a vintage that reads as current, and
    # engine/entry_radar/spool.py is explicit that a fabricated row joined to real
    # closes is indistinguishable from a genuine one forever. `--dry-run` is gated

    # emit and dispatch_ids are all `if not dry_run`): a rehearsal that silently
    # published to a private operational prefix would be the one write a dry run
    # did not disclose. ENTRY_RADAR_NO_PUBLISH stays the operator-side stand-down;
    # this is the caller-side one, and it needs no environment to be right.
