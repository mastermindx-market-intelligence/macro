"""The evening close pass's PRIMARY clock — host-native, launchd-fired (PR-B).

WHY A HOST CLOCK AT ALL. ``.github/workflows/close-pass.yml`` was the product
clock until 2026-08-15 and cannot be one. Measured Friday 2026-08-14: the
20:25 UTC cron line's run was CREATED at 20:52 — 27 minutes of pure scheduler
drift before a runner was even asked for — and its DST sibling at 21:47 then sat
95 minutes in the queue on the two-host `macstudio` pool. The board published
~19:20 ET against a 16:15 ET product target. That is not a slow job; it is a
clock that does not tick when it says it will, and the estate has measured the
same thing at larger scale: GitHub cron gaps of 90 min to 3 h 12 m
(``agentos/decisions/DEC-LER-LIVE-LANE-VPS-5MIN-REST.md``), which is why Live
Entry Radar's live lane runs off a VPS timer rather than Actions.

So the roles swap. This runner is the primary: ``launchd`` on the Mac Studio
fires it at 13:00 local (PT) Monday-Friday, which is 16:00 ET in both DST
regimes because both zones flip together. The workflow stays armed as a BOUNDED
BACKSTOP — it fast-exits when this lane already landed the session's board, and
announces loudly when it had to publish, so a silently-dead primary is visible
in the Actions log rather than only in a missing artifact.

WHAT THIS FILE IS, AND IS NOT. It is PLUMBING: locking, a fresh checkout, a
venv, an env file, a bounded wait, one subprocess, one discard, one receipt. It
computes nothing about the market and decides nothing about the board. Every
POLICY question — is today a session, is this session already published, which
names are admitted, what gets written where — belongs to
``scripts.close_pass_publish`` running out of a checkout this runner resets to
``origin/main`` immediately beforehand. That split is deliberate and it is the
same one ``scripts/prophet_rescue_launchd.py`` makes: the wrapper is frozen at
install time, the policy it launches is always current.

TWO COPIES OF THIS FILE RUN, WITH DIFFERENT JOBS — by design, not by accident:

  * ``$SUPPORT_DIR/close_pass_host_runner.py`` — installed by
    ``scripts/install_closepass_launchd.sh`` and executed by launchd with the
    system ``/usr/bin/python3``. It lives OUTSIDE ``~/Documents`` because launchd
    jobs cannot exec from there (the same wall ``ops/launchd/com.macro.chainheat.plist``
    documents). It is frozen at install time; re-run the installer after editing
    this file. MERGING A FIX TO THIS FILE DEPLOYS NOTHING (measured 2026-08-18,
    PR #5862). Every receipt therefore carries a ``bootstrap`` block naming the
    executing snapshot, and every run GRADES it against origin/main out loud.
  * ``<lane>/scripts/close_pass_host_runner.py --probe-close`` — the SAME file
    at ``origin/main`` vintage, run by the lane's venv python inside the lane
    checkout. Only this copy imports repo code, which is why the outer runner
    never has to import pandas to ask whether the closes have settled.

Stdlib only, no repo imports, no third-party package: the outer half must run on
a bare system python3 under launchd.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/close_pass_host_runner.py              # one pass
  python3 scripts/close_pass_host_runner.py --dry-run    # compute, publish nothing
  python3 scripts/close_pass_host_runner.py --now 2026-08-14T20:00:00Z
  python3 -m scripts.close_pass_host_runner --probe-close --session 2026-08-14

#
#   * the LANE's ``code_sha`` — a 40-hex GIT COMMIT, hard-reset to origin/main on
#     every run. It reports today's main even when the code computing it is weeks
#     old, which is the direction that makes it dangerous.
#   * this BOOTSTRAP — the snapshot launchd execs out of Application Support,
#     whose only vintage is the BYTES ON DISK. ``install_closepass_launchd.sh``
#     copies it at install time ON PURPOSE (a mid-day push to main must not change
#     what the clock executes), so a merged fix to this file sits inert until an
#     operator re-runs the installer.
#
# MEASURED 2026-08-18: PR #5862 fixed prepare_lane's timeout blindness and merged
# as af416e4a1066; the installed snapshot stayed byte-identical to the PRE-fix
# main, dated Aug 15 19:54, with ``grep -c _git_probe`` returning 0 on it. That
# evening's receipt looked perfect — ``code_sha`` was af416e4a — and the one
# bootstrap field it carried, ``runner_sha``, was compared to nothing at all.
#
# So the block is NAMESPACED and every digest key says what it hashed:
# ``receipt["code_sha"]`` is a git commit, ``receipt["bootstrap"]["file_sha256"]``
# is a content digest of a file. The two 12-hex prefixes they replaced were
# indistinguishable side by side in a real receipt; these cannot be.
