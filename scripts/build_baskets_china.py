"""Build the China thematic-baskets page -> site/baskets_china.html (+ chinabasketdata/baskets.json).

The A-share analogue of scripts/build_baskets.py. Reads data/baskets_china/membership.json +
the china_search close cache + the CSI 300 ETF via engine.baskets_china.compute_china_baskets()
and renders the same FactorWatch-style baskets view (sortable performance table, interactive
overlay chart, per-category cards + member drill), benchmarked to the CSI 300 (沪深300).
Additive — any failure logs and returns 0 so it can never break the rest of the site.

Usage: python -m scripts.build_baskets_china
