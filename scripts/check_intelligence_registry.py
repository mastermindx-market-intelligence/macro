"""scripts/check_intelligence_registry.py — the engine-registry structural validator (T1).

WHAT THIS IS
------------
A PURE STRUCTURAL VALIDATOR over a registry it derives IN MEMORY. There is no committed
``data/intelligence_registry.json`` and no generated Markdown mirror, so this script has no
drift comparison, no ``--check`` equality mode and no "stale artifact" violation. It cannot
be reddened by an event no PR author caused: nothing it reads is pinned by equality.

Two earlier rounds shipped exactly that pin — first against ``data/qledger/claims.jsonl``,
then against ``config/synapse.yml``. Both were scheduled fleet-wide reds. Measured on FULL
HISTORY 2026-08-14 (unshallowed clone): 70 and 69 commits respectively in the trailing 14
days. The figures those rounds cited (13 and 26) came off a SHALLOW clone and understated
the churn by 5.4x and 2.7x — which strengthens the conclusion rather than softening it.
There is no stable input to pin against, so nothing is pinned.

THE INVARIANTS (law ``epistemics.engine_authority_evidence``)
------------------------------------------------------------
  1. PARTITION — every synapse artifact maps to exactly one engine or to exactly one
     explicit ``not_an_engine`` exclusion that records what it deletes.
  2. OVERLAY — no key outside the four-key allowlist, no DERIVED key, no orphan row, no
     ``graded_by_design: yes`` assertion, and no removal of an authority-bearing or
     evaluated cell via ``not_an_engine``.
  3. ATTRIBUTION — every authority value names the derivation rule AND the artifact(s)
     that produced it, and those artifacts really carry that authority.
  4. C-1 — every artifact above ``display`` authority whose ``qual_ladder_ref`` is MISSING
     or UNRESOLVABLE is REPORTED. ``unchecked`` (the resolver had no inputs) is its own
     bucket and is never counted as evidence.

FAIL CLOSED
-----------
A previous round printed "0 integrity violation(s)" when it could not read its inputs —
"I could not look" rendered as "I looked and it was clean", in the one line a CI reader
sees. The summary line here ALWAYS carries an ``inputs=`` clause; when anything was
unreadable it reads ``inputs=INCOMPLETE`` and NAMES what was missed.

A PR-PLANE INCOMPLETE READ EXITS NON-ZERO ON EVERY RUN, WITH OR WITHOUT ``--strict``
(ruling 2026-08-14, amended the same day — see JURISDICTION). It is a RUN-LEVEL defect —
the guard failed to do its job — not a condition of the corpus, so it is not the kind of
thing an advisory tier exists to soften. Making it conditional on a flag nobody passes in
CI meant the fail-closed channel printed a warning and returned success, which is the same
green a clean run returns. Structural violations exit non-zero for the same reason: they
are properties of the derivation and of the hand-edited overlay, green by construction on
arrival, so they cannot fire fleet-wide for nobody's fault.

JURISDICTION — A PR LANE MAY ONLY GATE WHAT A PR ACTOR CAN BREAK
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The first form of the ruling above gated on ANY incomplete read, which handed a nightly
lane the power to red every PR in flight: ONE truncated line in
``data/qledger/claims.jsonl`` — 1 of 46,696, appended by the nightly, touched by no PR
author — reddened the whole ``intelligence-registry`` job. That is the scheduled-fleet-red
shape this program has been refuted for three rounds running, arriving through the fix for
a different one.

So the exit code is keyed on the PLANE that went blind
(``scripts/build_intelligence_registry.py`` :data:`DATA_PLANE_INPUTS`):

  PR-PLANE (``synapse.yml``, the overlay, ``qual_ladder.yml``, ``species/registry.json``,
     the Article-2 module table, producer SOURCE) — all config and code, all moved only by
     a pull request. Blindness here EXITS 1 on every run. A PR author can cause it and a PR
     author can fix it.
  DATA-PLANE (``data/qledger/claims.jsonl`` alone — the only input an automated lane
     advances) — blindness here is ALWAYS REPRESENTED: named on the summary line with its
     count, carried in the ``COULD NOT LOOK`` annotation and in the ``--json``
     ``unreadable_inputs``/``unreadable_by_plane``. It exits non-zero only under
     ``--strict``, because the PR lane must not go red fleet-wide for a store no PR author
     touched.

REPRESENTATION IS NOT WEAKENED BY THIS, ONLY THE EXIT CODE IS. Nothing is hidden; a
corrupted claim store is as loud as it ever was, in every mode. The strict lane is where it
gates, and wiring a nightly-side ``--strict`` run is deliberately DEFERRED to the T7 wave —
until that lands, corruption of the claim store alerts but does not gate anywhere.

``--strict`` keeps its own distinct meaning — content FINDINGS also red, plus the
data-plane — and stays reserved for T7's promotion era.

SEVERITY
--------
Registered at ``warn``, not ``hard``, deliberately — see the entry's notes in
``config/house_law_checks.yml``. The dominant output is the pre-existing C-1 backlog, and a
gate that reds the fleet on first wiring for a condition nobody introduced gets routed
around instead of obeyed. ``--strict`` is the promotion lever T7 pulls once the backlog is
drained. That leniency covers FINDINGS only: a run that could not read its inputs is not a
lenient case, it is a run that did not happen.

Annotations are emitted with a bare ``print`` and ``flush=True`` per CLAUDE.md §"GitHub
annotations must START the line" — a logger would prefix the line and GitHub would silently
drop it.

# malformed store — needs a real directory, so this writes the smallest root that reads
# COMPLETE. A control then flips exactly one input and can attribute the result to that
# flip.
#
# The suites IMPORT this rather than growing their own copy. Two fixture corpora is how
# two definitions of "a complete input set" drift apart, and the one that drifts is
# always the one the gate is not run against.
#
# It also gives the suites a C-1 finding and a derived exclusion BY CONSTRUCTION, which is
# what let the live-corpus assertions move off config/synapse.yml: a test that needs "at
# least one unevidenced authority artifact" must not be asking the live tree for one — the
# C-1 backlog is the thing T7 exists to DRAIN, and draining it would have reddened the lane
# that reported it.
