"""PR-2 — the C2 regularized evidence-family harness + the §5.3 redundancy plane.

WHAT THIS IS.  Masterplan §8.1 rung **C2** (elastic-net over typed FAMILY features, group
budget structural, monotonic non-negative signs where a family carries a filed direction)
plus the §5.3 pre-registered redundancy / estimability / incremental measurement plane,
with §9.2's minimum-usable-fold rule enforced at the fit seam.

WHAT TODAY'S FRAME ANSWERS.  On the graded-board frame (§8.5 frame 2, 24 dates) the
INFERENTIAL half is **REFUSED**: 24 dates cannot yield one lawful fold at a 21-session
embargo, so the C2 fit and the cross-fitted incremental estimates emit the §9.2 refusal
VERBATIM and no coefficients.  That refusal is the result, not a gap in the harness — the
machinery is complete and is PROVEN end to end on synthetic depth by ``--selftest`` and by
``tests/test_prophet_fusion_c2.py``.  The descriptive plane (census, redundancy blocks,
conditional mutual information, in-sample partial correlations, power arithmetic) IS
computable today and is what this report carries.

THE FIVE THINGS THIS MODULE REFUSES TO DO
-----------------------------------------
1. **Fit without a lawful fold.**  There is no in-sample fallback fit anywhere in this
   file.  :func:`fit_c2_over_folds` raises when handed an empty fold plan, and the CLI
   path calls :func:`folds_for_labels` FIRST.  An in-sample C2 read would be a weaker
   result wearing the strong result's name.
2. **Let a member vote on presence alone.**  The PR-2 registry amendment
   (``semantics.variance_floor`` / ``variance_floor_spec``,
   ``DSC:COVERAGE-FLOOR-MEASURES-PRESENCE-NOT-VARIANCE``) adds a VARIANCE axis beside the
   presence floor.  The floor is READ FROM THE REGISTRY (:func:`load_variance_floor`) and
   is never a constant in this file — a hard-coded floor is a registry that does not bind.
3. **Spend a family budget on a raw member column.**  Every evidence column in the design
   matrix is exactly one family's aggregated score (:func:`assert_family_grain`); a raw
   member column reaching the matrix is a free vote and RAISES by name (§10.6).
4. **Flip a governed sign on outcome data.**  Evidence coefficients are bounded ``>= 0``
   after orientation.  The fit may shrink a family to zero; it may never re-point it
   against its filed direction because the outcomes preferred the other way.
5. **Force a cell.**  Every redundancy / CMI / incremental cell that misses its registered
   minimum is ``NOT_ESTIMABLE`` with the counts that made it so.

Zero authority.  Nothing here ranks, sizes, gates, originates or escalates; the report
carries the all-false authority stanza, ``non_promotion_bearing``, ``counterfactual_replay``
and the frame-2 survivorship labels as TOP-LEVEL keys.

Run::

    python3 -m scripts.prophet_fusion_c2 --out research/prophet_fusion/pr2_c2
    python3 -m scripts.prophet_fusion_c2 --selftest

The report carries no wall-clock stamp on purpose: two runs of the same CLI over the same
repo produce byte-identical JSON, which is the reproducibility receipt.  The date lives in
the companion doc and in git.

    the two references differ in the third decimal and that no verdict turns on the
    difference.  Both halves were false at these block counts: on 15 date-blocks the F5
    cell reads p = 0.0134 under the normal and 0.0268 under t(df=14) — a factor of two —
    which moved its BH-adjusted p from 0.040 to 0.080 and flipped this table's only
    rejection to a non-rejection.  A normal reference on 12-17 blocks is anti-conservative
    exactly where the answer is decided, so the **t** is the instrument and the normal
    rides beside it only for continuity with PR-1b §8.2's paired-delta table.

    right answer:

      * ``syn_pos``    — planted POSITIVE: its oriented score carries a real edge.
      * ``syn_pos_sib``— a CORRELATED SIBLING of ``syn_pos`` inside the same family, so
                         the within-family redundancy block has a pair and the family
                         budget has something to refuse to spend twice.
      * ``syn_anti``   — planted ANTI-oriented under a filed POSITIVE sign, so the nonneg
                         bound has something to pin at 0.0.
      * ``syn_noise``  — no edge: the crossfit CI must COVER zero.
      * ``syn_inert``  — near-constant flag: fires on ~1% of rows and carries two distinct
                         values on only 30% of dates -> VOTE-INERT (falsifier half 1).
      * ``syn_sparse`` — sparse but VARIABLE: fires on exactly 5% of rows on 95% of dates
                         -> PASSES the floor (falsifier half 2).  The 0.95 (not 1.00) is
                         deliberate: it leaves room for the registry-wiring test to move
