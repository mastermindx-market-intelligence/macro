"""Static guard (ui.ms_board_coherence): every rendered Market State board must be
single-snapshot coherent — the verdict word, 0-100 score, meter tick, thesis,
override notes and flip line must all be derivable from ONE
engine/market_state.py snapshot.

Why this exists — 2026-07-07 incident (commit 5bf116a3b3): the 07:27 render
push raced the 07:10 engine-render (7a1c30ced4). The push step's
`git pull --rebase --autostash -X theirs origin main` resolves whole conflict
REGIONS toward the replayed render, so the pushed site/macro.html stitched
upstream's fresh verdict/score ("Mixed" / 56, six tone-good factor rows) to the
replayed run's stale board text ("Risk-off — stress is elevated" thesis +
"Risk Radar forces Risk-off." note) — a pair market_state_snapshot can never
emit: the "forces" note only fires when the radar ceiling < 42, and the caller
then does score = min(score, ceiling), so a "forces" board must bake score <= 41
and verdict Risk-off. ui.template_site_sync (#1807) heals only plain-copy
template assets post-rebase; rendered pages had no coherence guard at all.

Invariants (constants mirrored from engine/market_state.py — _verdict_from_score,
_LABEL, _HEADLINES, _radar_override / _radar_override_intl, _flip_text and the
score-cap block in market_state_snapshot; tests/test_check_ms_board_coherence.py
cross-checks every copy against the engine so they cannot drift):

  (a) verdict word <-> score band: Risk-off <=> score <= 41, Mixed <=> 42..59,
      Risk-on <=> score >= 60. Strict equivalence holds because the snapshot
      pulls the score into a forced verdict's band BEFORE the final re-cap.
  (b) meter tick position == score.
  (c) thesis headline prefix <-> verdict word.
  (d) "... Risk Radar forces Risk-off." note => word Risk-off AND score <= 41
      (intl boards prefix a market name; the note is matched anywhere).
  (e) "Capped at Mixed by the Risk Radar above." note => word != Risk-on AND
      score <= 59.
  (f) any "forced to Risk-off" note => word Risk-off; any "capped at Mixed"
      note => word != Risk-on (stress/dislocation and alert/regime overrides).
  (g) flip-line shape <-> verdict word ("→ Green if" <=> Mixed,
      "→ Mixed if" <=> Risk-on, "→ Mixed when" <=> Risk-off).
  (h) score-path endpoint <-> board score, WHEN they claim the same session:
      the chart's last data-point carries its own date. Other market boards may
      disclose an independent history clock, but macro.html must append its current
      settled measured score. When the last point's date equals the board's
      as-of, the endpoint must carry the board's embedded measured-blend score.
      The displayed dial may legitimately differ when a disclosed policy cap binds.
      Added after the 2026-08-02 operator report: macro.html baked a
      69 / Risk-on gauge beside a Jul 31 endpoint of 66, because the two come
      from artifacts with opposite write policies for one session —
      market_state_audit.log_snapshot is first-write-wins per as-of (a PIT
      ledger must not be rewritten), engine.market_state.persist is
      last-write-wins (every build) — so any session whose recompute moved
      shipped two numbers under one date, with the stamp asserting they matched.
      build_site._ms_history_view now reconciles the DISPLAY endpoint to the
      board (the logged row is left alone); this pins that it stays reconciled.

Only the l-en spans are parsed: EN and ZH share each <p> source line, so a
line-granular rebase stitch cannot split the pair.

Exit 0 on clean (pages without an ms-board are skipped). Exit 1 with a readable
listing on any violation, including a present-but-unparseable board.
