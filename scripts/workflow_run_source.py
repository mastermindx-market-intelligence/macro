"""Resolve a workflow step's effective shell source, seeing through extraction.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
daily.yml sits against GitHub's silent ~512,000-byte workflow processing cap
(2026-08-12 incident: the nightly stranded jobless for ~3h with no error
anywhere — see tests/test_workflow_file_size.py).  The only way to shrink the
file without deleting load-bearing documentation is to extract inline
``run: |`` bodies to ``scripts/ci/<name>.sh``.

But three guards read those bodies STRAIGHT OUT OF THE YAML:

* ``scripts/check_dag_conformance.py`` extracts ``run_py`` / ``brun`` /
  ``python -m`` module invocations and diffs them against ``config/dag.yml``.
* ``tests/test_push_conflict_guard.py`` censuses steps that pull with
  ``--autostash`` and broad-add ``site/``, and asserts a floor plus a
  GATE_REQUIRED membership list.
* ``tests/test_render_options_workspace_scope.py`` asserts on the engine job's
  raw text ordering.

Extracting a body would make it vanish from all three — measured: moving the
two engine blocks out drops 83 modules (``engine.run``, ``scripts.build_site``,
...) from the engine lane, and moving the standout-audit commit step out
deletes a GATE_REQUIRED census member.  Those guards would not fail loudly;
the DAG one would, but the census would simply go BLIND, which is the exact
silent-coverage-loss failure its own comments warn about.

This module is the single seam that keeps extraction invisible to all three.
Every consumer calls ``resolve_run_source`` and gets back the shell source that
step actually executes, whether it lives inline or in a script file.

THE MARKER CONTRACT
-------------------
An extracted script declares its provenance in its first ``MARKER_SCAN_LINES``
lines with the literal ``MARKER`` string.  That marker is what makes the
indirection resolvable, so it is mandatory for anything extracted from now on.

FAIL-CLOSED, ALWAYS
-------------------
A missing file, or a ``scripts/ci`` script with no marker that is not a known
pre-existing helper, RAISES.  It never returns ``run`` unchanged as a
"safe default" and never returns an empty string: silently returning nothing
is precisely the blindness this module exists to prevent — the guard would
report zero modules / zero census members and read GREEN.

The ``LEGACY_UNMARKED`` allowlist pins the ``scripts/ci`` helpers whose files
are not extracted verbatim step bodies. They are invoked as whole-step bodies
today (including ``nightly_timings_finish.sh``, ``public_render.sh``, and the
atomic options publisher) or sourced from inside other bodies
(``push_retry.sh``, ``strip_conflict_markers.sh``). Their contents are not
workflow step source, so they pass through unchanged.
