"""One-off force-majeure RECONSTRUCTION of the missing 2026-08-11 Prophet US origination.

DESIGN OF RECORD: ``research/PROPHET_OUTAGE_BACKFILL_2026_08.md`` — §0 acceptance gates
and §3 mechanism transfer; §0.4 (collision law: live wins, window closes at MERGE) is
adapted verbatim.  Operator order 2026-08-13, a second force-majeure override of the
forward-ledger no-backfill law, scoped to EXACTLY ONE missing origination event.

THIS IS THE 2026-08-11 SIBLING OF ``scripts/backfill_prophet_outage.py`` (PR #5305,
the 2026-08-09 event), NOT a generalisation of it.  Each outage is chartered
separately on purpose: the constants below are hard-pinned to one night, the lane
refuses to mint any other date, and there is deliberately no ``--asof`` flag.

WHY THIS ONE IS STRUCTURALLY DIFFERENT — AND WHAT THAT COSTS
------------------------------------------------------------
#5305 REPLAYED a receipted refusal: the 2026-08-09 bake ran, read a board that
survives in git, refused 30 candidates, and wrote an intake receipt.  The replay
flipped one poisoned input on that exact bake-time blob and re-ran the same intake.

For 2026-08-11 there is nothing to replay.  ``daily.yml`` was stranded by the #5362
workflow-size cap and its recovery dispatches were force-cancelled, so the night
produced NO collect, NO board, NO intake receipt, NO refusal set.  The board artifact
went straight from ``as_of=2026-08-10`` to ``as_of=2026-08-12``; an ``as_of=2026-08-11``
board has never existed anywhere in this repository's history.

So this lane RECONSTRUCTS rather than replays, and every honesty property has to be
built rather than inherited:

1. PRICE TRUNCATION IS STRUCTURAL, NOT A PATCH.  The reconstruction does not run in
   the live tree with date-clamped readers — a clamp is only as good as its coverage
   of a 6,378-line builder's every read.  Instead the board is built inside a pinned
   VINTAGE WORKTREE checked out at ``VINTAGE_COMMIT`` (main as of the wall-clock
   22:30Z bake), whose committed price store ends 2026-08-10 because the stranded
   collect never wrote 08-11.  This lane then overlays EXACTLY the sessions in
   ``(vintage_last, 2026-08-11]`` from the store as later collected.  A bar dated
   2026-08-12 is not clamped away at read time — it is never written to the tree at
   all, and ``fence_no_bar_after`` re-proves that over every price parquet before the
   builder is allowed to start.  Lookahead is excluded by construction, and the fence
   is what makes the claim checkable rather than asserted.
2. CODE VINTAGE IS PINNED, NOT ARGUED.  The wall-clock 22:30Z bake would have run main
   BEFORE #5370 merged (23:52:22Z, 82 minutes later).  Rather than rely on the review
   claim that #5370's two-surface ruling cannot move plan minting, the reconstruction
   simply runs the pre-#5370 tree: board build AND origination both execute inside the
   vintage worktree.  ``verify_code_vintage`` proves the tree is the pinned commit and
   that the commit predates #5370, and the disclosure records which path was taken.
3. THE HARNESS IS VALIDATED AGAINST A KNOWN-GOOD BOARD.  A reconstruction nobody has
   checked is a fabrication with good manners.  Run with ``--control`` the same harness
   truncates to 2026-08-10 instead and rebuilds the board the vintage commit ALREADY
   CARRIES (sha256 pinned below, 69 buy rows, ``as_of=2026-08-10``).  The measured
   agreement between that rebuild and the real artifact is the error bar on the
   2026-08-11 board, it is recorded in the disclosure, and a run below
   ``FIDELITY_FLOOR`` refuses unless the operator waives it explicitly.
4. THE WALL CLOCK IS NAMED WHERE IT CANNOT BE PINNED.  ``build_stock_library`` reads
   ``date.today()`` for the earnings-blackout gate, so a reconstruction executed on
   2026-08-13 sees earnings distances two sessions short.  ``TZ=UTC`` is forced (that
   is the timezone half of the #5289/#5304 defect — a +08:00 render host past local
   midnight reads tomorrow's earnings as already past, one-sided lookahead), and the
   residual date half is MEASURED: ``earnings_blackout_delta`` names every board row
   whose blackout verdict differs between the two dates instead of leaving the reader
   to wonder.

WHAT IT WRITES / NEVER WRITES (§3.4, unchanged from #5305).
  writes:  site/prophet/plans/<ID>.json           (surviving minted plans)
           data/prophet/origination_receipts/backfill-20260811-<hash>.json
           data/prophet/backfill_disclosures.json (APPENDS one row)
  NEVER:   data/prophet/ledger.jsonl              (nightly is the sole advancer)
           site/prophet/index.json, site/prophet/states/*   (nightly renders)
           site/factordata/*                      (not ours — and the reconstructed
                                                   board is deliberately NOT published)

GATES ARE UNTOUCHED (§0.8).  ``originate_plans``, ``_resolve_origination_clocks``,
``select_candidates`` and ``engine/prophet_integrity.py`` are imported and called,
never modified.  Everything this module adds happens strictly BEFORE (pinning,
truncating and validating the inputs) or strictly AFTER (stamping, collision-dropping,
chronology-refusing, disclosing).

Run (dry run — prints the would-mint set with per-name provenance, writes nothing):

    python3 -m scripts.backfill_prophet_outage_20260811 \\
        --vintage-worktree <path> --plans-baseline origin/main

``--control`` additionally rebuilds the 2026-08-10 board and reports harness fidelity.
``--execute`` writes the artifacts.  ``--verify-collisions`` re-derives the collision
set against fresh ``origin/main`` and exits nonzero on any NEW collision; run it
immediately before merge (§0.4 — the window closes at MERGE, not execution).

    ``measured`` comes back from the vintage subprocess.  It is computed THERE, and that

    which drags ``engine`` and ``lib`` into ``sys.modules`` bound to the vintage tree.
    An earlier draft imported it here, and the next ordinary import in this process —
    ``scripts.build_prophet``, from the PR checkout — then resolved ``engine.prophet_bridge``
    to the VINTAGE's copy and died on a symbol that did not exist yet. Every read of the
    vintage now happens in a subprocess; this process never puts that tree on its path.

    The #5289/#5304 timezone-lookahead defect is FIXED on the path that decides board
    membership, and this lane verified that rather than assuming it: the W1.5 blackout
    gate resolves its session through ``_eb_board_session_date``, which anchors to

    reconstruction rebuilds ``alpha.json`` at ``as_of=2026-08-11`` from the truncated
    panel, that anchor IS the reconstructed night — admission carries no host clock.

    What survives is smaller and display-tier, and it is named here instead of being
    quietly enjoyed: ``main()`` computes a days-to-next-earnings map from
    ``date.today()`` inside a closure this lane cannot reach from outside, and feeds it
