"""Select the delayed-chain snapshot files that are safe to commit after a red collect.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-06 postmortem — see collectors/cboe.py KNOWN_PERMANENT_GAPS)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`commit data` in daily.yml gates on ``steps.collectors.outcome == 'success'``, and that
gate is correct: the collectors step is the only producer of the bulk market plane, and
committing that tree behind a red/skipped producer is what caused the 2026-08-04 P0.

But two stores in that tree are not like the others. ``data/cboe/putcall.parquet`` and
``data/cboe/gex*.parquet`` are ONE-ROW-PER-SESSION SNAPSHOTS of a delayed-quotes chain
endpoint that serves only the LIVE book. Every other store re-fetches its history each
night, so a skipped commit costs those nothing — the next run refills them. These twelve
cannot be refilled by anything, ever. When the commit is skipped the row is still on
disk, and the next run's ``actions/checkout`` (clean by default) resets the tracked
parquet and destroys it.

That is not a hypothetical. 2026-08-03: gex + all ten symbols recovered on the
post-cooldown sweep (``cboe_gex -> ok (11 rows, last 2026-08-03)``), then `run
collectors` died on ``AttributeError: 'NYGamingAdapter' object has no attribute
'fetch_result_status'`` and every one of those rows was deleted the next evening.
2026-08-04: the whole family collected clean and was deleted the same way.

So this is scoped by the property that actually distinguishes them — unrecoverable and
producer-complete — not by "commit more of the tree when things are broken":

  * ONLY the declared chain family (collectors.cboe.CHAIN_FAMILY_SERIES). Not a glob
    over data/, not data/cboe/* — cor1m/skew/vvix/vix_futures re-fetch full history
    every night and must stay behind the collectors gate.
  * Each file must PARSE and its last row must be a real NYSE session. A collectors
    step that died mid-write leaves a torn parquet; a torn file is dropped, not staged.
  * No normalizer runs downstream of these files, which is what made the 08-04 P0
    possible for the page tree. The adapters write the final artifact directly.

Fail-open to an empty list: this runs on a night that is already red, and it must never
be the reason the job gets redder.
