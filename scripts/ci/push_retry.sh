#
# WHY (2026-07-25, render.yml run 30167139398): a scope=all render built every page
# CORRECTLY — 1121 locked special-situations rows, a fresh site/premiumdata — and then
# lost ALL FIVE push attempts to
#
#     ! [remote rejected] main -> main (cannot lock ref 'refs/heads/main':
#       is at <X> but expected <Y>)
#
# ~95 minutes of render discarded under a red X that reads like a conflict. It was not
# one. That rejection is a LOST RACE for the ref against the many lanes that commit to
# main every 1–2 minutes (agent branches, marketing-publish, research_vault catalog,
# immune journals, live quotes). The old loop had a 70-second total backoff window
# (sleep 7,14,21,28 across 5 attempts) and spent the CONFLICT remedy on it — a
# `git rebase --abort` plus a growing sleep — when all the race ever needed was one
# more re-sync-and-push. Capacity, not correctness.
#
# So this policy does two things the old loop could not:
#
#   1. It tells the two failure modes apart and spends the right remedy on each.
#      CONTENTION (ref-lock loss / non-fast-forward) retries FAST: the ref frees within
#      seconds and the whole job is to land in one of main's gaps. A real REBASE
#      CONFLICT backs off HARD, so main settles before the next replay — and it is
#      logged as a conflict, so a recurring one is visible as a NEW deterministic
#      conflict class rather than being buried in "lost a race".
#
#   2. It gives the loop a budget that matches main's actual commit rate: 10 attempts
#      inside a wall-clock deadline, with JITTERED sleeps. Jitter is load-bearing —
#      render.yml, engine-render.yml, closing-bell.yml and the nightly all retried on
#      the identical deterministic `sleep $((i * 7))` ladder, so two lanes that
#      collided once collided again on every single retry.
#
# The deadline is a HARD ceiling: no loop can outlive its job's timeout-minutes waiting
# for a ref. When it expires the caller's existing give-up path runs unchanged. Nothing
# here changes the caller's completion gate, `-X theirs` semantics, or
# scripts/rebase_autoresolve_hashed_css.sh. Render invokes this library only after its
# builders and guards complete, so an incomplete tree never enters the push loop.
#
# Tunables (plain shell assignments, set BEFORE push_retry_init — the library is
# SOURCED into the step's own shell, so no export is needed; each has a working
# default):
#   PUSH_MAX_ATTEMPTS  attempts before giving up          (default 10)
#   PUSH_BUDGET_SECS   wall-clock ceiling for the loop    (default 420)
#   PUSH_ALARM         seconds for a perl-alarm-bounded   (default unset = unbounded)
#                      `git push`, matching the lanes that already alarm-bound their
#                      git network ops on macOS runners (no GNU timeout there)
#
# Every function returns 0 unless it is a loop condition, so sourcing into GitHub's
# `bash -e` shell is safe.

# Publish-target containment (P0 2026-08-02).
#
# Every lane below ends its commit step with some form of
#
#     git pull --rebase --autostash origin main && ... && git push origin HEAD:main
#
# and every one of them also carries `workflow_dispatch`, which accepts ANY ref.
# So dispatching one of these lanes on a feature branch — a legitimate and
# useful way to read a lane's diagnostic output — REBASES that branch onto main
# and PUSHES IT TO MAIN: unreviewed commits land with no PR, no review and no
# CI, while the operator sees only a green audit run. Found 2026-08-02 on
# seo-director.yml while trying to dispatch it on claude/gsc-index-diagnostics
# for its GSC output; that dispatch was abandoned and the change went through a
# normal PR instead.
#
# The guard tests the CHECKED-OUT ref, never `github.ref`, because the two come
# apart in BOTH directions across this estate:
#
#   * government-revenue-live.yml pins `ref: main` at checkout, so its HEAD is
#     main on any trigger ref — a `github.ref` guard would block a legitimate
#     run;
#   * metabolism-{propose,adjudicate,build}.yml are DESIGNED to be dispatched
#     over a propose branch (metabolism/propose-<id>) and re-anchor with
#     `git checkout -B _journal_main origin/main` before pushing their journal
#     snapshot to main — a `github.ref` guard would block the entire reason
#     those steps exist.
#
# Those three declare PUSH_MAIN_BRANCHES=_journal_main, which buys a second
# assertion for free: that re-anchoring `checkout -B` is suffixed `|| true`, so
# before this guard a FAILED re-anchor silently left HEAD on the propose branch
# and pushed it to main. Naming the re-anchor branch as the only acceptable
# publish target makes that failure fail closed.
#
# Fail-closed: an unreadable HEAD, a detached HEAD, or any branch name outside
# the allow-list returns 1. Callers stand down FAIL-SOFT (`exit 0` / `return 1`)
# — a lane dispatched off main must still run and surface its output in the run
# log, which is what makes an off-main dispatch a useful thing to do. Only the
# push is withheld.

# Conflicted-autostash containment (P0 2026-08-01, engine commit d29e4dd44d,
# emergency heal #4167).
#
# `git pull --rebase --autostash` EXITS 0 when the rebase succeeds but the
# autostash re-apply conflicts: git leaves `<<<<<<< Updated upstream` /
# `>>>>>>> Stashed changes` blocks plus unmerged index entries in the tree,
# stores the autostash entry, prints a stderr warning — and the push loop's
# success branch keeps running. On 2026-08-01 the nightly's chronicle push did
# exactly that (its autostash parked the whole not-yet-committed night render;
# upstream had re-stamped 1,895 pages via #4151/#4155/#4158), and the next
# step's broad `git add data/ site/ reports/` swept 1,707 marker-polluted
# pages into main. Two containment layers for the render-family lanes:
#
#   push_autostash_ok  — call immediately after a "successful" pull, in the
#                        same `&&` condition. Detects the conflicted apply,
#                        discards the leftover dirt (callers pull only AFTER
#                        their outputs are committed, so tracked dirt at pull
#                        time is throwaway by lane contract), drops git's own
#                        `autostash` stash entry ONLY — the stash stack is
#                        repo-global, so a named/foreign entry is never
#                        touched — and returns 1 so the loop retries on a
#                        clean tree.
#   push_staged_clean  — fail-closed pre-commit gate: refuses the commit when
#                        the index carries unmerged entries or staged conflict
#                        markers. Offenders are exported for callers that heal.

#   * HEAD is guard-clean by induction (every writer to main passes this gate
#     or the full-tree ci.yml/pages.yml python scans);
#   * `--name-only` diffs compare OIDs — no blob content is read — and the
#     changed paths' bytes are then read from the WORKING TREE, never from
#     index objects. This matters on render.yml's blobless managed checkout,
#     where a `git grep --cached` over unchanged entries would hydrate ~594 MB
#     of promised blobs via the promisor — or silently scan nothing when the
#     promisor call fails. At every call site the gate runs immediately after
#     its `git add`, so worktree bytes ARE the staged bytes.
# Fail-closed: if the changed-path enumeration itself fails, the gate refuses.
# Lone `=======` lines are deliberately out of scope (setext underlines); a
# stash/rebase conflict always writes the `<<<<<<< ` / `>>>>>>> ` lines this
# scans for, and the committed-tree python scans keep the full grammar.
