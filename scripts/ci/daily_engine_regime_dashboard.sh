# that stood here is DEAD: the two bake-side blockers it named were FIXED in
# #3578, not accepted as risks. (1) pick_lab's _load_radar_json
# (engine/pick_lab/candidates.py) gates radar.json on as_of ==
# data/yahoo/SPY.parquet's data-through — the same anchor this builder derives
# as_of from — so a stale express artifact resolves to [] and express-computed
# fires can never advance the forward pick ledger. (2) Off-nightly,
# built_at/elapsed_s are carried from the committed artifact when the payload is
# otherwise byte-identical, so an untouched rebake commits nothing and the
# dead-man reading of built_at stays honest. (#3578 also added the rs_series lag
# disclosure + the PIT state/fire view caps that make a rebake reproduce the
# nightly bake.) data/ writes stay COLLECT_LANE=nightly-gated (HOUSE-U5) and the
# express lanes commit site/ ONLY, so this nightly remains the sole advancer of
# the radar's forward stores.
# LIVE-VERIFICATION: the 22:30 UTC nightly is NOT the only path to a fresh
# site/leaderradar/radar.json. render.yml's region_of maps both
# scripts/build_leader_radar.py (via scripts/build_*.py) and
# templates/leader_radar.html.j2 (via templates/*) to `all`, and one `all`-mapped
# dirty file forces scope=all — so a leader-radar change always carries its own
# express rebake. engine-render.yml has no scope picker: an engine/** push (e.g.
# engine/leader_lifecycle.py) runs with the default scope=all, which calls
# leaderradar too. Narrow scopes do NOT call it — an unrelated
