"""Refuse to publish an append-only artifact computed over a base that has moved.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-18, DSC-OVERLAPPING-DAILY-COLLECT-JOBS-LOSE-APPEND-ONLY-ROWS)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every lane here publishes with ``git pull --rebase --autostash -X theirs origin main``.
That strategy is right for the bulk market plane -- a freshly collected store should beat
a stale one on any conflicting hunk -- and it is CATASTROPHIC for an append-only ledger,
because "prefer ours" on a file both sides appended to REPLACES the other side's rows
instead of unioning them.

Measured twice on ``data/government_revenue/``:

  * 2026-08-07  1fc6d1181e4c -> 08ad4d836d6a  ``collection_receipts.jsonl`` 720 -> 720
    lines with 360 receipt ids dropped and 360 substituted -- the two halves swapped
    wholesale, same byte count, no growth.
  * 2026-08-18  59ccb9c774c8 -> 93ab221b81dd  the EDT cron run's collect job
    (01:07:12Z->04:08:26Z, committed 04:01:49Z) and a workflow_dispatch run's collect job
    (01:27:00Z->04:28:57Z, committed 04:21:53Z) overlapped. Run B had checked out ~2.5h
    before run A's commit existed. Its push dropped 376 receipts and re-stamped run A's
    16 newly appended ``award_event_snapshots.parquet`` rows -- identical
    ``event_state_sha256``, run B's ``known_at`` -- which moved ``_event_id``, therefore
    ``candidate_id``, therefore orphaned a 26-row ``candidate_ledger.jsonl`` issuance
    batch and redded ci-pack-6 through ci-gate for every armed PR in the fleet.

The overlap is BY DESIGN and must not be "fixed" by merging concurrency groups:
``.github/workflows/daily.yml`` gives each DST cron and each manual dispatch its own
group precisely so the DST pair cannot cancel each other's slot (the 2026-08-14/15 kill).
The fix belongs at the artifact layer.

WHY THE EXISTING WRITE-PATH GUARDS CANNOT SEE THIS
---------------------------------------------------
``collectors/usaspending_awards.py`` is careful and all of it is scoped to one process's
disk: the torn-generation refusal (:3956-3972) compares the on-disk state binding to the
on-disk ledgers, and the staged-replay check (:4030-4044) proves the bytes a reader will
load reproduce the generation this run computed. A run whose entire base is stale is
PERFECTLY SELF-CONSISTENT and passes both. Nothing asked whether ``origin/main`` moved
under the artifact between checkout and push. This does.

WHAT IT CHECKS
--------------
For each family in ``config/append_only_artifacts.json``, and only for members THIS run's
local commits actually changed (``<onto>..HEAD``):

  * ``jsonl_prefix`` -- ``origin/main``'s bytes must be a prefix of the bytes about to be
    pushed. This is the contract the repo already asserts for ``collection_receipts.jsonl``
    (tests/test_usaspending_awards.py) and enforces byte-exactly for
    ``candidate_ledger.jsonl`` via its ``prior_sha256`` state receipt.
  * ``parquet_rows`` -- every identity tuple on ``origin/main`` must still be present.
    Order-independent: parquet re-encodes, so a positional prefix is not a contract the
    writers promise, while "no published row disappears" is.

Scoping to CHANGED members is load-bearing, not an optimization. A member this run did
not touch cannot be clobbered by the rebase -- ``-X theirs`` only resolves conflicting
hunks -- and flagging it would fire on every ordinary night, because the 30-minute
``government-revenue-live`` lane appends ``candidate_ledger.jsonl`` rows while the
nightly collect job is still running.

WHAT IT DOES ON A VIOLATION
---------------------------
It WITHHOLDS the family: every path in ``withhold_paths`` is restored from ``origin/main``
and committed, so the rebase has nothing to resolve and main's coherent generation
survives. The run's own rows are dropped, deliberately -- the collector re-fetches an
1826-day window every night, so a withheld generation costs one cycle, while a published
lost-update costs evidence permanently and is not repairable by a session.

The withhold is the WHOLE family, never one file: reverting individual artifacts leaves
the generation entangled (measured -- reverting ``award_event_snapshots.parquet`` alone,
then + the projection state, then + the receipts, then all 25 changed artifacts, each
rebuilt to a different broken shape).

FAILURE DIRECTIONS, ON PURPOSE
------------------------------
  * A member we changed that cannot be READ or whose identity columns are absent is
    ``indeterminate`` and withholds. We changed a file we cannot prove extends main.
  * An INFRASTRUCTURE fault -- ``git rev-list`` failing, so the changed-set is unknown --
    does NOT withhold. Without the changed-set a withhold could destroy a legitimate
    generation, and declining to act merely leaves the pre-fence behaviour in place. It
    prints ``::error`` and exits 0, so the fault is visible in the run summary.
  * A withhold that itself FAILS exits ``WITHHOLD_FAILED`` (2), and the shell helper turns
    that into a non-zero return so the caller skips the push for that iteration. This is
    the one place the fence must not fail open: the whole point of the withhold is that
    this tree is not publishable, and "the remedy broke" is not a reason to publish it.
  * Every other exit is 0, so the fence never fails the step. The market plane must
    publish; the annotation is the signal. (``--check-only`` returns 1 on a violation.)

The fence does NOT inherit the 2026-08-18 corruption. It compares this run's build against
``origin/main``; it never walks history. (For the record, PR #5870 restored run A's
generation, so ``origin/main``'s ``collection_receipts.jsonl`` is byte-identical to
59ccb9c774c8 again -- but nothing here depends on that.)
