# TOP ANATOMY R0b ordering fix (TOPA-COMPLETION-20260828): build_top_maturation in
# cl_stage consumes data/massive_stock_day, which is R2-canonical and gitignored —
# a fresh engine checkout never holds the shards, and this job's only other restore
# of that store (the price_pressure lobe leg) runs AFTER this band. Cold runner
# proof: run 33232322255 / job 99066153702 — "panel: 0 source files" at 12:10:46Z,
# then the SAME job restored 21,452 tickers at 12:56Z; Winner Health fail-opened to
# a null artifact stamped with a healthy vintage (the manifest is committed, the
# shards are not) at rc=0, four consecutive nights. So: restore BEFORE any cluster
# launches. Same guarded idiom as the price_pressure leg — warm runner = one
# find(1) probe that stops at the first hit (never a glob: ~20k files ≈ 800KB of
# argv), cold runner = the same delta download the later leg would otherwise pay,
# so net job cost is unchanged. Non-fatal on purpose: the builder's own staleness
# gate refuses and writes its designed null rather than failing the band, and the
# later price_pressure leg retries. R2_* env comes from the step's env block.
# Ordering pinned by tests/test_daily_engine_massive_restore_order.py.
