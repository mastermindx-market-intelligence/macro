"""Static guard: no git conflict markers in templates, shipped site files, or code.

2026-07-03 incident: a merge commit shipped literal conflict markers
(`<<<<<<< ours` / `=======` / `>>>>>>> theirs`) inside templates/dashboard.html.j2
and NOTHING went red. Jinja parses marker lines as plain text (a syntactically
valid template), the pytest suite never rendered that block, and the existing
guards (check_inline_js, check_title_i18n, check_nav_*) don't look for markers —
so the broken merge landed green and the markers rendered on the live page.
This guard turns that whole class of accident into a pre-merge / pre-deploy
failure, in the same ci.yml / pages.yml gates as its siblings.

What it flags (column-0 anchored, like git writes them):
  `<<<<<<< <label>`  — always flagged
  `>>>>>>> <label>`  — always flagged (a lone one = partially cleaned conflict)
  `=======`          — flagged ONLY between a `<<<<<<<` and a `>>>>>>>` line in
                       the same file: a bare 7-equals line is a legitimate
                       setext/RST heading underline in docs, so out-of-block
                       occurrences are ignored. diff3-style `||||||| <base>`
                       lines are flagged under the same in-block rule.

Scope: templates/**, engine/**, scripts/** (every text file), and site/**
restricted to *.html / *.json / *.js / *.css — the bytes that actually ship.
Binary files (NUL in the first 1 KiB) are skipped.

Usage:
    python -m scripts.check_conflict_markers [ROOT]   # default: repo root (.)
    python -m scripts.check_conflict_markers --file PATH
    python -m scripts.check_conflict_markers --changed-from REV [ROOT]
    python -m scripts.check_conflict_markers --self-test

When ci-plan published a changed-file list, ``--changed-from`` scans that list
and does not git-diff. Packs checkout fetch-depth:1 after #5564, so
``origin/main...HEAD`` is often a bad revision; fail-closed only if no list was
published (then git) or the published one is malformed.

Two names carry the list, FILE first (2026-08-14, run 31775693780):
``CI_CHANGED_FILES_FILE`` holds a path to it, ``CI_CHANGED_FILES_JSON`` holds it
inline. The file exists because the inline form measured 350,264 bytes on
PR #5578 — past execve's 131,072-byte MAX_ARG_STRLEN — and every pack died at
launch with "Argument list too long". A configured-but-unreadable or empty file
is MALFORMED (fail-closed), never "unset": a transport that lost its payload
must not silently license the git fallback.
Exit codes: 0 = clean / self-test passed · 1 = marker(s) found / self-test failed.
