"""R4 contract drift checker (NW Rails PR-7).

Compares each entry in site/factordata/contracts/artifact_manifest.json against the
live artifact on disk.  Exits nonzero when the artifact's actual top-level JSON fields
diverge from the manifest's schema_fields contract.

The "34-field china_standouts consumed by a real-money bot with no handshake" hazard:
a field added or removed silently in the nightly build is invisible to consumers until
they crash on a KeyError at trade time.  This guard makes schema drift visible at PR
merge time.

Wildcard artifacts (kind=per_stock_intel, per_stock_signal): sampled from the first
file in the glob directory.  If no live sample exists the entry is SKIPPED (no data
in this environment is not a drift).

Optional (conditional) fields: a manifest entry may carry an `optional_fields` list
for top-level keys the builder emits only when a data condition holds (e.g.
canada_standouts.sector_concentration fires only when >60% of the board clusters in
one sector).  Such a field is present some nights and absent others by design — it is
excluded from BOTH the added- and removed-drift diffs so it never flaps the lane
red↔green with the data.  A genuinely undocumented new key (in neither schema_fields
nor optional_fields) still trips `added`, preserving the silent-field-added guard.

Usage:
    python scripts/check_contract_drift.py            # hard-fail mode (default)
    python scripts/check_contract_drift.py --warn-only  # exit 0 even on drift

Ratchet: flip to hard-fail after one clean week: 2026-07-13
(Remove --warn-only from the ci.yml step and delete this comment once the date passes.)
