"""Lane 6 — emit the biopharma seasonality shadow lobe + advance its forward ledger.

Reads the committed calendar-clock artifacts (``site/seasonalitydata/``), builds
one compact, expiring, context-only Neural Web state per covered biopharma
symbol via the fail-closed contract, and writes:

* ``data/neuralweb/biopharma_seasonality_state.json`` — the envelope-stamped
  state map plus the structured gaps for everything it could not build;
* ``data/seasonality/nw_forward_ledger.jsonl`` — APPEND-ONLY forward outcomes,
  one register row per (symbol, window occurrence) for every forecast the map
  shows, graded at horizon from the adjusted-close store.

Four things worth knowing before editing this file:

* **Nothing here can act.**  Every state carries the birth authority ceiling
  (all-false) from ``engine.seasonality.contracts``; the consumer attaches the
  block only to names an existing candidate universe already admitted.  There
  is no rank, gate, size, or origination path in or out of this artifact.
* **This script is the ledger's SOLE advancer.**  House law: the nightly
  advances forward ledgers and intraday lanes discard ``data/`` writes.  The
  ledger is opened in append mode and existing lines are never rewritten,
  reordered, or re-dated — a re-run appends nothing it has already recorded.
* **Fail-open, always.**  A missing index, a missing entity artifact, an absent
  price store: each becomes a structured gap or an annotation, never an
  exception.  ``main`` returns 0 unconditionally — a shadow lobe must not take
  the nightly down.
* **It must run AFTER build_stock_seasonality.**  The entity tree it reads is
  gitignored except the default symbol, so off the runner it is only populated
  by that builder earlier in the same sequential cluster.

Roughly a second of work: ~28 symbols, one 305-start baseline sweep each.
