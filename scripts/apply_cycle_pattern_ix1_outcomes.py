"""Apply the FROZEN §17 outcome handling after the IX-1 run (results wave).

Everything this script writes was pre-committed in PREREGISTRATION.md §17 "Outcome handling
(frozen)" — it makes no judgments, it executes them. The run produced 0 PASS / 4 (the 0/4
null branch FIRED), so per the frozen handling:

  1. Truths (engine.cycle_pattern.truths): ONE scoped null truth
     `cycle_truth_ix1_index_transfer_null_v1` — "the member-trained hazard does not
     transfer to index level against index age-pooled KM" — with the down cells' passing
     CI/BH legs and the year-concentration named inside the statement (honest scope: the
     null is about the frozen conjunction, i.e. reliability, not the pooled point
     estimate), and the §17 falsifiers (stacking trial / post-embargo accrual) as the
     reopening conditions.
  2. NO factory candidates (frozen: candidates are written only on PASS).
  3. No page/UI change; the markets.html US-row engine-backing wave is moot on 0/4.
     Exploration tables (full pre-embargo index KM + per-entity ΔBrier decomposition)
     ship inside the artifact.

Idempotent: every write is guarded by an existence check, so re-runs are no-ops.
