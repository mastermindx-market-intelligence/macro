"""One-off force-majeure replay of the receipted 2026-08-09 origination refusal.

DESIGN OF RECORD: ``research/PROPHET_OUTAGE_BACKFILL_2026_08.md`` (§0 acceptance
gates, §3 mechanism).  Operator order 2026-08-11 ~00:05Z, a force-majeure override
of the forward-ledger no-backfill law, scoped to EXACTLY ONE origination event.

WHAT THIS REPLAYS.  The 2026-08-09 22:59Z Sunday bake ran the current intake end to
end and refused all 30 eligible candidates at ``clock_provenance`` because the board
it read carried ``staleness.inputs.panel.mixed_vintage=true``.  Six of 1,758 panel
members held Sunday-dated bars, so the pre-#5241 reach summary called a board that
was not torn "mixed vintage".  #5241 added the NYSE session clamp; the same board,
re-measured, is not mixed.  The counterfactual flips exactly that one field.

THE INPUT IS THE BAKE-TIME BOARD, NOT A LATER RE-RENDER (§0.2, review 2026-08-11).
Post-heal re-renders of the same ``as_of`` are FORBIDDEN as replay input: the
2026-08-10 evening re-render swapped the ranker (``us_prophet_v1`` -> ``v2``),
refreshed its options snapshot, and admitted ASTS/CRC/SVM through a wall-clock hole
in the earnings-blackout gate (a +08:00 render host past local midnight read their
2026-08-10 earnings as already past — one-sided lookahead).  Board membership
measurably flapped 78<->81 rows by render-host timezone on an identical ``as_of``.
The bake-time blob is pinned by sha256 below and every one of those properties is a
hard refusal.  The wall-clock defect itself is a SEPARATE fix lane — this script does
not touch ``build_stock_library``.

WHAT IT WRITES / NEVER WRITES (§3.4).
  writes:  site/prophet/plans/<ID>.json           (surviving minted plans)
           data/prophet/origination_receipts/<id>.json
           data/prophet/backfill_disclosures.json
  NEVER:   data/prophet/ledger.jsonl              (nightly is the sole advancer)
           site/prophet/index.json, site/prophet/states/*   (nightly renders)
           site/factordata/*                      (not ours)

GATES ARE UNTOUCHED (§0.8).  ``originate_plans``, ``_resolve_origination_clocks``,
``select_candidates`` and ``engine/prophet_integrity.py`` are imported and called,
never modified.  Everything this module adds happens strictly BEFORE (pinning and
verifying the inputs) or strictly AFTER (stamping, collision-dropping, disclosing).

HOST DEPENDENCE IS DETECTED, NOT ASSUMED.  The board and plan baseline come out of
git and are host-independent.  The geometry inputs are not: ``_bear_from_regime`` and
``_stage_tilt_demoted`` read ``data/`` through ``lib.config.data_dir()``, which takes
no override, so ``originate_plans`` reads whatever tree it runs in.  Rather than
assume that matches the bake, this script evaluates each of those inputs at BOTH the
pinned bake-time vintage and the live tree and REFUSES to mint when they diverge
(§0.2 PIT geometry).  Whatever cannot be pinned at all is named, per field, with the
vintage actually used, in the disclosure artifact.

Run (dry run — prints the would-mint set, writes nothing):

    python3 -m scripts.backfill_prophet_outage \\
        --board-commit <sha> --plans-baseline <sha>

Add ``--execute`` to write the artifacts.  ``--verify-collisions`` re-derives the
collision set against fresh ``origin/main`` and exits nonzero on any NEW collision;
run it immediately before merge (§0.4 — the window closes at MERGE, not execution).

    SHAPE IS LOAD-BEARING, not cosmetic.  ``scripts/audit_prophet_plan_chronology.py``
    validates EVERY receipt present in a plan's creation commit before it will audit
    that plan, so a receipt that merely looks similar would break chronology audits
    for every plan created from this commit forward.  The contract it enforces:
    schema/receipt_id/filename agreement; a ``source`` block whose ``source_asof``
    equals ``price_through`` and whose mirrored staleness fields agree; sorted-unique
    ``originated_plan_ids`` in the same order as ``originations``; and per row a
    ``board_row_sha256`` over the canonical JSON of the frozen board row.

    ``source.staleness`` is the HEALED block — the one origination actually read —
    so the receipt describes the run that happened rather than a run that did not.
    What was healed, and how the heal was verified, rides in ``backfill.heal`` where
    an auditor can find it instead of having to infer it.

    ``run`` is written HONESTLY (m12): this was not an Actions run, and the block
    says so — the script is the actor, the branch is the real ref, and
    ``is_backfill`` is explicit.  The auditor reads none of those fields, so honesty
    here costs nothing and a misleading ``run`` block would cost an auditor's trust.
