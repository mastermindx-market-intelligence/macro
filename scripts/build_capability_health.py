"""scripts/build_capability_health.py — F13 V1 adapter for engine.capability_health.

THE ADAPTER, NOT THE CONTRACT. Every rule about what a capability's state MEANS lives in
the pure resolver :mod:`engine.capability_health`; this file only goes and looks, exactly
the way ``scripts/build_output_health.py`` relates to ``engine/output_health.py``.

RECEIPT SOURCES, PER TYPE
--------------------------
``output_health_artifact``
    Composed READ-ONLY off :func:`scripts.build_output_health.build` — the same public
    entry point ``admin/intelligence_os.py`` calls. Neither ``engine/output_health.py``
    nor ``scripts/build_output_health.py`` is edited by F13; this module only imports and
    reads their already-resolved view. The already-judged ``state``/``assessment_status``
    ride through verbatim (an ``output_health_artifact`` fact is an upstream VERDICT, not
    raw clocks — see the engine module's docstring on why that fold never re-derives it).
    ``corrupt``/``rights_blocked`` are correctly always ``False`` for this source type:
    output_health has no distinct "corrupt receipt" or "rights block" signal of its own
    (blindness is already fully expressed via ``state=None, assessment_status=
    could_not_look``), so there is nothing further to wire here.
``nightly_lane``
    Read from ``data/run_status.json``: a named key under ``sources`` (per-source
    ``status``/``checked_at``/``last_date``), or the literal ``__global__`` for the
    top-level ``last_run`` heartbeat. The collector status vocabulary
    (``collectors/base.py``'s ``FetchResult.status``: ok | stale | failed | dead |
    skipped | blocked) is mapped explicitly (repair 2026-09-04, findings C1/I5):
      ok      -> last_attempted = last_successful = checked_at (a genuine success) —
                 UNLESS a ``stale_series`` row also names this ref's group (see the
                 ROUND-5 paragraph below): a genuinely frozen series then forces the
                 SAME explicit ``state=stale`` override the ``stale`` status gets one
                 bullet down, on top of the ok/fresh attempt+success clocks.
      stale   -> an EXPLICIT ``state=stale`` (the collector's own declared staleness
                 call, not a re-derivation from our own stale_after_hours budget)
      failed/dead -> last_attempted = checked_at ONLY. data/run_status.json retains only
                 the LATEST row per source (no history), so there is no prior
                 last_successful to compare against — the honest fact is "attempted, no
                 prior success known", which the engine resolves to could_not_look, never
                 a fabricated degraded/stale guess.
      blocked -> ``rights_blocked=True`` (a known, expected limitation — bot-blocked,
                 paywalled — never conflated with a failure)
      skipped -> "no-attempt-fact": neither clock is supplied at all (the source was not
                 even consulted this run; the engine reads that as no_clock_evidence, not
                 a failure)
    ``__global__`` NEVER supplies ``last_successful`` — ``scripts/collect.py`` writes
    ``last_run`` unconditionally once the collect pass reaches that line, regardless of
    per-source outcome, so it can only ever prove an attempt, never a verified success.
    (No capability in the V1 seed cohort actually declares a ``__global__`` source any
    more — see ``config/capability_health.yml``'s comment on why one was removed from
    ``prophet_us`` in this same repair: a source that can NEVER contribute anything but
    could_not_look would permanently poison its capability under the worst-fold law.)

    ROUND-3 REPAIR (2026-09-06 independent review): ``last_date`` is NEVER mapped onto
    ``data_as_of`` here, in ANY status branch. ``last_date`` is
    ``collectors/base.py``'s group-MAX OBSERVATION date across a source's own stored
    series — not an as-of instant — and a healthy, live shape (fred's FEDTARMD FOMC
    projection series legitimately carries a `last_date` years in the future) was being
    branded corrupt (``clock_value_future_dated``) by the round-2 repair for exactly this
    reason: it published a real, honest lane's receipt as ``could_not_look`` forever. A
    ``nightly_lane`` receipt truthfully carries only last_attempted/last_successful (+ an
    explicit stale ``state``, ``rights_blocked``, or ``blind_reason``) — it never had
    as-of semantics, and ``config/capability_health.yml``'s ``nightly_lane`` declarations
    no longer claim ``data_as_of`` either. A capability that needs a real as-of instant
    declares an ``output_health_artifact`` source instead (``resolve_output_health``'s
    already-judged ``source_asof`` genuinely IS bound to a point-in-time read).

    ROUND-4 REVIEW FINDING, CORRECTED BY ROUND-5: the round-3 fix above stopped a real
    false-corrupt bug but, taken alone, left the nightly-lane DATA axis with NOTHING to
    say when a series is genuinely frozen. This docstring previously implied the
    group-max ``status`` mapping above was the complete data-freshness signal for this
    source type — that claim was FALSE for exactly the poisoned-group case round-3
    protects: ``age = today - group_max_last`` can never exceed a cadence budget for a
    group whose max is a forward-dated projection series (fred's FEDTARMD FOMC-dot-plot
    shape), so ``status`` can never read anything but "ok" for that GROUP even when one
    of its OTHER series (e.g. CPIAUCSL) has gone stale for months.

    ROUND-5 REPAIR (this repair, item 1): the honest per-series receipt already exists
    and is immune to the group-max poisoning. ``collectors/base.py``'s
    ``detect_stale_series``/``_write_stale_series`` write named rows to
    ``run_status.json``'s TOP-LEVEL ``stale_series`` array — explicitly "for the health
    surface" per that module's own docstring — one row per ``(group, series)`` pair:
    ``{group, series, last_obs, cadence_days, age_days, detected_at}``, each comparing
    ONE series' own last observation against ITS OWN cadence budget, never the group
    max. :func:`nightly_lane_facts` now joins a ref's matching ``stale_series`` rows by
    EXACT ``group == ref`` string match (fred's rows carry ``group: "fred"``, identical
    to the ``fred`` nightly_lane ref) and, for a ``status`` in {ok, stale}, forces an
    explicit ``state=stale`` fact carrying a ``state_detail`` evidence string naming the
    frozen series/last_obs/age_days (capped and reason-join-scrubbed by
    ``engine.capability_health``'s ``_cap_foreign_text`` boundary — the same one round-3
    item 4 already applies to ``blind_reason``/``rights_detail``). The ABSENCE of a
    matching ``stale_series`` row, combined with ``status=ok``, is what actually
    composes to "healthy" here: the OWNING collector's own staleness detector found
    nothing wrong on EITHER axis it knows how to check (group-max attempt/success via
    ``status``, AND per-series frozen-tail via ``stale_series``) — never a silent
    omission of the data-freshness check. A malformed ``stale_series`` row (not a dict,
    or missing/non-string ``group``) is skipped fail-safe and can never by itself brand
    a source corrupt; a row that DOES match the group but carries unparseable
    ``series``/``age_days``/``last_obs`` fields still forces the stale state — the JOIN
    (the group match) is what matters, and a row with messy detail fields must never
    silently read as though it had never matched at all.

    ROUND-6 REPAIR (this repair, MAJOR-1, independent review): round-5's join above had
    no recovery path. ``_write_stale_series`` merges by ``(group, series)`` and never
    PRUNES an entry — ``detect_stale_series`` only ever returns still-frozen rows, so a
    series that recovers simply stops being written, and its stale row (with its now-
    stale ``detected_at``) sits in ``run_status.json`` unpruned. Measured consequence:
    one frozen-tail detection in group ``fred`` would previously force
    ``market_reference`` to ``stale`` on every subsequent run FOREVER, even once the
    series recovers and every run reads ``status=ok`` with a fresh success clock — the
    "absence of a matching row IS healthy" composition law two paragraphs up was true
    only for a group that had never yet tripped the detector. :func:`nightly_lane_facts`
    now accepts an optional ``now`` and, when supplied (as :func:`gather_receipts` always
    does), discounts a matching row via :func:`_stale_series_is_fresh` before joining it:
    a row whose ``detected_at`` has not been refreshed within
    ``_STALE_SERIES_RECENCY_HOURS`` no longer forces stale, because on this nightly
    cadence a STILL-frozen series would have been re-detected (and its ``detected_at``
    refreshed) again by now. The direction stays fail-closed: an ambiguous (missing or
    unparseable) ``detected_at`` is still treated as fresh, so only a row that positively
    demonstrates its own staleness is ever discounted.
``provider_rung`` / ``sentinel_probe``
    Declared in the closed receipt-source vocabulary and accepted by registry
    validation, but NOT wired to a live fetch in this V1 build: none of the seed cohort's
    five capabilities declares one (see ``config/capability_health.yml``'s header
    comment for the two commission candidates dropped for lack of a verifiable receipt).
    Additive later, per the frozen commission's "5-8 entries is right; additive later".

FAILS CLOSED ON A BAD REGISTRY (repair finding C3). A malformed/missing/non-dict
``config/capability_health.yml``, a missing or empty ``capabilities`` key, a duplicate
capability id, or an unresolvable ``depends_on`` reference is a HARD BUILD ERROR
(:class:`RegistryError`): :func:`main` prints every problem via a bare
``::warning``/``::error`` (never a logger), exits non-zero, and WRITES NOTHING — a
silent zero-capability artifact would destroy whatever last-good state a prior run wrote.

WRITES ONE ARTIFACT. Deterministic, no network, no GH API. Default output path is
``data/capability_health/state.json`` under ``--root`` — the production nightly default.
``--out`` and ``--receipts-root`` exist so a sparse worktree or a test can point both the
destination and the receipt reads somewhere that is never ``data/`` or ``site/``; the
default ``data/`` path is refused outright in a sparse worktree unless ``--out`` is given
explicitly (repair finding M5) — a write into an omitted tree can truncate the committed
artifact once the branch merges.

    ``blind_reason``) — never a ``data_as_of`` key.

    ROUND-5 repair (item 1, see the module docstring's ROUND-5 paragraph for the full
    rationale): a ``status`` of ``ok``/``stale`` also gets joined against
    ``run_status.json``'s top-level ``stale_series`` array by exact ``group == ref``
    match. A match forces ``state=stale`` (already implied for ``status=stale``; new
    for ``status=ok``) plus a ``state_detail`` evidence string — this is the fact-level
    mechanism that lets a genuinely frozen series in an otherwise "ok" group be
    reported, since the group-max ``status`` alone can never see it.
