"""BC-2 — the 'validated' grep gate (PREREGISTRATION.md §4, D2 §4.3).

DOCTRINE (measurement.html): every number the platform shows must trace to a stored,
leak-free, pre-registered artifact — or it does not ship with the word 'validated'.
This gate makes that mechanically true. It scans the user-facing surfaces
(templates/, site/*.js, generated *_data.js, and the engine/ display-copy fields that
FEED them) in BOTH English and Chinese ('validated', '已验证', '经验证', '经过验证' —
'已经验证' is covered through its '经验证' substring) and fails if an AFFIRMATIVE
'validated' claim maps to NO backing:

  A claim is BACKED iff either
    (a) it matches a justified entry in data/regime/validated_claims_allowlist.json
        (each entry names the evidence artifact / study it rests on) AND the claiming
        file's surface is named in that entry's `surfaces` list (_surfaces_of maps
        file -> surface; a phrase justified for one page never licenses another), or
    (b) the line references an artifact JSON whose top-level `validated == true`.

NEGATED / HEDGED uses are NOT claims and are ignored automatically:
  'no validated ...', 'not a validated ...', 'unvalidated', 'not ... validated',
  'un-validated', "hasn't/doesn't/won't/… (any n't contraction) ... validated",
  'cannot ... validated', '无...验证', '非...验证', '未...验证', '未经验证', '不...已验证'.
These are honest disclaimers ("HK has no validated selection edge") and must never be
forced to cite an artifact.

The gate is phrase-scoped, not file:line-scoped, so it survives page regeneration (the
per-basket/per-stock pages repeat one template phrase; one allowlist entry covers them all).
Rendered site HTML is autoescaped ('&' -> '&amp;', quotes -> '&#39;'/'&#34;'), so token,
negation, and allowlist matching all run on the html.unescape()d text of each line; the
raw line is kept for error reporting.
Its real power: a NEW affirmative 'validated' claim that matches no allowlisted justification
FAILS the build — which is exactly the discipline BC-2 buys.

QUOTED THIRD-PARTY RESEARCH is a STRUCTURAL non-claim (see _THIRD_PARTY_PAGES). The
research vault mirrors syndicated institutional notes verbatim on the nightly render
path, and 'validated' is ordinary English in economics prose ("the June CPI print
validated two likely sources of ongoing disinflation"). BC-2 governs what THE PLATFORM
asserts; reported speech from a named external author asserts nothing about a Macro
Dashboard signal, rank, gate, or artifact, so its stored-artifact requirement has
nothing to attach to. Those spans are skipped by construction rather than allowlisted
one quote at a time — see the module comment above _THIRD_PARTY_PAGES for the safety
invariant that keeps this from weakening the gate.

ENGINE SOURCE COPY is scanned too — see _COPY_BARE / scan_python_copy below. A claim
authored in engine/ used to be gated only once a nightly render carried it onto a page,
which is a day late and on somebody else's PR (#3765 → #3790).

PUBLISHED REGISTRY DATA is scanned on the same principle — see DATA_COPY_SPECS /
scan_json_copy. A claim authored in a data/ registry ROW reaches users through the
builder that copies it into a site payload, so it is gated at the row rather than a
nightly later on the generated half (found 2026-08-11 alongside #5413).

Run:  python -m scripts.check_validated_claims          # scan; exit 1 on any unearned claim
      python -m scripts.check_validated_claims --list    # list every affirmative claim + status
      python -m scripts.check_validated_claims --selftest # prove the gate fires on a synthetic EN+zh

# ── PUBLISHED REGISTRY DATA (DATA_COPY_SPECS) ────────────────────────────────────────
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Same bargain as PY_COPY_GLOBS, one layer further back. A claim
# authored in a research-registry ROW was gated only AFTER a nightly render carried it
# onto a page — a day late, on somebody else's PR — because SCAN_GLOBS covered no data/
# file at all. Found live 2026-08-11 while fixing the BC-2 landing breach (#5413): that
# change had to reword one claim TWICE, in data/cycle_pattern/truths.jsonl AND in the
# generated site/measurementdata/measurement_data.js, because only the generated half was
# gated. scripts/build_measurement.py publishes the registry's `statement` / `ci_summary`
# / `notes` verbatim into the null_library payload, so the row IS the copy.
#
# WHY FIELD-RESTRICTED, NOT WHOLE-FILE (the PY_COPY_GLOBS argument, re-derived). The
# estate tracks 22k data/*.json(l) files; a registry row carries far more bookkeeping
# than it publishes — falsifiers, stop rules, human-review questions, evidence refs. BC-2
# targets DISPLAYED CLAIMS, so each entry names the fields its builder actually copies
# out. `fields=None` means the builder publishes the record whole.
#
# WHY THE SURFACE COMES FROM THE PAYLOAD, NOT THE REGISTRY PATH. A claim's surface is the
# page a reader sees it on. Deriving it from `payload` (rather than from the .jsonl's own
# basename) means an allowlist entry that already earns the phrase on the rendered page
# earns it at the source too — the gate moves EARLIER without inventing a second,
# duplicate justification for the same sentence. It also fails honestly the other way: a
# phrase justified for some other page still does not license the registry row.
#
# WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* HERE (censused 2026-08-11; 20 registries publish token-
# bearing prose into site/, only these four are gateable AT THE ROW):
#   • MACHINE-EMITTED artifacts — data/regime/latest.json, regime/ai_desk.json,
#     neuralweb/*, altdata/mastermind.json, master_brain/track_record.json,
#     strategies/thematic_rotation_phase0*.json, vector/alerts.jsonl. A builder rewrites
#     these nightly, so the row is not the source of record: the sentence is a literal in
#     engine/, which PY_COPY_GLOBS already gates. Gating the artifact would red main on a
#     regeneration nobody can fix at the file.
#   • data/us_board_ledger/snapshots.jsonl — user-facing (its `cautions` reach the landing
#     island through derive_showcase_card) but an APPEND-ONLY ledger of fossilised board
#     snapshots: 510 historical rows carry the phrase and cannot be rewritten. #5413 put
#     the gate in the right place for it — the emitter sanitizes at one choke point.
#   • data/experiments/registry_seed.json, species/registry.json,
#     neuralweb/evidence_clock.json — published to site/marketdata/experiments.json, which
#     is read ONLY by the admin console's Experiments tab (engine/experiments_registry.py
#     docstring, admin/experiments.py:19). Not a user-facing surface, so not BC-2's.

# ── SELECTOR / IDENTIFIER TOKENS — masked in place, NOT whole-line skipped ───────────
#
# `.tr-validated`, `.val-chip.validated`, `{%- if x.validated %}` are code: a CSS class
# selector, a chained class, a dotted attribute access. They are not prose and must not
# be forced to cite a study.
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT A _STRUCTURAL ENTRY (the 2026-07-29 gap, closed here). It used to be
# one, written `[.\-]validated\b` — "a dot OR A HYPHEN before the token". A hyphen before
# the token is also how ENGLISH writes an adjective, so every claim phrased
# "backtest-validated", "Holdout-validated", "FDR-validated", "drawdown-validated" matched
# it, and because a _STRUCTURAL hit kills the WHOLE LINE those claims were invisible to
# BC-2 — no allowlist entry, no CI failure, no trace. Measured on the tree at that commit:
# 21 lines reached the gate only through that rule; 7 were genuine selectors/attribute
# access and 14 carried prose claims (the sector-cycles hazard tooltip on three surfaces,
# the anticipation stop-width tip, the BTC impulse alert's EN+zh conviction line on both
# its engine source and its render, the signal-lab capitulation row on three lines, a
# marketing north-star note, and three code comments). All 14 are adjudicated in the same
# change that narrowed this rule — 11 earned allowlist entries naming their study, 3 were
# reworded because no study backed them.
#
# THE NARROWING: the token must belong to a DOT-PREFIXED identifier. A hyphen alone earns
# nothing, which is exactly the selector/prose distinction the old rule could not draw.
# The lookahead requires the character after the dot to start an identifier, so '. validated'
# (a sentence boundary) and '.4validated' are not identifiers and stay gated.
#
# AND IT MASKS RATHER THAN SKIPS: only the identifier itself is excised (replaced with the
# _TP_CUT sentinel, same joiner and same reasoning as _mask_third_party — it sits outside
# every character class in _NEG_EN / _NEG_ZH / TOKEN, so an excision can neither forge a
# token nor let a negation lookback reach across the cut). The rest of the line is scanned
# normally, so a line that carries BOTH a selector and copy — e.g. dashboard.html.j2's
# `{%- if x.validated %}<span data-tip-en="...">` — no longer hides the copy behind the
# selector. Whole-line suppression was half the reason the old rule was invisible.
#
# Code COMMENTS get no exemption, deliberately: the estate already gates and allowlists
# them (see the 'validated drawdown-control channel' entry, whose backing names a
# baskets_desk COMMENT), and a comment that asserts something is either accurate — in
# which case it is cheap to word it accurately — or it is a claim like any other.

# ── ASCII-ESCAPED ZH — the other half of scanning JSON (2026-08-11) ──────────────────
#
# `json.dump(..., ensure_ascii=True)` is the stdlib DEFAULT, and it stores 已验证 as three
# pure-ASCII escapes (backslash-u 5df2, backslash-u 9a8c, backslash-u 8bc1). TOKEN matches
# CHARACTERS, and html.unescape decodes HTML ENTITIES — neither one sees a JSON escape. So
# a file can sit in SCAN_GLOBS, be read, be scanned, report findings, and still be
# structurally incapable of ever yielding a ZH one: the glob buys EN-ONLY coverage,
# silently.
#
# MEASURED on the tree at this commit, feeding the gate the exact landing-breach pair:
# literal-ZH blob → 2 findings (EN+ZH); the same blob at ensure_ascii=True → 1 (EN only);
# a ZH-ONLY claim escaped → 0. The EN twin is what rescued the bilingual case, so the hole
# bites exactly where a ZH string has no English sibling. site/prophet/showcase.json — the
# artifact that fed the breach — serializes at ensure_ascii=True, so the ZH half of the very
# pair this change exists to catch would not have been caught on recurrence.
#
# NON-ASCII ONLY, and surrogate PAIRS joined. Decoding an escaped newline (backslash-u
# 000a) would forge a real line break and desynchronise every line number the findings
# report; decoding an escaped quote (backslash-u 0022) would forge a quote and could split
# a mask's span. Escapes below U+0080 are therefore left exactly as they
# are, and so is a LONE surrogate (chr() of one is unencodable and would crash the scan on
# a malformed payload). Only real non-ASCII text is decoded — which is all a token match

# ── QUOTED THIRD-PARTY RESEARCH — structural non-claims, same family as _STRUCTURAL ──
#
# The research vault mirrors syndicated institutional notes (Goldman, BofA, …) into three
# render targets on the nightly path. Their text is not ours: the pages say so in the
# footer ("ratings and views are the authors', not ours"). 'validated' is ordinary English
# in economics prose, so without this every future note that happens to use the word turns
# main red on ci-pack-0 — far from the render that caused it — until someone hand-writes an
# allowlist entry that is not, in fact, a claim of record.
#
# SAFETY INVARIANT (this is what keeps the skip from weakening the gate):
#   Every PLATFORM-AUTHORED string on these pages exists literally in templates/research_*.j2,
#   which the gate scans with NO exemption. Third-party text reaches site/ only through the
#   named Jinja interpolations enumerated below. Masking those SINKS in the rendered copy
#   therefore cannot hide a claim of ours — the source of that claim is still gated, and so
#   is the rest of the rendered page (the .rr-gate paywall copy, the footer, the crawl-hub
#   chrome, the nav). This is a sink exemption, NOT a path exemption.
#
# Two independent conditions must hold before ANY masking happens: the file must be a known
# syndicated render target, AND it must carry that render's attestation literal. Everything
# else about the file is scanned normally.
#
# A region is ("span", open, close) — protect from the end of `open` to the start of the next

    #    externally published wire headlines verbatim, and 'validated' is ordinary English
    #    in market reporting — the 2026-08-07 red was a Sina headline, "Strong momentum in
    #    innovative drugs continues to be validated" (zh: 持续验证). The feed is regenerated
    #    nightly from ingested headlines, so a per-quote allowlist entry could never hold:
    #    tomorrow's tape brings a different sentence.
    #
    #    ATTESTATION: the feed container the template emits for the tape itself. It sits
    #    inside `{% if lead %}`, so a render with no headlines carries no exemption — and
    #    has no third-party text to mask either. A page hand-dropped at site/china_news.html
    #    without it is scanned in full.
    #
    #    SINKS — the three places h.* headline fields reach the page (template lines
    #    319 / 329 / 330). Everything else in the item is OURS and stays scanned: the theme
    #    chip (.cn-tag), the importance label (.cn-imp), the channel chips (.cn-cchip), plus
    #    the hero lead, the toolbar and the .cn-disc disclaimer around it. This is why the
    #    wrapper <a class="tp-item"> is deliberately NOT the region: it contains our copy.
    #
    #    data-search is a whole-LINE region, matching the report page's <meta … content=>
    #    rule and for the same reason — an attribute VALUE cannot be span-delimited safely
    #    when the builder renders with autoescape=False (build_china.py:1523), so a headline
    #    carrying a quote would truncate a span mid-value. The template emits the attribute
    #    alone on its line. The only platform strings that ride into it are the channel
    #    labels (engine.china_news.CHANNEL_LABEL / THEME_LABEL), which the tests assert
    #    carry no token — and which are re-emitted, unmasked, in the .cn-cchip chips.

# ── FILE → SURFACE (the `surfaces` half of an allowlist entry) ───────────────────────
#
# Every allowlist entry carries a `surfaces` list naming the page families its
# justification was written for. Until 2026-07-29 the matcher never read it, so matching
# was phrase-scoped only and a claim on ANY page passed if its phrase matched an entry
# justified for a DIFFERENT page/study (found live: the dashboard dislocation panel's
# "validated gate" rode the sector_central trend-gate entry). _surfaces_of closes that:
# an entry backs a claim only when the claiming file's surface set intersects the
# entry's `surfaces`. An entry with a missing/empty `surfaces` list backs NOTHING —
# fail closed, so a new entry must always declare where it applies.
#
# Derivation: basename minus the render/source suffix, minus a partial-template's
# leading '_' (templates/_risk_radar_card.html.j2 IS the risk_radar_card surface).
# Two structural facts of the estate make the rest:
#   - site subdirectories are per-item render families (site/sectors/XLB.html is the
#     sector surface; site/basket*/<name>.html are all the basket_detail surface);
#   - _SURFACE_EXTRA records ONE-TEMPLATE-MANY-PAGES render IDENTITY — one source file
#     written out under several names. Every row below is verified against the builder
#     that writes it, named in its comment;
#   - a report_* page also answers to 'report', the name the allowlist already uses for
#     that family (report prose entries are written per-episode, and every report quotes
#     the same PIT factor studies).
# _SURFACE_EXTRA is for identity ONLY, never for "this claim is also welcome over
# there": a shared PARTIAL is deliberately absent (its claims land on the pages that
# include it, and those pages belong in the entry's `surfaces`), and so is every
# engine-module → page rename. Widening scope is the allowlist's job, where the
# extension sits next to the backing that justifies it and a reviewer can see both.

# ── ENGINE SOURCE COPY (PY_COPY_GLOBS) ───────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (#3765 → #3790). BC-2 used to scan only RENDERED surfaces, so copy
# authored in engine/ was gated only AFTER a nightly render carried it onto a page — a
# day later, on a PR that did not write it. #3765 added an unearned "Validated HK
# rate/FX pressure" to engine/intl_recovery_quality.macro_backdrop, passed CI green, and
# reddened main on ci-pack-0 with the 2026-07-27 render; every open PR inherited the
# failure until #3790 landed. The claim now fails at its OWN PR, next to its author.
#
# WHY AST AND NOT A LINE SCAN. The #3765 defect was shaped like this:
#
#     "read_en": (
#         "Macro backdrop is shown separately from the price state. Validated HK "
#         "rate/FX pressure lives in the pullback radar; ..."
#     ),
#
# The field name and the token are on DIFFERENT LINES. A grep-shaped rule keyed on "a
# display-copy field name and 'validated' on the same line" would have sailed straight
# past the exact defect it was written for. Python folds implicit concatenation at parse
# time, so the AST sees ONE string: we scan the folded value and report the node's line.
#
# WHY FIELD-RESTRICTED, NOT WHOLE-FILE. engine/ carries ~939 token occurrences; scanning
# whole files the way templates/ are scanned surfaces 509 findings, essentially all of
# them code identifiers, enum values, `"validated": True` data fields, LLM system
# prompts, and research-registry bookkeeping. BC-2 targets DISPLAYED CLAIMS. Binding the
# scan to the fields that ARE display copy reduces that to 10 real strings — all of which
# this change resolves, so the rule ships with zero pre-existing debt.
#
# RELATION TO _STRUCTURAL_MASKS. `note` used to be a whole-LINE structural skip on the
# rendered side, so scanning it HERE was described as "the other half of that bargain" —
# gate the claim once, at the source, where a human can fix it. That bargain did not hold:
# on 2026-08-11 a `"note":` key anywhere inside the landing page's ~23k-char one-line
# `<script id="ph-data">` island suppressed the ENTIRE island, and a bilingual
# 'validated drawdown gate' / '已验证的回撤门槛' pair shipped live with BC-2 green. The
# rendered-side skip is gone (see the _STRUCTURAL_MASKS comment), so `note` is now gated on
# BOTH sides — at its engine source AND on the page — which is what the bargain always
# claimed to be worth.
#
# The house's display-copy marker is the bilingual `_en`/`_zh` suffix — there is no
# reason to translate an internal note into Chinese — so ANY suffixed field counts. The
# bare names below are the display-copy fields the codebase also uses unsuffixed.
# DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED (checked against the census): `notes` (plural — see the caveat
# below), `description` (LLM tool schemas in engine/neuralweb), and `reason` / `tier` /
# `verdict` / `status` (scoring enums and trace fields).
#
# THE `notes` EXCLUSION IS SCOPED TO PYTHON SOURCES, NOT TO THE WORD (corrected
# 2026-08-11). It was written as "research-registry bookkeeping, all internal" — true of
# engine/intl_claims' "W4-C7 VERDICT: CONTEXT (do NOT wire)", and false as a general
# claim: registry bookkeeping does NOT stay internal. scripts/build_measurement.py
# publishes data/cycle_pattern/truths.jsonl's `notes` verbatim into the null_library of
# site/measurementdata/measurement_data.js, a user-facing payload. That channel is gated
# by DATA_COPY_SPECS above — at the ROW, where a human can fix it — so the exclusion here
# stays correct for its actual scope (a `notes=` binding in engine/ Python) without
# leaving the published half ungated. Before adding a bare name back to this set, or
# removing one, check both halves: a field can be bookkeeping in code and copy in data.
