"""Sparse session-worktree profile — detector + one-command opt-in (policy R8).

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`research/WORKTREE_GC_POLICY.md` §0 R8: a full checkout of this repo is ~3.8 GiB,
of which `data/` 2.3 + `site/` 0.73 + `mockups/` 0.23 + `verify_shots/` 0.05 =
**87 %** is generated artifacts that a typical session never reads. At the
measured fleet cadence (~40 session worktrees/day) the 0-3 d ACTIVE window is a
~330 GiB standing working set that the GC sweeper structurally cannot reduce —
it only reclaims trees that are already finished.

On 2026-08-13 the Studio hit 1.7 Ti / 1.8 Ti (~100 GiB free) and self-hosted
runners ENOSPC-crashed twice. Arming the GC (#5502) drains the finished pool;
only a thinner per-tree footprint shrinks the active window. This module is that
second half: new session worktrees check out every directory EXCEPT the heavy
generated ones, and this CLI is the one command that opts back in.

THE HONESTY RULE (why this is a detector and not just a setup script)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A sparse tree must never make a guard or a test read GREEN for the wrong reason.
Two measured ways it silently can:

  * `scripts/check_template_site_sync.py` enumerates its own pair list by
    walking `site/`. With `site/` absent, `find_pairs` yields nothing and the
    paired plain-copy asset law reports "sync OK (0 pairs checked)" and exits 0
    — a vacuous pass on the exact guard that protects the render lanes.
    `render.yml` carries a long comment about the same failure mode reaching the
    lane itself ("would render, guard and COMMIT whatever subset of the tree it
    found — a truncated publish, not a red X").
  * tests that read the committed `site/`/`data/` trees fail with a confusing
    FileNotFoundError that reads like a real regression.

So every caller that needs a heavy tree asks `missing_dirs()` FIRST and refuses
or skips with `remedy_line()` in the message. Nothing is silently greened.

DETECTION IS NOT A DIRECTORY CHECK
----------------------------------
`(root / "data").is_dir()` lies in both directions, measured on this tree:

  * `site/` is absent entirely -> is_dir() False (correct, by luck)
  * `data/` survives as a 0-byte HUSK after `git reset --hard` -> is_dir() True
    while holding none of the 2.3 GiB it tracks.

The husk is why `git reset --hard` cannot be trusted to restore the profile
either. The authoritative signal is git's own sparse state: cone-mode
`git sparse-checkout list` is the include set, and anything HEAD tracks that is
not in it is omitted. The emptiness heuristic is only the non-cone fallback.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/worktree_sparse.py status        # what is / is not materialized
    python3 scripts/worktree_sparse.py auto          # new linked worktree: apply profile
    python3 scripts/worktree_sparse.py full          # opt IN to a full checkout
    python3 scripts/worktree_sparse.py sparse        # re-apply the configured profile
    python3 scripts/worktree_sparse.py add site      # materialize ONE excluded dir
    python3 scripts/worktree_sparse.py clean         # report stray writes into an
    python3 scripts/worktree_sparse.py clean --force # omitted tree, and delete them
Exit codes: 0 = success · 1 = failure (not a git worktree, git error, bad dir).

# `git sparse-checkout add` (and `disable`, which is the same hazard at LARGER
# scale — it materializes every omitted tree at once, ~3.31 of the repo's
# 3.8 GiB, where `add` materializes one) checks out a heavy tree file-by-file;
# a process that dies mid-loop (our own wrapper timing out and SIGKILLing it,
# an OOM kill, a session getting torn down) leaves whatever file it was
# writing truncated on disk AND a stale `index.lock` that git created but
# never got to rename into place (measured 2026-08-18: a 0-byte tracked JSON
# file plus a ~49-minute-old `.git/worktrees/<name>/index.lock`; reproduced
# deterministically here by racing a short subprocess timeout against a real
# `sparse-checkout add` — see tests/test_worktree_sparse_add_lock_safety.py).
# The originating report's own hypothesis ("the stale lock caused it") was
# WRONG BUT USEFUL: it correctly named the worktree state to look at while
# misattributing cause. The lock is a CO-SYMPTOM, not the trigger — the real
# mechanism is timeout -> SIGKILL -> a file already `open()`ed (which
# truncates) never receives its content write, and the same kill orphans the
# lock because the rename-into-place that would have cleared it never runs.
# ADD_TIMEOUT_S is exposed as a parameter so a test can shrink it instead of
# waiting on real timing. The 60s the module used to share with `_git()` was
# wrong by luck, not by measurement. Measured wall time for `git
# sparse-checkout disable` (what `full` runs — the LARGER hazard, since it
# materializes every omitted tree at once) over 12 fresh worktrees: median
# 24.89s, worst observed 83.49s — an ~8% exceedance rate against the old 60s
# cap. Page cache was warm for 11 of the 12 samples, coldest at 37.25s, so
# the median is optimistic. `disable` also performs a live promisor fetch to
# github.com inside the timed window (traced: `fetch --filter=blob:none` plus
# `index-pack --promisor`), so wall time is not bounded by local I/O at all —
# a stalled `git-remote-https` blows any finite cap regardless of its size.
# 300s is chosen from the TAIL and from failure asymmetry, not from the
# median: a cap costs a fast run nothing (it only matters when exceeded),
# while a tight cap buys a silent, destructive, non-idempotent failure. 300s
# holds every observed sample with 3.6x headroom over the worst (83.49s).
ADD_TIMEOUT_S = 300

# Grace period between SIGTERM and SIGKILL in `_run_git_timed`'s escalation
# ladder. Git installs cleanup handlers (removing `index.lock`, finishing or
# discarding the in-flight write) that run on SIGTERM and cannot run on
# SIGKILL — that handler running is what this grace period buys. 10s is
# generous for that cleanup (measured SIGTERM aborts land well under a
# second) while still bounded enough that a genuinely wedged process — one
# that ignores SIGTERM outright — dies promptly rather than hanging the

    a timeout-triggered kill from an ordinary nonzero exit so a failure
    annotation can say which. ``timeout`` is a parameter (not a hard-coded
    constant) so a test can shrink it to deterministically race a real git
    checkout instead of waiting out the production budget.

    Shared by ``sparse-checkout add`` and ``sparse-checkout disable`` — both
    materialize a heavy tree in one shot and are equally exposed to the
    SIGKILL-mid-write corruption this module guards against (`disable` is the
    LARGER hazard: it checks out every omitted tree at once, not just one).

    ``subprocess.run(..., timeout=...)`` sends SIGKILL on expiry, which is
    exactly what corrupts the checkout: git installs cleanup handlers
    (removing `index.lock`, finishing or discarding an in-flight write) that
    run on SIGTERM and CANNOT run on SIGKILL. So on expiry this sends SIGTERM
    first via ``Popen.terminate()`` and gives git ``TERM_GRACE_S`` to use its
    own cleanup handlers; only if git ignores SIGTERM for that whole grace
    period does it escalate to ``Popen.kill()`` (SIGKILL) as a last resort.
    The repair path elsewhere in this module stays as the backstop for that
    last resort (and for ENOSPC, which corrupts identically with no timeout
    and no lock involved at all) — this demotes it from primary defense to

    `git add -A` there ships catastrophic data loss to main.

    Deleting a stray is safe: the committed content is in git and the path is
    sparse-omitted, so removing the file restores the tree to exactly the state
    the profile asks for. It is still report-first (worktree_gc.py's idiom) —
    a session may have written into an omitted tree on purpose.
