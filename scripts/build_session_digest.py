"""scripts/build_session_digest.py — OIP E1 nightly session-digest builder (data only).

WHAT: after the close, reads the intraday options plane's archived per-minute stamps back
out of R2 and writes one settled session record per root — the Terminal→EOD bridge.  Zero
UI: this builder renders no page and touches no template.

INPUTS (all read-only, all absent-safe):
  R2 live_flow/surface/{ROOT}/dates.json      which sessions the poller archived
  R2 live_flow/surface/{ROOT}/{DATE}/idx.json the session's stamp list + true cadence
  R2 live_flow/surface/{ROOT}/{DATE}/{HHMM}.json
                                              per-stamp replay frames (netprem grid, spot,
                                              and — once the greek tap is armed — walls)
  R2 live_flow/tide/{DATE}.json               MARKET-WIDE signed tape archive (a sibling
  R2 live_flow/dte_tide/{DATE}.json           lane is adding these; absent today)
  site/options_structure/gex_state/{ROOT}.json   EOD flip + wall levels, vintage printed
  data/options_session/ledger.parquet         prior sessions (yesterday's close walls become
                                              today's open walls when the greek tap is dark)

NEVER READ: Supabase, `public.alerts`, or any user-scoped row.  Those are owner-scoped user
data under RLS; the digest is a system-data artifact and reading a user's alerts to describe
a market session would be a privacy breach for no product gain.

OUTPUTS:
  data/options_session/{DATE}/{ROOT}.json     the settled record (schema options_session.v1)
  site/session/{ROOT}.json                    the latest session, for future surfaces
  data/options_session/ledger.parquet         one row per (date, root) — NIGHTLY LANE ONLY

LANE LAW: every `data/` write — the dated records AND the forward-ledger append — is gated on
`engine.ledger_lane.nightly_advance_enabled()` (COLLECT_LANE=nightly, the shared helper, not a
local copy).  An off-lane run (replay, intraday probe, fastpath) refreshes only the `site/`
latest pointer, which is a display artifact nobody grades.  Ledger dedup on (date, root) keeps
the FIRST row, so a replay can add sessions but never rewrites one already on the record.

CLOCK LABELS ARE NOT TRUSTED: `engine/live_flow._minute_key` localizes naive exchange
timestamps as UTC before converting to ET, so the tide/dte minute labels run a whole timezone
offset early (a 09:30–16:00 session labelled 05:30–11:59).  Every label the digest emits goes
through `session_digest.clock_read`, which scores the whole label DISTRIBUTION against the
session window, declares itself ambiguous rather than guessing, and disarms itself once
`_minute_key` is repaired.  Fixing `_minute_key` is out of this builder's scope (it changes live
payload bytes and the Terminal's axis) and is filed separately.

DATE ARITHMETIC IS SESSION-DATE ARITHMETIC: gex_state stamps `datetime.now(UTC)` and the nightly
band runs after UTC midnight, so `asof[:10]` is D+1 for every real nightly run.  Vintages go
through `levels_vintage` → `lib.nyse_calendar.session_date`, never a UTC date slice.

READ SHAPE: the newest per-stamp frame already carries the FULL session (each file is the day
truncated to that stamp), so the arc/pace/pocket figures cost ONE object.  Only the price path
needs a request per stamp, and it is fetched as a ~256-byte RANGE read of each frame's head
rather than the whole file — fetching all frames in full is quadratic in bytes (measured 124.8 MB
for ONE root at the configured 120s cadence; the whole run costs 4.06 MB instead of 374 MB).
See `scan_session`.

PLACEMENT: serial step in daily.yml's `engine` job immediately after OEU M-CMD.  It must sit
AFTER the parallel band's barrier because it reads site/options_structure/gex_state/*.json,
which build_gex_board writes inside the cl_gex cluster — the same cross-phase-dependency
reasoning that puts build_options_command there.  The engine job also carries
COLLECT_LANE=nightly at job level and its "commit engine outputs" step already stages both
`data/` and `site/`, so no new commit path is introduced.

R2 READ PATTERN: the self-contained `_r2_client()` convention (scripts/build_flow_enrich.py,
scripts/mirror_terminal_context_r2.py, scripts/live_flow_poller.py), not
`scripts/publish_r2._client`.  Reasons: this builder does small GETs under the same
`live_flow/` prefix build_flow_enrich already reads, it needs none of publish_r2's
manifest/ETag/dir-mapping machinery, and publish_r2's client is tuned for 60 GB bulk syncs
(64-connection pool, 10 adaptive retries) which is the wrong failure profile for a handful
of small keys inside a 200-minute nightly job.

FAIL-SOFT: always exits 0.  Every absent or stale input degrades to a printed null with a
plain-word note; nothing is fabricated and no traceback escapes.  Annotations are emitted
with a bare `print(..., flush=True)` so `::warning` starts its line (a logger prefix makes
GitHub drop the annotation silently — tests/test_gh_annotation_line_start.py).

    READ SHAPE, and why it is not "fetch every stamp".  Each per-stamp file is the session
    TRUNCATED to that stamp, so the newest one already carries the FULL day's time axis and
    net-premium grid — the arc, the pace series and the pockets all come from that single
    object.  Fetching every stamp in full is quadratic in bytes: measured 124.8 MB for ONE root
    at the configured 120-second cadence (196 stamps x ~600 strikes), 374 MB a night at three
    roots.  So the reads are:

        dates.json + idx.json                    2 small objects
        newest readable frame                    1 object, ~1.3 MB at cadence 120 — the whole day
        first stamp's frame                      1 small object, for the OPENING wall map
        per-stamp `spot`                         1 RANGE read each (~256 B), not the whole file

    Measured for three roots at the configured cadence: 602 reads, 4.06 MB, 1.2s — against
    374 MB if every frame were fetched in full.

    `frame_for_stamp` drops `spot_path` and emits only that stamp's own `walls`, and `_full.json`
    is staged locally by the poller but NEVER uploaded (`build_and_stage_surfaces` queues only
    idx/stamp/dates keys), so the price path genuinely exists nowhere but spread across the
    per-stamp objects — hence a request per stamp, but only a few hundred bytes of it.

    With `spot_scan` off, only the tail window plus the first stamp are fetched; level-crossing
    events are then simply absent and the record says so.  A stamp that will not load maps to
    None — a gap in the tape stays a gap.

    The fifth return value is the list of stamps whose object actually answered, or None when the
    scan was skipped (nothing was verified, so nothing may be claimed).  The dated indexes are
    best-effort — a stamp can be listed while its PUT failed — and coverage must count what was
    read, not what was promised.

    `deadline` is a monotonic wall-clock budget: once passed, the scan stops and returns what it
    has.  Partial output that says it is partial beats a job the engine band cancels at its cap.
