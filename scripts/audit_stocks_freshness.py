"""Per-name freshness tripwire for the data/stocks/ single-stock price store.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-03 incident): data/stocks/<T>.parquet is written solely by
collectors.sector_holdings.StockPriceAdapter, whose fetch set used to be JUST
top10_union() — the union of the CURRENT top-20 holdings across the 11 sector SPDRs.
The moment a name fell out of every fund's top-20 it silently left the fetch set and
its parquet froze forever, while scripts/build_stock_library.py's universe() kept
preferring the frozen deep store over fresher breadth caches — nothing ever noticed.
Measured receipts: QCOM/HOOD froze 24d, MRVL 21d, CVNA/HON 17d, WDC 10d, SATS 46d (as
of this adjudication). collectors/sector_holdings.py now carries a retention fix
(_fetch_universe: union PLUS everything still on disk, minus confirmed-dead names) so
a dropped name keeps getting fetched going forward — but NOTHING previously audited
per-name tips: scripts/audit_prices.py checks interior gaps only (a frozen series has
no gap to find), scripts/check_price_store_freshness.py gates only SPY in data/yahoo,
and the Adapter-level stale_after_days convention is GROUP-level (one fresh name in a
235-name store masks 234 stale ones). This audit is the missing per-name tripwire.

WHAT IT CHECKS — accountable set = every stem under data/stocks/*.parquet (skip
leading-underscore stems) UNION top10_union() (a name the union just added but the
store hasn't caught up to yet shows as "missing", never silently absent):
  fresh        — lag <= cfg[stocks_stale_calendar_days] (default 7)
  stale_live   — lag > threshold, ticker NOT in the dead-name registry (a live alarm —
                 the fetch for this name is not advancing)
  stale_dead   — lag > threshold, ticker IS in the dead-name registry (counted for the
                 record, never alarmed — the name is gone for a documented reason, not
                 a fetch defect)
  missing      — ticker is in the union but has no parquet on disk at all
  unreadable   — the parquet exists but fails to read (corrupt/short file)

LAG ANCHOR (2026-08-03 correction): lag is measured from the ET calendar date of `now`
to the store's last bar date — NOT from lib.nyse_calendar.expected_last_session(now).
Anchoring to the expected session let an exact-boundary case (e.g. a freeze that lands
on a multiple of the trading-week cadence) hide under a `<= threshold` read that the
wall-clock calendar itself would call stale (WDC: last bar Fri 07-24, expected session
Fri 07-31 => exactly 7 days => inadmissible under the session anchor even though the
real freeze was already 10 calendar days deep by the time this audit ran on 08-03).
expected_last_session(now) is still computed and recorded in the marker doc as human
context, but it never participates in the flag decision. The THRESHOLD alone absorbs
weekends/holidays: the worst MODELLED consecutive-session gap on the 2000-2026
calendar is 5 calendar days (Hurricane Sandy, 2012-10-26 -> 10-31); the worst REAL one
is the 9/11 closure (2001-09-10 -> 09-17 = 7 calendar days — absent from
lib/nyse_calendar's ONE_OFF_CLOSURES) — exactly the 7-day default, admissible only
through the strict `>`, the same zero-margin contract as PR #4441's ledger gate
_MAX_BAR_LAG_DAYS. A Friday-tip store checked the following Monday (3 calendar days)
reads fresh.

EVERYTHING IS A FLAG, NEVER A FAIL (disclosure-only by law — DO_NOT_REBUILD CSP-R1,
"staleness is a flag"): every stale_live/stale_dead/missing/unreadable name is recorded
via Universe.flag(), never Universe.fail(), so n_failed is always 0 and the
run_quality_audits governance gate (scripts/collect.py) can never abort a run on this
audit's account. audit_prices.py remains the sole corruption FAIL authority for these
stores; this audit only discloses staleness, loudly, and lets a human (or a downstream
consumer) decide what to do about it.

SKIP: an absent or empty data/stocks/ directory (a CI checkout whose restore step did
not run, or one that has not yet populated the store) is skipped entirely — matching
the audit_prices/audit_massive_store convention that an absent backing store never
aborts a build.

Deterministic, READ-ONLY over the store; writes only
data/quality/stocks_freshness_audit.json. Wired into scripts/collect.py
run_quality_audits AND run as its own daily.yml step: the nightly lane runs
`collect.py --exclude-group asia`, which makes collect.py skip the WHOLE
run_quality_audits gate as a partial run (see scripts/audit_massive_store.py's
identical note) — so without its own step this audit would have zero nightly
coverage. The default exit code (used by both run_quality_audits and the daily.yml
step) is ALWAYS 0 for data findings — the annotation carries the alarm, never the
exit code. `--strict` exits 3 when any stale_live/missing/unreadable name exists. An
unexpected crash exits 2.
