"""scripts/check_self_mod_fence.py — F2 self-modification fence (R-AUT-5).

Checks whether a PR carries the loop namespace AND touches the IMMUTABLE set.
If both conditions are true, the PR is BLOCKED (exit 1).

Attribution is by namespace + trailer, NOT identity (R-AUT-5):
  - Loop namespace: branch prefix 'metabolism/' or 'claude/loop-'
  - Loop trailer:   'Loop-Authored:' commit trailer present in any commit on the branch

The IMMUTABLE set (hard-coded here and in the F1/F3 manifests):
  .claude/hooks/**
  .claude/settings.json
  .claude/settings.local.json
  .github/ci/**
  .github/workflows/**
  config/grader_manifest.yml
  config/capability_manifest.yml
  config/metabolism_budget.yml
  engine/neuralweb/capability_broker.py
  scripts/check_self_mod_fence.py
  scripts/check_grader_manifest.py
  research/AUTONOMIC_LOOP_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md   (the tier table lives here)
  engine/standout_audit.py               (SA-R2/SA-R4: US taxonomy constants + sensor defs)
  engine/china_standout_audit.py         (SA-R2/SA-R4: CN taxonomy constants)
  engine/standout_review.py              (SA-R4: clamp/whitelist enforcement engine)
  config/standout_review.yml             (SA-R4: coverage clamps + whitelist bounds)

Fail-CLOSED contract:
  - Unclassifiable inputs (can't determine branch, can't list files) → BLOCK (exit 1).
  - Any error in classification → BLOCK (exit 1).
  - Only CLEAR non-loop-namespace PRs with no loop trailers pass freely.

Human/operator PRs (no loop namespace, no loop trailer) always pass.
Loop PRs touching NON-immutable paths always pass.
Only loop + immutable is blocked.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check_self_mod_fence.py \\
        --branch <branch_name> \\
        --files <file1> [<file2> ...] \\
        [--trailers <raw_trailer_text>]

    python3 scripts/check_self_mod_fence.py \\
        --branch <branch_name> \\
        --files-file <changed-files.json> \\
        --trailers-file <commit-messages.txt>

    git diff --name-only -z <range> | \\
        python3 scripts/check_self_mod_fence.py \\
        --write-files-file-from-nul <changed-files.json>

    python3 scripts/check_self_mod_fence.py --selftest
    python3 scripts/check_self_mod_fence.py --print-planner-files

Exit codes:
    0   OK (human PR, or loop PR touching no immutable path)
    1   BLOCKED (loop PR touching immutable path, or unclassifiable input)
    2   --print-planner-files: the planner's list is malformed
    3   --print-planner-files: the planner published no list at all

--print-planner-files reads TWO sources, file first (2026-08-14, run
31775693780): ``CI_CHANGED_FILES_FILE`` names a file holding the list, and
``CI_CHANGED_FILES_JSON`` carries it inline. The file exists because the inline
form measured 350,264 bytes on PR #5578, past execve's 131,072-byte
MAX_ARG_STRLEN, and killed every pack at launch. Set-but-unreadable and empty
files are MALFORMED (exit 2), not unset: a transport that lost its payload must
fail closed, exactly like a truncated env string. Exit 3 means neither source is
configured, and only then may the caller fall back to git.
