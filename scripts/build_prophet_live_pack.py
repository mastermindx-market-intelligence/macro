"""scripts/build_prophet_live_pack.py — nightly Prophet Live arming pass (P0 D2).

Probes the SAME close-only admission gate the board is built from with candidate
provisional closes APPENDED as tonight's new session bar — the construction the
nightly itself runs — and publishes the resulting per-name trigger/fade levels to R2
as ``live_flow/prophet_live_armed.json``. The */5 evaluator reads that and never
re-derives a signal (research/PROPHET_LIVE_INTRADAY_SIGNALS_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md
§4.1). All compute lives in :mod:`engine.prophet_live.armed_pack`; this script owns
the universe read, the process fan-out, the budget deadline and the publish.

    python -m scripts.build_prophet_live_pack [--publish] [--out PATH] [--now ISO]
                                              [--workers N] [--limit N]

RUNS AFTER build_site inside daily.yml's engine job, non-fatal. It reuses
``scripts.build_stock_library.universe()`` so the close series it probes are the
exact series the board's own ``signal_gate.gate`` call site consumes — a second
loader would be a second definition of the universe, which is how two surfaces start
disagreeing about who is in it.

BUDGET IS LAW. One gate call is ~250 ms on this universe, so a full grid over every
name does not fit the render budget. The centre census (one call per name) is always
paid; the probe phase then runs under both ``max_probe`` and a wall-clock
``max_seconds``, and everything the budget cuts is counted in ``meta.skipped``.
Measured timings are printed on every run so a regression shows up in the log.

FAIL-CLOSED ON PARITY (G0.1). Before anything is published, the REAL gate is re-run
at every PUBLISHED price: at each edge (must be buyable) and at the false-side bound
the bisection actually measured (must not be). A name whose price the gate contradicts,
or that could not be checked inside the budget, has its thresholds WITHHELD — it ships
its honest centre state with no levels, and the evaluator drops it from coverage. Per
NAME, not per pack: one boundary case must not dark every other name, and a wrong price
never reaches a user either way.

Whole-pack refusal is reserved for structural failures: no ``as_of`` at all, armed
levels with zero re-verified prices (unproven is not clean), or a mismatch that somehow
survived the withholding.

The cheap membership check (``self_check`` / ``membership_mismatches``) still runs, but
it is NOT the gate and is no longer described as one. It reads the same numbers the
assembly wrote; fuzzing synthetic gates produced zero failures. It catches a
representation bug — only the edge check catches a wrong price.
