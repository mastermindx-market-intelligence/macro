"""CI lint: any desk brief rendering a conviction badge must carry a provenance PASSPORT (#41).

Audit #41: desk cards and the Calibration Hub display precise-looking conviction badges whose
measured basis is n=0 — indistinguishable from an earned number. The fix (Masterplan §W4) is a
SHARED render helper + a build check, not per-page patches. engine.passport is the helper; this
is the check.

Invariant enforced: every rendered desk-brief JSON (schema in _DESK_SCHEMAS) that surfaces a
directional conviction MUST include a top-level ``passport`` block whose ``state`` is one of
engine.passport.STATES. A cold desk then renders ``accruing · n=0`` instead of a bare
conviction word that reads as validated. New desk briefs are held to this immediately; the
handful of pre-existing artifacts that predate the passport are grandfathered in
``LEGACY_NO_PASSPORT`` — a list that only SHRINKS as builders adopt engine.passport.

Run:  python3 scripts/check_badge_passport.py site      # lint (exit 1 on a new offender)
      python3 scripts/check_badge_passport.py site --list
