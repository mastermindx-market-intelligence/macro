"""Bounded browser evidence capture + UX-smell census for registry-listed pages.

What this is
------------
An *evidence* tool, not a judge and not a crawler. It walks a fixed list of routes
taken from the product page registry (``data/product_experience/page_registry.json``,
schema ``mastermind.page_registry.v1``), loads each one anonymously in a real
browser, screenshots a declared state matrix, and records a set of literally
measurable page facts. It scores nothing, ranks nothing, and labels no page good
or bad — a heuristic here identifies a review target for a human, and that is the
whole of its authority.

Contract
--------
1. **Anonymous only.** No credential is ever entered, synthesized, or read. Free /
   Essential / Pro states are recorded as explicit *gaps* with a reason, never as a
   capture. Because the run is anonymous, no premium payload can enter the
   artifacts by construction.
2. **A state that could not be captured is recorded, never omitted and never
   faked.** Loading/empty/stale/error page states are gaps with a reason; a page
   that 404s or times out is ``captured: false`` with the error text. ``--force-state``
   (opt-in, off by default) can put the *presentation* of one of those states on
   screen by toggling the class or attribute the page's own CSS keys it off — and
   is labelled as exactly that everywhere it appears, because a forced class shows
   the state's styling, not data the page really returned. The gap row stays; it
   flips to ``captured: true`` with the forcing named.
3. **No browser is never a pass.** ``playwright`` is imported lazily inside
   ``playwright_page_driver``; a missing library or chromium binary raises
   ``CaptureUnavailable`` and the CLI exits nonzero with outcome
   ``verifier_unavailable``, writing no artifact over the committed evidence.
4. **The driver is an injected seam** (``PageDriver``). Tests supply an in-memory
   fake; production supplies playwright. Nothing in the test path imports a browser.
5. **Off the render path.** Never wired into CI or the nightly — a render-budget
   law repo does not spend 4 cores on screenshots. Run it locally.
6. **Screenshots are content-addressed and local.** ``evidence/<sha256[:16]>.png``
   is gitignored; only the manifest + smell report (which carry the digests) are
   committed.
7. **A console error names the asset it came from.** Each entry is
   ``{"text": ..., "source_url": ...}`` and every response the page took a 4xx/5xx
   on is listed separately in ``failed_responses``. The 2026-08 census recorded a
   bare ``"401"`` on 12 of 13 P0 pages and could not say which request produced
   it — an unattributable error is a dead end for the human who has to fix it.
   **Evidence outlives the load.** A page that 401s and then times out settling is
   exactly the page this exists for, so console errors and failed responses are
   carried out of a failed observation and harvested before any state is skipped.
8. **No subprocess, no directory enumeration, anywhere in this module.** Both are
   statically opaque edges, and ``scripts/ci_scope_dependencies.py`` widens a
   module carrying one to every ``data/**`` path it mentions — which re-reds the
   ci_pack narrow-diff contract through the ``product-experience-capture`` job.
   ``_git_head_sha`` therefore reads ``.git`` by hand and the self-check tracks
   the files it wrote instead of globbing for them. The tradeoff is real and is
   stated where it applies (``self_check``): a write ledger cannot see a file the
   manifest never names, which a glob could.
9. **Provenance is named, never asserted.** ``_git_head_sha`` reports the git
   directory that answered alongside the sha, and the manifest prints both — the
   walk finds the *nearest* ``.git`` above ``--site-dir``, which is not proof that
   that checkout produced the directory being served.

Locale/theme are applied the way the site's own toggle applies them
(``templates/theme.js``): ``setTheme`` sets ``data-theme`` on ``<html>`` and
persists ``localStorage.theme`` while clearing ``themeAuto``; ``setLang`` sets
``data-lang``, syncs ``documentElement.lang``, and persists ``localStorage.lang``.
Both are seeded pre-navigation *and* re-applied post-load through the page's own
``window.setTheme`` / ``window.setLang`` when present, and the state actually
observed on ``<html>`` is written back into the manifest.
