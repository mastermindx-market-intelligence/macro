"""Reconstruct multi-year index dealer-gamma HISTORY from the ThetaData T1 EOD store
(roadmap P1.1b / brainstorm §5.4) — replaces the ~20-row CBOE-delayed `market_gamma`
estimate with a 2017-> daily regime/levels series for the index ETFs.

WHAT IT DOES
------------
For each completed index-ETF root (SPY, QQQ, IWM, DIA), for every EOD trading date
in the greeks era (2017->), it rebuilds the per-strike option chain by joining the
ThetaData `greeks` store (gamma/vanna/charm + underlying_price + implied_vol) to the
`oi` store on (root, expiration, strike, right, date), then feeds the
[K, T, iv, oi, is_call, expiry] subset to engine.gex_engine.compute_gex — the SAME
pure function that produces both the live data/cboe/gex store and the live
data/polygon_gex summaries. Using that exact function is what makes the reconstructed
series sign- and scale-COMPARABLE with the live path: the dealer long-call / short-put
sign, the ±25% strike window, the ±25% zero-gamma grid flip, the $/1%-move net-GEX
scaling, and the "long above flip / short below" regime are all inherited verbatim
(engine/gex_engine.py). compute_gex RE-IMPLIES the greeks from iv via engine.greeks
rather than trusting the vendor's stored gamma — again matching the live path exactly.

Every emitted row is stamped reconstructed=True.

MID-WRITE / R-law: reads ONLY roots+years listed 'completed' in the live backfill
worktree's _backfill_state.json at run time; the exact (root, year) set read is stamped
into data/index_gex_history/_manifest.json. SPX / SPXW are index-native GEX candidates
but are NOT read unless the state file lists them complete (it does not today), so they
are recorded as EXCLUDED, not silently reconstructed with a divergent basis.

DISPLAY-ONLY: this is a levels / vol-CONTEXT series (net-GEX percentile-vs-own-history,
regime persistence). GEX score integration is a settled NULL — nothing here feeds a
score path.

STORE RESOLUTION (OIP E3c, 2026-07-29)
--------------------------------------
The ThetaData EOD store path is NOT hardcoded here any more. It routes through
engine.thetadata_store.resolve_thetadata_store() — the canonical single fallback chain
(THETADATA_STORE env -> lib.config data_dir()/thetadata_eod -> the ops-host worktree),
content-checked so an empty stub directory never resolves. The old module-level constant
pinned the ops-host worktree path literally — the fragmented per-module resolution the
options_witness empty-store incident came from. On any host without that exact path the
builder died with a bare SystemExit and the committed artifact silently froze (measured:
the store sat at 2026-07-02 while engine/market_gamma kept serving percentiles off it as
if current). That path now lives in exactly one place: engine.thetadata_store.

Nothing in CI or the nightly render reads the store — they read the COMMITTED
data/index_gex_history/*.parquet (and its R2 mirror). This script runs ONLY where the
store lives: the M1 ops host, weekly, via ops/launchd/com.macro.indexgexhistory.plist.

Output: data/index_gex_history/<ROOT>.parquet, one row per trading day.
Columns mirror compute_gex's summary plus: reconstructed(bool), root, source.
