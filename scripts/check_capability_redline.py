"""scripts/check_capability_redline.py — F3 capability-broker redline scanner.

THE REDLINE (the single unforgivable defect in the Metabolism):
    A secret value MUST NEVER land in a git artifact.

This script enforces that line by scanning:
  - config/capability_manifest.yml
  - engine/neuralweb/capability_broker.py

…for two classes of violation:

  1. HIGH-ENTROPY STRINGS — strings that look like they could be secret values.
     Pattern: 20+ contiguous base64 chars, or 40-char hex (API keys, tokens, SSH).
     Any such string in the scanned files is a hard failure.

  2. VALUE-CAPTURE PATTERNS — code or config that would plumb a secret VALUE into
     a tracked literal:
       - 'secrets.<name>' (GitHub Actions value reference)
       - os.environ[<name>] assigned to a tracked literal (in the broker)

     The broker is ALLOWED to reference os.environ key names in comments and
     docstrings (it documents that callers should do this).  The ban targets
     VALUE CAPTURE: `x = os.environ["SECRET"]` stored in a module-level or
     class-level constant.

Fail-closed: any scan error (file missing, parse error) → exit 1.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check_capability_redline.py           # scan; exit 1 on finding
    python3 scripts/check_capability_redline.py --selftest  # synthetic proof; exit 0/1

Exit codes:
    0   all clear
    1   one or more findings, or scan error

# check. This is NOT a blanket base64 disable: the 40-hex, secrets.* and
# environ-capture rules still run in full, AND a non-path base64 blob (no '/',
