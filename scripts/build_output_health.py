"""scripts/build_output_health.py — evidence gathering for Eval OS T4 (output health).

THE ADAPTER, NOT THE CONTRACT. Every rule about what a state MEANS lives in the pure
resolver :mod:`engine.output_health`; this file only goes and looks. It probes presence,
reads the one declared watermark field, normalizes the existing health surfaces
(freshness sentinel, R2 audit, Neural Web lobes, foresight legs, provider telemetry) into
the resolver's input shapes, and prints the resulting view.

IT WRITES NOTHING, EVER. The view is derived on demand and emitted on stdout — same
architecture as the T1 registry it joins against, and for the same measured reason: there
is no stable input to pin a committed health file against (``config/synapse.yml`` alone
took 69 commits in the trailing 14 days), so a committed artifact plus an equality check
would be a scheduled fleet-wide red. A caller that wants the view holds it in memory or
reads this JSON.

THE PRESENCE LADDER IS STORAGE-AWARE, AND ITS DEFAULTS ARE ASYMMETRIC ON PURPOSE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
``git`` / ``git+r2``   worktree file, else the blob at HEAD (``read_tracked``'s ladder).
                       A tracked-but-unmaterialized artifact read from HEAD is a REAL
                       observation, not blindness — that is what makes a sparse agent
                       worktree answer the same as a full checkout. Unreachable BOTH ways
                       is a definitive absence **only when git itself answered**; where
                       git cannot be consulted at all the same silence is blindness, and
                       minting 600 "unavailable" verdicts out of a broken probe is the
                       failure this asymmetry exists to prevent.
                       The HEAD half is answered from ONE batched ``git ls-tree``
                       (:func:`_head_blobs`) rather than a probe per artifact; a miss
                       there decides nothing and falls through to the per-path probe,
                       which remains the sole authority for every negative.
``gitignored-local``   worktree only. Absent means INVISIBLE FROM A CHECKOUT (the file is
                       written at runtime on another host), never ``exists=False``.
``r2``                 not probeable from here at all: ``exists=None`` unless the R2 audit
                       carries an explicit VERDICT for its anchor, in which case the
                       reader plane supplies presence. An anchor merely LISTED in the
                       audit is not a verdict about anything and yields no row: presence
                       is never fabricated from an inventory.
unprobeable paths      a `<SYM>` family, a directory, a glob, a ``YYYY-MM`` template or
                       ``embedded:`` prose is not one file — no probe, and a miss against
                       it is blindness rather than absence
                       (:func:`engine.output_health.unprobeable_path_reason`).

WATERMARKS: THE DECLARED FIELD ONLY
-----------------------------------
The governing field is ``staleness_from`` when declared, else ``asof_field``, and this
adapter looks for THAT KEY AND NO OTHER. When it is absent from the content it reports the
absence (``asof_field_present=False``) instead of reaching for whatever timestamp the file
happens to carry — ``engine/neuralweb/health.py``'s ``_AS_OF_KEYS`` fallback ladder is
deliberately NOT inherited, because a fallback makes a frozen store read fresh forever.

``--trust-mtime`` IS OFF BY DEFAULT. File mtimes in this repo are observer-stamped —
``git status`` sweeps, a Finder visit and ``reflog expire`` all rewrite them, measured
across the fleet pinning 137 of 143 dead worktrees as "fresh" — so from a checkout mtime
is not freshness evidence. A live-estate caller whose files are only written by their
producer opts in.
