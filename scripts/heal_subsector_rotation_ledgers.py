"""Heal the data/subsector_rotation/ ledgers — NYSE-session stamps + dupe quarantine.

One-time-but-idempotent data heal (forward-ledger calendar-asof audit 2026-08-05;
siblings: the Ignition Radar heal in #4568 and scripts/heal_basket_turn_ledger.py).

THE WOUND.  ``scripts/fetch_finviz_themes.py`` stamped its snapshot's ``asof`` from
the wall clock, and daily.yml runs it ~22:30 UTC SEVEN nights a week against an
end-of-day board.  The Saturday and Sunday runs therefore re-fetched Friday's
UNCHANGED numbers and stamped them with weekend dates.  That ``asof`` flows
straight into ``scripts/build_subsector_rotation.py`` and on into the three PIT
ledgers here, whose dedup keys all begin with ``date`` — so a weekend pass never
looked like a duplicate and appended a full fresh row set instead.  Downstream,
``engine.subsector_track_record.compute()`` graded each of those dates as another
IC day and another batch of by-stage observations: one Friday's calls counted up
to THREE times.

TRUTH SOURCE: ``lib/nyse_calendar`` alone.  Unlike the basket-turn heal — which had
to infer each row's true session from its members' price frames, because the wound
there was a run against a FROZEN store and only the tape knew what it had read —
this ledger family needs no price-store inference at all.  The defect is purely
calendrical: a non-session date cannot describe a tape, and the session a
non-session date re-describes is, by construction, the last session on or before
it.  The calendar is rule-arithmetic with zero data dependencies, so the inference
is exact and reproducible.

POLICY, PER FILE — first-writer-wins in FILE ORDER, so session-dated rows claim
their slots before any restamp can reach them:

* ``snapshots.jsonl`` (slot ``(date, key)``) — RESTAMP-OR-QUARANTINE, where the
  restamp test is the SESSION, not the slot.  A session the engine actually BUILT
  defines its own roster, and a weekend row may never join it: a weekend re-run can
  only contribute a key whose code shipped AFTER that build, so backdating it would
  insert a call the real build provably did not make.  (Committed example: the
  synthetic ``megacapgenerals`` node from ``_inject_megacap_node`` first appears on
  Sunday 2026-07-12 — the 268-name 2026-07-10 build had no such key, and this repo
  dates a coverage cliff to the FEATURE, not the data.)  A weekend row is restamped
  ONLY when the true session carries no pre-heal row at all: there the weekend run
  is the sole record of that session's tape and the code-era counterfactual is
  clean (Friday's fetch failed, Saturday recovered it).  Restamped rows carry
  ``session_inferred=true``.  Quarantine then splits into two honest classes:
    - DUPLICATE — the slot is already taken (by an honest row, or by an earlier
      restamped batch that a later weekend pass re-describes).  Carries a
      ``quarantined_kept_row`` pointer, which always resolves.
    - ROSTER — the true session was built but never carried this key.  There is no
      kept row to point at, so it carries ``quarantined_true_session`` plus
      ``roster_built_without_key: true`` instead of a pointer that would lie.

* ``turns.jsonl`` (slot ``(date, key, state)``) — QUARANTINE ALL, never restamp.
  These are turn-state-machine OUTPUT, evolved forward one fake session at a time,
  and the weekend rows carry claims the true session's own row set does not
  (verified on the committed data: ``cloudhyperscalers``/turn_up and
  ``commagrigrains``/turn_down exist only on 2026-08-01/02, with ``since`` fields
  pointing at those non-sessions).  Restamping would MINT Friday events that no
  Friday build ever produced — a fabrication, not a heal.

* ``universe_nominations.jsonl`` (slot ``(date, donor, receiver)``) — QUARANTINE
  ALL, same rationale: nominations are derived from the turn read, so a weekend
  nomination inherits the fake-session evolution above.

QUARANTINE, DON'T DELETE.  Nothing is ever dropped: every pulled row lands in
``<stem>_quarantine.jsonl`` with its ORIGINAL stamp intact plus the reason it was
pulled, so the defect stays auditable.  Untouched survivors keep their exact
original line bytes (only restamped rows are re-serialised), which keeps the git
diff to removals plus the in-place restamps.

FAIL-CLOSED: a missing ledger file, an unparseable JSON line, or a row whose
``date`` cannot be read aborts the ENTIRE heal across all three files before a
single byte is written — a row we cannot classify must not be silently kept OR
silently pulled.

IDEMPOTENT: a healed tree yields "already healed — nothing to do" and writes
nothing at all (byte-identical files, and ``last_heal`` is not refreshed on a
no-op).  Quarantine files are append-preserving across runs, deduped by each
file's own slot key.  No wall clock is read anywhere except the ``quarantined_at``
/ ``last_heal`` provenance stamps.
