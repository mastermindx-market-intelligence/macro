"""scripts/prophet_live_evaluator.py — the 5-minute Prophet Live intraday pass (P0 D3).

Loads tonight's armed pack from R2, reads the freshest delayed quote view, runs the
state machine in :mod:`engine.prophet_live.live_states`, and publishes the full state
map plus, when anything actually moved, an object-per-pass event spool row set.

    python -m scripts.prophet_live_evaluator [--dry-run] [--now ISO] [--root PATH]

WHERE IT RUNS (masterplan §4.2a, ruled 2026-07-30). The VPS systemd timer
``macro-live-prophet.timer`` is the product lane; ``.github/workflows/prophet-live.yml``
is a self-disabling backstop. GitHub's scheduler throttles this repo's frequent crons
far past the documented 15-45 min (measured: a ``*/5`` lane ran 09:07Z then 12:19Z),
so a 5-minute product cadence is not purchasable there at any price. The CODE is the
same on both hosts — same states, same gates, same artifact — only the host and the
quote source move.

QUOTE SOURCE, IN PREFERENCE ORDER (§4.2a fact 2).
  1. THE VPS LOCAL PLANE (``local_quote_paths``): files the systemd lanes publish by
     atomic rename on this same box — no network, no auth, no rate limit, seconds old.
  2. THE ESTATE MERGE (:func:`engine.marketing.live_verify.load_live_quotes`), which
     reads the repo checkout. On a GitHub runner that is the only source there is.
The fall-back is unconditional and silent for an absent plane: a host without
``/var/lib/macro-live`` is not broken, it is simply not the VPS. What the local plane
must never do is degrade a pass — a missing, unreadable or empty local file falls
through to the merge rather than raising or blanking the tape.

LEDGER LAW (G0.2). This lane writes NOTHING under ``data/`` and commits nothing. It
runs 80+ times a session; the nightly reconciler is the sole writer of
``data/prophet_live/``, and the nightly build remains the only thing that confirms,
grades or advances a ledger. The workflow has no write permission and no git step.
The ONE filesystem write on this path is the served copy (``served_path``), which goes
to the VPS live plane — outside the git work-tree, outside ``site.served``, and never
under ``data/``.

QUOTE AGE = FEED DELAY + POLLING GAP. Per-quote age is measured from the quote's own
timestamp, so it carries the vendor's contractual delay (~15 min for US single names)
before this lane has done anything at all. ``quote_max_age_min`` is therefore DERIVED —
``live.delayed_min + prophet_live.quote_slack_min`` — and only the slack half is about
our cadence (see :func:`engine.prophet_live.live_states.live_cfg`). Do not "tighten" it
back toward 12: that number cannot be met by a delayed feed at any polling speed, and
the resulting all-dark artifact looks exactly like a healthy lane.

HONEST DEGRADATION (G0.3). Three independent ways to be dark, all named:
  * pack missing            → whole artifact ``status:"dark" reason:"no_pack"``
  * pack ``as_of`` is not the last completed session → ``"stale_pack"``; yesterday's
    triggers are never evaluated against today's tape
  * per-name: no quote, quote older than ``quote_max_age_min``, an irregular gate,
    a name the pack could not probe, or a pack close that disagrees with the feed's
    previous close past ``basis_tolerance_pct`` (``basis_mismatch``, W-L0 gate 3) →
    that NAME goes dark with its reason while the rest of the artifact stays live.
No path invents a state, and nothing here says fired, confirmed or refuted.

ONE PRICE BASIS (W-L0 gate 3). The armed levels are adjusted store closes; the tape is
raw vendor prints. Both are NAMED on every payload (``meta.price_adjustment``) and the
per-pass assertion that they still describe the same scale — pack ``as_of_close`` vs
feed ``prev_close``, per name — is ``live_states.evaluate``'s first act. This script
owns only the LOUD half: the aggregate line, a ``::warning`` when names actually
mismatch, and a second one when NOTHING could be checked, because a feed that stops
publishing ``prevClose`` produces the same zero-mismatch count as a healthy one.

NO PANDAS ON THIS PATH. The workflow installs ``pyyaml boto3`` only.
``live_verify`` imports pandas lazily (inside its earnings helper, which this lane
never calls) and ``live_states``/``r2io`` are stdlib plus a lazy boto3, so the whole
import closure is thin by construction.

#:                     branch snapshot the merge path fetches.
