"""Daily collection entrypoint.

Usage:
    python -m scripts.collect [--full-history] [--only fred,yahoo,...]

Runs every adapter through the circuit-breaker runner. Never exits nonzero
because one source broke — the engine consumes whatever is fresh and the
dashboard surfaces staleness. Exits 1 only if EVERY source failed.

# Pure-REST collectors that are SAFE to run CONCURRENTLY. Verified by the collector
# audit: no akshare (segfaults under threads) and no yfinance (self-parallelizes and
# gets Yahoo-banned under an outer pool). The VALUE is the upstream HOST GROUP — members
# of the same group share one upstream host, so they run SERIALLY within the group (SEC
# fair-access <10 req/s across *.sec.gov; a single Quiver API host with no internal rate
# limit; CFTC); distinct groups run in PARALLEL. Each adapter writes its OWN per-source
# parquet and run_adapter only READS the shared status (written once, at the end), so the
# concurrency is write-safe. Everything NOT listed here stays in the serial loop —
# akshare china/hk, yfinance *_prices/*_universe/breadth, the crypto pullers, and
# canada_macro (multi-host incl. sandbox-unreachable FRED).
