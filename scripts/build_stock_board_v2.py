"""Buy Board 2.0 — SHADOW build (site/factordata/us_standouts_v2.json + preview page).

W6-US §W6, US-3. A NON-LIVE shadow artifact: it never touches the live board
(us_standouts.json), the live setups.json, or any linked page. It runs AFTER the
live board in the nightly flow, wrapped so a failure can NEVER break the render.

WHAT IT DOES
------------
Reads the two committed, already-computed US board artifacts —

  * ``site/factordata/us_standouts.json``  (rich rows: conviction verdict,
    composite_z, alpha, and the full compact signal-gate verdict per name)
  * ``site/factordata/setups.json``        (the honest is_buyable T1–T3 set,
    alpha-ranked; slim signal verdict, no conviction)

— UNIONS them into a candidate pool (no price math, no recompute → sub-second),
and applies the product's dual gate + rotation priority:

  WHAT-gate (trajectory / "good to buy"):
      verdict ∉ {Lagging}, composite_z > floor (config default 0, basis: prior),
      medium-term structure intact (weekly_bull + above200 from the signal read).
      The floor is MODULATED — never hard-gated — by group leadership:
      a leading group lowers the bar one notch, a washed-out group raises it.

  WHEN-gate (entry / "good entry, not chasing"):
      signal_gate.is_buyable(signal) as HARD admission — the SAME validated
      MACD-2D × StochRSI-3D confluence (T1–T4) that already guards setups.json,
      now guarding the board people read. Freshness window (cross within the last
      FRESH_SESSIONS), not-topped, extension guard — all read off the committed
      gate verdict, so we inherit the engine's own freshness/topped logic.

Two lanes, VARIABLE width (0..N, zero fill pressure):

  entry_open  — BOTH gates pass, fresh confluence cross.
  setting_up  — WHAT passes AND a cross is IMMINENT (about-to-cross): tier T4,
                or a small positive bars_to_cross, or momentum ε-close to a
                zero-cross. Every setting_up row is flagged provisional: true
                (partial-bucket caveat, audit #22) until the W6 replay validates
                the "about to cross" detector.

Ordering (never a hard gate): group leadership desc → edge percentile desc →
entry freshness. Concentration is surfaced + softly reported, not backfilled.

Sparse EVENT signals (insider / PEAD / 8-K) enter as an OR/max BONUS chip when
present — never renormalised into an average when absent (audit Q4).

Passports: every emitted number carries {basis, frame, freshness, n}. Every row
carries the two glyphs (edge grade colored by verdict; entry state = tier +
freshness) — NO fused 0–100 (that number anti-correlated with alpha; it dies).

FLIP-TO-LIVE is gated on US-2's ledger: v2 replaces the live board only when its
measured precision@k ≥ live. Until then this is unlinked preview only.
