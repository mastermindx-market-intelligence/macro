"""Exit-policy horse race on the US buy-lane episode cohort (Learning Loop G3).

WHAT THIS IS
------------
A MEASUREMENT-TIER study. It takes the SAME episodes the Track-record ledger already
scores — same buy lane, same contiguous-run grain, same next-session-close fill — and
asks one question the ledger deliberately refuses to ask:

    on identical entries, what does a holder-with-rules capture?

The ledger measures SIGNAL QUALITY and must stay policy-free (fixed horizon, forced
verdict) so eras and desks compare. This study measures TRADE MANAGEMENT. They are two
instruments, never one blended number (masterplan §1). Nothing here changes the public
track record, the board, or any weight; ``engine/track_scoring.py`` and
``scripts/grade_us_board.py`` are imported READ-ONLY and are not modified by this file.

WHAT IT IS NOT
--------------
Not a promotion, not a recommendation, not an authority claim. Every verdict in the
emitted report is descriptive ("shows", "in this sample"). Any policy that eventually
displaces the incumbent must go through its own pre-registration first (G4/G7).

THE POLICIES (identical entries, identical cohort)
--------------------------------------------------
  P0   incumbent as shipped — 10-session forced verdict, 3D-StochRSI>=80 target leg,
       90-session-trough x0.97 stop leg. This is literally ``track_scoring.score_episode``
       called with the grader's own parameters, so the calibration block below can
       reproduce ``site/factordata/us_track_ledger.json`` key-for-key.
  P0f  pure fixed H=10 — the SAME horizon with both early-exit legs removed. This is the
       policy-free reference the decomposition is anchored on, because the operator's
       question is literally about bar 10 ("winners extended beyond 10d, losers cut
       before 10d") and P0f exits every episode at bar 10 exactly.
  P1   pure fixed H=21.
  P2   ATR trailing stop, k in {2, 3}: exit at the first close below
       (running max close - k x ATR14). Hard cap H=63.
  P3   plan geometry: stop = the board row's own ``hold.invalidation`` when present
       (that IS the 90d-trough x0.97 level the desk publishes), else entry - 2 x ATR14;
       target = entry + 3R where R = entry - stop; first touch on closes; cap H=21.
  P4   breakeven-then-trail: P2 k=3 with a breakeven floor armed once a close reaches
       entry + 1 x ATR14. Cap H=63.

PINNED CONVENTIONS (each one is a choice; a reviewer should see it, not infer it)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* ATR14 is Wilder's, computed on the name's own daily bars UP TO AND INCLUDING the fill
  bar, then HELD FIXED for the life of the episode. A re-measured (Chandelier-style) ATR
  would make the stop distance a second, drifting signal; fixing it at entry keeps the
  horse race about the EXIT RULE. The re-measured variant was not run.
* The trailing anchor is the running max of {entry price} U {closes bar 1..t}. Including
  the entry price is what makes the bar-1 stop entry - k x ATR rather than undefined.
* Same-bar ordering in the target/stop walker: the STOP is tested before the target, so
  a bar that satisfies both resolves as a loss. Conservative by construction. On daily
  closes a single close cannot be both below the stop and above the target, so this is
  unreachable with well-formed geometry — it is pinned and tested anyway so a later
  refactor cannot silently reverse it.
* P4 arms its breakeven floor at entry + 1 x ATR14. Reading "+1R" as the trail's own
  initial risk (3 x ATR14) makes P4 PROVABLY IDENTICAL to P2 k=3 on every path — see
  ``walk_trail``'s docstring for the two-line proof and the test that pins it. An ATR
  multiple is therefore the only reading under which P4 is a distinct policy at all.
* EVERY STOP HERE IS CLOSE-ONLY. No walker looks at an intraday low: a stop fires when
  the SESSION'S CLOSE is through the level, and the fill is that close. A real stop
  order would trigger intraday and fill near the level, so the close-only convention
  (a) fills WORSE than the level whenever the close keeps falling after the break, and
  (b) never fires at all on a session that pierced the level and recovered into the
  close. Both effects are MEASURED and printed in the report's method and limitations
  sections — the counterfactual tests each session's LOW against the stop that was
  RESTING before that session opened (the previous bar's anchor), never against a level
  the session's own close created.
* MAE/MFE are CLOSE-PATH (the caches carry no intraday path for the walk), so both
  understate the true intraday excursion. They are measured over the policy's OWN HELD
  WINDOW — ``fwd[:exit_bar]`` — for EVERY policy row INCLUDING P0. Before 2026-08-03 the
  P0 row took its MFE/MAE from ``track_scoring.score_from_fill``, which measures the full
  10-bar forced-verdict window even when the incumbent's target leg exited on bar 3: one
  column pair of the headline table then carried two different definitions. Only those
  three columns moved — P0's P&L legs (``pnl``/``excess``/``held``/``exit``/
  ``exit_reason``) still come straight from ``score_from_fill``, so the calibration block
  is untouched and still reproduces the shipped ledger key-for-key. The price of the
  unification: the P0 ROW's mfe/mae/capture are no longer the ledger's own numbers (the
  ledger keeps the full-horizon window). The Calibration table is the ledger-comparable
  surface, and it is the one that says so.
* ``capture`` = median(realised / MFE) over that held window, and is UNDEFINED when
  MFE <= 0. A position that never traded above its entry inside the window has no
  favourable excursion to capture, and realised/MFE there is a ratio of two negatives
  that prints as a healthy-looking positive. Those rows are excluded from the median and
  COUNTED in the report instead of being averaged in.

INEQUALITY CONVENTIONS (two families, leaning opposite ways on purpose)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
* STRICT ``<`` — the SYNTHETIC bands. ``walk_trail`` exits only on a close BELOW
  ``anchor - k*ATR``; a close exactly ON the band holds. The band is an artefact of the
  rule, not a level anyone published, so a touch is not a break. It is also the grader's
  own convention (``track_scoring.score_from_fill`` uses ``p < stop_level``), which is
  why P0's trough stop is read from the grader rather than re-implemented. Leans toward
  HOLDING — fewer stop exits.
* INCLUSIVE ``<=`` / ``>=`` — the PUBLISHED levels. ``walk_target_stop`` exits on
  ``p <= stop`` and on ``p >= target``. The desk publishes the invalidation LEVEL, so
  trading at it is trading through the thesis; the target is kept symmetric with it.
  Leans toward EXITING — more plan exits.
* INCLUSIVE — the breakeven arm (``p >= entry + m*ATR``): reaching the arm level arms
  the floor. The anchor itself updates on strict ``p > anchor``, which is immaterial: an
  equal close leaves the anchor where it already is.
* Elsewhere: maturity is INCLUSIVE (``n_avail >= horizon``, ``len(fwd) >= min_bars`` —
  exactly ten bars is matured, not immature); a WIN is strict ``> 0`` with no dead band
  (``track_scoring.summarize``); ``capture`` requires strict ``MFE > 0``.
Both directions of each boundary are pinned in tests/test_exit_policy_study.py, so a
refactor that loosens or tightens one goes red rather than quietly re-scoring the study.

CENSORING — the load-bearing caveat
-----------------------------------
The record starts 2026-06-30 and the close caches end 2026-07-31. The matured-at-10
cohort therefore has 11..21 forward bars available; NOTHING has 63, and only the first
board day has 21. A policy with a 21- or 63-bar cap will frequently still be holding
when the data runs out. Those rows are NOT dropped (dropping them would delete exactly
the positions that were still running — the outcome-conditioned denominator
``track_scoring``'s rule 1 exists to forbid). They are MARKED at the last available
close and flagged ``data_end``; every policy row prints its ``data_end`` count. A
data_end row is a MARK, not a realised exit, and its hold length is a LOWER BOUND.
Read the cap-63 rows as "what these rules were holding on 2026-07-31", not as
"what these rules returned".

Every one of those marks lands on the SAME session — the last close in the caches — so
the whole treatment is concentrated on one day's tape rather than spread across the
sample. ``run_study`` therefore also re-runs the entire horse race with the panel
truncated by one session (``truncate_cohort``) and prints how far each policy's delta
moves; that shift is the honest size of the terminal-mark dependency.

STATISTICS
----------
Daily boards overlap heavily; episodes surfaced on the same night are one bet, not N.
Every interval here is ``track_scoring.date_block_ci`` — resampling WHOLE BOARD DAYS,
seeded — and ``n_board_days`` is printed beside ``n_episodes`` everywhere. Policy-vs-P0
comparisons are PAIRED per-episode deltas (same entry, same window) with a blocked CI
on the mean delta. No p-values are computed: with 8 blocks a per-policy p-value would be
a decoration, and the block structure is the only thing that makes the interval honest.

THE BLOCKS THEMSELVES OVERLAP, and the CI does not know it (masterplan §0 G3). Two
neighbouring board days hold the SAME 10 forward sessions minus one or two, so their
episodes ride the same tape: the block bootstrap treats those blocks as independent
draws when they are mostly the same week priced twice. The effective sample is therefore
MATERIALLY SMALLER than the printed ``n_board_days``, every interval here is too narrow,
and a bolded "excludes 0" is a weaker statement than it looks. ``window_overlap``
measures the actual session sharing (neighbour overlap, plus the largest set of board
days whose windows share no session at all) and the report prints it beside every place
that flag appears. No correction is applied — a correction would need a covariance model
this sample cannot support; the overlap is DISCLOSED instead.

Run:  python -m scripts.exit_policy_study                 # writes reports/exit-policy-horserace.md
      python -m scripts.exit_policy_study --json out.json # also dump the raw result dict
      python -m scripts.exit_policy_study --live --out /tmp/today.md   # today's caches

The committed report renders from the PINNED VINTAGE, not from the live caches — see
``VINTAGE_FIXTURE`` and ``main`` below for why the default had to move.

    close is folded into the anchor BEFORE the test (a new high can never trip its own
    stop, so the order is immaterial for well-formed k>0 — it is pinned for clarity).

    ``breakeven_arm_atr`` is P4: once a close reaches entry + m*atr the effective stop
    floor becomes the entry price and never goes back below it.

    ``lows`` is the CLOSE-ONLY COUNTERFACTUAL and changes nothing about the exit. The
    session's low is tested against the stop that was RESTING before that session — the
    previous bar's anchor, i.e. the level a real order would have carried into the open —
    never against a band this session's own close raised. Testing against the same-bar
    stop would count an up-then-down session as an intraday break purely because the
    morning's new high lifted the band under it.

    WHY THE ARM IS EXPRESSED IN ATRs AND NOT IN R
    --------------------------------------------
    "Breakeven after +1R, then trail at k" has two readings, and one of them is a
    mathematical no-op. If R is taken to be the trail's OWN initial risk (k*atr), then at
    the moment the floor arms the close is already >= entry + k*atr, so the anchor is too,
    so the trailing stop is already >= entry — and the anchor never falls, so it stays
    there. ``max(trail, entry) == trail`` for every subsequent bar and the policy is
    IDENTICAL to plain ``walk_trail(k)`` on every path. That identity is proved by
    construction and pinned in tests/test_exit_policy_study.py; it is why this parameter
    is an ATR multiple. P4 arms at +1*atr, where the floor genuinely binds over the
    region between +1 and +k ATRs — which is the whole point of a breakeven rule.

    The operator's question is "let winners run, cut losers short — what does each half
    actually buy us?". Each half has a benefit leg AND a cost leg, and a decomposition
    that prints only the benefit legs is an advert. So every episode lands in exactly one
    of five buckets, keyed on the POLICY's exit bar versus the anchor's, and on how the
    ANCHOR called the trade:

      extended_winner  held past bar 10, anchor had it green  -> "let winners run"
      extended_loser   held past bar 10, anchor had it red    -> the cost of that
      cut_winner       exited before bar 10, anchor had it green -> the cost of cutting
      cut_loser        exited before bar 10, anchor had it red   -> "cut losers short"
      same_bar         same exit bar; contributes exactly 0 by construction

    Each bucket's CONTRIBUTION is sum(delta in bucket) / n_total, so the five
    contributions sum to the overall mean delta exactly. That identity is unit-tested.

    It also has to survive ROUNDING, or the reader never sees it. Rounding each part
    independently is what the report used to print, and it broke the identity ON THE
    PAGE: P3's halves printed −0.45 and −0.15 against a net of −0.59, and its five parts
    summed to −0.52 against a printed total of −0.53. So every part also carries a
    ``display_pp`` — a LARGEST-REMAINDER rounding of the same exact contributions, where
    each part is within half a display unit of its own value AND the printed parts add up
    to the printed net. The report prints ``display_pp``; ``contribution_pp`` keeps the
    independently-rounded value for anyone reading the JSON dump.

    A ZERO DELTA MEANS "SAME CODE **AND** SAME INPUTS" — NOT "SAME CODE" (2026-08-06).
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This block compares a LIVE recomputation against a COMMITTED artifact, so it is only
    ever exact when one nightly run wrote both. Two input movements break it with no code
    change whatsoever, and the 2026-08-06 failure carried both at once:

      * FRONTIER — `daily` died 08-02..08-06, but its *collect* step still committed
        prices on 08-06 (caches 07-31 -> 08-05) while the *grading* step never re-ran.
        The shipped ledger was graded through 07-31. Three extra sessions matured 84 more
        episodes across 3 more board days: the n_matured / n_board_days deltas.
      * VINTAGE — that same collect RE-ADJUSTED 240 *historical* closes across 12
        dividend names (OKE, AMP, SYF, EQT, NRG, C, ...) by 0.56..1.18%, the ordinary
        total-return re-adjustment that lands on a new ex-date. ~6 marginal verdicts
        flipped and median_hold moved 9->10: 12 further deltas that SURVIVE any date clip.

    So a date clip cannot restore like-for-like, and neither can any field on the shipped
    artifact: `as_of` is `boards[-1]["as_of"]` (the last BOARD date, advanced by a
    different lane than prices), and `meta.continuity.last_session` is deliberately a
    THIRD lane's clock (SPY) — it read 08-04 while grading had seen 07-31.

    Reconstruction FIDELITY is therefore pinned against a frozen input slice instead:
    ``tests/fixtures/exit_policy_vintage`` (regenerate with
    ``scripts/build_exit_policy_vintage_fixture.py``). Against that slice this function
    returns ``exact_match`` and every delta is 0, so a non-zero delta there — and only
    there — means the reconstruction drifted. Against LIVE inputs the honest reading is
    ``coupling``: whether the ledger and the price caches came from the same run.
