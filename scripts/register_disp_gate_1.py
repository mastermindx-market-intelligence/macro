"""scripts/register_disp_gate_1.py — Register the DISP-GATE-1 experiment.

Per §6.2 of CODEX_NW_GAP_MAP_ADJUDICATION_BY_FABLE.md and
research/dispersion/L3_PREREG.md.

6 primary cells:
    regime arm {lean_in, neutral, lean_out}
    × basis {expanding-window (primary), trailing-252d (sensitivity)}

Declared budget: 6  →  post-B2 pooled sum = 31 (15 + 10 + 6).

SPY-21d contemporaneous drawdown covariate is a registered design obligation
(L3_PREREG design obligation 2) — reported as tercile-split adjustment WITHIN
cells, not as extra verdict cells.

Run:
    cd /path/to/repo && python scripts/register_disp_gate_1.py
