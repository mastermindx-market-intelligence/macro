"""Demonstration: honest trial accounting drops the Deflated Sharpe.

Runs the keystone end-to-end on a fixed-seed synthetic strategy that mirrors a typical
phase0 search: a grid of vol-window x target x cap configs is swept, the BEST config's
Sharpe is reported, and the DSR is asked "is this edge real after multiple testing?".

It shows the gap between:
  * the LOWBALLED literal n_trials a script might hand-write (e.g. "~6 variants"), and
  * the HONEST count the Trial Ledger records by logging every config AT GENERATION.

The honest count yields a strictly larger multiple-testing haircut, so the DSR — the
probability the edge survives selection bias — falls. That fall is the entire point of
P3 in research/SELF_IMPROVING_AI_SUITE.md: it removes the caller's discretion to
understate how many darts were thrown.

Run from the repo root:  python3 -m scripts.trial_ledger_demo
