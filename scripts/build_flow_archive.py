"""scripts/build_flow_archive.py — dated tide/dte_tide archives for the live-flow poller.

WHY THIS EXISTS (OIP W0, T-lane). `live_flow/tide_current.json` and
`live_flow/dte_tide_current.json` are OVERWRITTEN every poller cycle, so at 16:05 ET the
session's story is gone: nothing can read back what the tide did today. This module adds a
second, DATE-KEYED copy of the very same bytes —

    live_flow/tide/{YYYY-MM-DD}.json          live_flow/tide/dates.json
    live_flow/dte_tide/{YYYY-MM-DD}.json      live_flow/dte_tide/dates.json

— so the day's FINAL write is the settled record the nightly Session Digest (OIP E1,
research/options_estate/OIP_MASTERPLAN.md §6 E1 / §7) reads at the close.

The payloads need no change: `engine/live_flow.build_tide_current` and
`build_dte_tide_current` already emit the FULL-SESSION cumulative series (every minute of
`market_tide_minutes` / `sector_tide` / `dte_tide` from the open, cumulated), not
instantaneous state — so the last write of the day is by construction the whole day. This
module therefore never touches the payloads or the current keys: it re-uses the local file
the poller already wrote and queues ONE extra R2 key for it. One write, two keys — the live
copy and the archived copy can never disagree byte-for-byte.

Ledger law (CLAUDE.md §Ledgers, OIP §0.9): this is a live intraday lane. It writes ZERO
`data/` artifacts — only the gitignored `data/live_flow_out/` staging dir (.gitignore:340)
and R2. Nothing here advances a forward ledger.

Idiom credit: this is the per-family twin of the per-root dated-surface layout in
`scripts/build_flow_surface.py` (`dated_surface_keys` / `merge_surface_dates` /
`prune_surface_dates`), and re-uses that module's `is_session_date` / `cadence_label`
helpers so the two families can never disagree on what a session date is. Differences:
  • the tide families are market-wide SINGLETONS (one file per session, not per root), so
    the index is keyed `family`, not `root`;
  • retention is 30 sessions, not 10 (§7: the digest ledger is the durable record, but the
    archives must outlive a long weekend plus a digest outage — surface archives stay 10);
  • `dates.json` is re-staged and queued EVERY cycle, so a missing or corrupt index heals in
    the SAME cycle — a `--once` / `--rth-only` run (the plist's own cold-start recipe) must
    never exit having deferred its heal to a cycle that will not run (#3499 / #F3-04).

Reader contract (for the digest lane): `dates.json` is a BEST-EFFORT index, not a warranty.
It never promises a session the retention prune has already deleted (the list is trimmed to
`retain`), but a listed session CAN still 404 — the local ledger records a date in the same
cycle that queues its upload, so a failed R2 PUT leaves the index one session ahead of the
store. Readers must tolerate a miss and print the gap rather than assume coverage.

Never a CI module — nothing here prints GitHub annotations (§0.15 n/a); it runs only inside
the launchd poller on the M1. Every public function is pure or fail-soft: a failure in this
lane must never cost the poller a cycle or blank a current key.
