"""Regenerate the pinned exit-policy calibration fixture (Learning Loop G3).

WHY THIS FIXTURE EXISTS
-----------------------
``tests/test_exit_policy_study.py`` makes two claims about committed artifacts: that the
study reproduces ``site/factordata/us_track_ledger.json`` key-for-key, and that
``reports/exit-policy-horserace.md`` matches a fresh render. Both were checked by
recomputing from the LIVE price caches — which makes them green only while one nightly
run wrote every input, and red the moment the lanes desync. On 2026-08-06 they went red
together with nothing wrong in either artifact or in the code:

  * FRONTIER — `daily` failed 08-02..08-06, but its *collect* step still committed prices
    on 08-06 (caches 07-31 -> 08-05) while the *grading* step never re-ran. 84 more
    episodes matured across 3 more board days than the shipped ledger had graded.
  * VINTAGE — the same collect RE-ADJUSTED 240 *historical* closes across 12 dividend
    names by 0.56..1.18% (ordinary total-return re-adjustment on a new ex-date), flipping
    ~6 marginal verdicts. These deltas survive ANY date clip, so no ``as_of`` pin can
    recover like-for-like.

Reconstruction fidelity is a property of the CODE, so it is pinned to a frozen INPUT
SLICE rather than to a date (the #4744 lesson: pinning the END leaves the START rolling;
here pinning the DATE leaves the VINTAGE rolling). Against this slice the study is exact
and the committed report renders byte-identical, so a failure there means the
reconstruction really did drift. Live-lane desync is reported separately, and warn-only,
by ``exit_policy_study.coupling_warning``.

WHAT IT WRITES
--------------
A ROOT-SHAPED tree, so ``load_prices(root)`` / ``load_board_days(root)`` /
``run_study(root)`` exercise the real production loaders unmodified — a bespoke fixture
loader would let the loaders themselves rot untested:

    tests/fixtures/exit_policy_vintage/
      data/breadth/_{closes,high,low}_cache.parquet   sliced to the cohort's tickers
      data/yahoo/SPY.parquet                          benchmark closes
      data/us_board_ledger/snapshots.jsonl            distilled to the fields read
      data/us_board_ledger/retro_grades.parquet       distilled to (as_of, lane, ticker)
      site/factordata/us_track_ledger.json            as_of + summary + meta
      MANIFEST.json                                   provenance of all of the above

USAGE
-----
    python3 scripts/build_exit_policy_vintage_fixture.py            # auto-detect the ref
    python3 scripts/build_exit_policy_vintage_fixture.py --ref <sha>

The default ref is the commit that last wrote the shipped ledger, i.e. the one commit at
which the ledger and the caches are known to agree. The script REFUSES to write a fixture
that does not reproduce both artifacts exactly, so a bad ref fails here rather than
shipping a fixture that pins the wrong numbers.
