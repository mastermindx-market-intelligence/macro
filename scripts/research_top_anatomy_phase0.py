"""TOP ANATOMY Phase-0 harness — extended-move anatomy: topped vs continued.

Runs the frozen construction in `research/top_anatomy/TOPA_PHASE0_PREREG.md` §4
over two tracks and writes the two committed artifacts: a vintage-stamped summary
JSON and `reports/top-anatomy-phase0.md`.

THE QUESTION. Among days when a name is ALREADY EXTENDED, does anything
point-in-time separate the days that go on to top from the days that keep going —
beyond what extension magnitude and realized volatility already separate (they
are matched away)? Never "collapsed names vs average names": extension is a
prerequisite for some tops, not proof of one, so the only honest contrast is
extended-that-topped against extended-that-continued.

WHAT RUNS (prereg §4–§5)
  E1   36 features x matched-control contrast, month-block CI, BH-FDR within family
  E1b  pooled AUC increment over an extension-only baseline (grouped + walk-forward)
  E2   lead-time profiles -> EARLY / MID / LATE / POST-TOP CONFIRMATION labels
  E3   descriptive first-crossing ordering of survivors
  E4   era and dollar-volume-tercile sign stability
  G0.2 delisting verification (the Wide track's dead names, named not assumed)
  Today's tape: the current extended cohort with its feature readout

TIER. Research / display tier, zero scored authority; AVOID-not-SHORT (the outputs
are entry-side avoidance and trim-conviction CONTEXT, never a directional bear
position and never an exit rule). A discovery phase-0 has no program kill on a
null: a well-powered null re-scopes Wave-1 copy, it does not close the search.

DATA HONESTY
  * Track W (`data/massive_stock_day`, the registration track) is UNADJUSTED; split
    repair reuses the canonical yahoo-verified `scripts.replay_standout_pipeline
    .split_adjust`. Dividends are not adjusted (a small stated downward drift).
  * Tickers get REUSED. Every ticker's tape is cut at interior gaps > 60 sessions;
    Track W's declared `sanity-segmented` repair arm also cuts residual repaired-
    close up-jumps >=3x. Neither seam may contribute history to the next identity.
  * Track D (`engine.price_ladder` adjusted rungs, first-rung-wins) is a CURATED
    universe: names that topped and died are underrepresented, so its topped-arm
    severity is understated. Every D table says so.
  * The run's last data day is derived FROM THE PANEL, never from a manifest, and
    stamped on every artifact alongside the git sha.

W2 TIER-WIDENING ARMS (`--w2-arm`, `research/top_anatomy/TOPA_W2_PREREG.md`)
  The same pipeline with ONE moved variable: the §4.1 trigger term, taken from the
  engine's existing `extended_mask(variant=...)` arms (`r63`, `atrz`). Track W only.
  Each arm reports two panels — FULL (all arm episodes) and DISJOINT (arm episodes
  sharing zero EXT days with the phase-0 primary mask, where the generalization
  claim lives) — a §5 coverage gate that leads the result, five one-sided
  confirmatory legs, and the other 31 features as exploratory. No engine change.

PHASE-1 CONTROL CONSTRUCTIONS (`--p1-panel/--p1-construction`,
`research/top_anatomy/TOPA_PHASE1_PREREG.md`)
  The same pipeline again with ONE moved variable one layer further down: how
  CONTROL observations are selected and stratified. AM (anchor-matched) restricts
  control candidate days to fresh 63d highs and draws ONE day per continued episode;
  DM (duration-matched) adds an episode-age tercile stratum to the frozen W4 key and
  draws episode-first too. Three panels (the phase-0 primary cohort and W2's two
  DISJOINT cohorts) x two constructions = six runs, three registered legs each, the
  construction's own matching leg printed as an ungraded diagnostic, mandatory era
  stratification, printed sensitivities and the full 36-feature exploratory table.
  No engine change: the cases, features, snapshots, collapse and bootstrap are the
  frozen phase-0 chain.

AM-v2 ANCHOR-DISTRIBUTION CONSTRUCTIONS (`--p1-construction am2|am2_agefree`,
`research/top_anatomy/TOPA_AMV2_PREREG.md`)
  The successor to AM, which pinned controls at `days_since_63d_high == 0` and
  REVERSED the anchor asymmetry against cases measured at the {21,10,5} snapshots.
  AM2 is the DM path — episode-first draw from every continued EXT day, episode-age
  tercile stratum, frozen W4 key — plus ONE moved variable: a hard per-case-snapshot
  anchor caliper at NN time (`|control F3 − case F3| <= 2`). AM2-AGEFREE is the same
  caliper with NO age stratum, so `F1_episode_age` has one construction that can read
  it. Both arms of the registered escalation (caliper <= 2 and <= 1) are computed in
  every run, each with the SIGNED validity diagnostic that GOVERNS (§1: |point| <= 1,
  CI inside (−2, +2), no positive reversal).

    silently deletes the thin-coverage names the study cares about).

    stays on one side. CV-B: expanding walk-forward by calendar quarter with a
    250-SESSION purge between train end and test start — the full race-label
    horizon, because a training row's label can be resolved by bars up to 250

    Display-tier reporting, computed AFTER the confirmatory results were read and

    does the discovered leg say about the cohort that exists on the vintage date",
    which is the current-cohort question phase-0's G0.5 red-team asked of D3.

    Three levels are put side by side on ONE construction: the roster's own value on
    the vintage date, the DISJOINT panel's topped-episode value, and that panel's
    matched-control value. Case and control levels are aggregated exactly as §4.5
    aggregates the contrast — per case the control arm is the MEAN of its finite
    controls, then each episode collapses to the median over its {21,10,5}
    snapshots, then the median is taken across DISTINCT EPISODES — so the two are on
    the same footing as the Δ the arm reports, not a snapshot-pooled lookalike.

    The fire threshold is READ from the arm's own DISJOINT ruler leg rather than
    recomputed, so "at or beyond" means the same thing here as it does in the ruler.
