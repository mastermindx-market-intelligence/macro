"""Factor Intelligence panel builder — Block-A + Block-B + Twin + DNA + style_regime.

OFF-RENDER-PATH PLACEMENT: this script is a standalone nightly step that runs
BEFORE build_site.py in CI.  It writes data/factordata/panel/YYYY-MM/panel.parquet
(snappy-compressed, one partition per calendar month).  build_site.py reads the
pre-computed panel; it does not recompute factor betas inline.

JOIN CONTRACT: studies join this panel against the replay artifact
(data/replay/standout_replay.parquet) on (ticker, date) where date == signal_date.
No other program may write to data/factordata/panel/.  No panel column may be added
without a v2 version stamp.

V1 FREEZE: all Block-A, Block-B, Twin, DNA, and style_regime parameters are frozen
as of adjudication rulings 2026-07-04 (P1-A), 2026-07-05 (P1-B), 2026-07-05 (P1-C).
See research/FACTOR_INTELLIGENCE_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md §3 for the authoritative
spec.  Any parameter change requires a v2 stamp.

SCOPE (P1-A + P1-B + P1-C — see masterplan §7):
  - Block-A: per-(ticker,date) rolling attribution vs ordered orthogonal streams
  - Block-B: trailing cross-sectional percentiles of equity_factors legs
  - alpha_z_house read-through from site/factordata/alpha.json (nightly residual_alpha)
  - Panel schema + partitioning + version stamp
  - Twin computation (P1-B): twin_rel_20d, twin_bleed_flag, twin_n_peers, twin_fallback
  - DNA class cascade (P1-C, §3.3): deterministic priority-ordered first-match cascade
  - Style-regime classifier (P1-C, §3.4): 5-state market-level classifier with hysteresis

OUT OF SCOPE FOR THIS PR (added by later PRs):
  - Pair G detector / factor_attention reflex (P1-D)

DNA CLASS CASCADE (P1-C, masterplan §3.3):
  Deterministic priority-ordered first-match cascade over Block-B percentiles and
  Block-A betas.  Computed once per (ticker, date).  'mixed' is the honest default
  when no archetype triggers.  Per RULING-A: rows with None Block-B inputs (backfill
  dates per R3 NULL-backfill law) emit dna_class=None (NOT EVALUABLE).  'mixed' is
  reserved for rows that WERE evaluated and matched no archetype.

STYLE-REGIME CLASSIFIER (P1-C, masterplan §3.4):
  Market-level (one state per date); the same state is stamped on every ticker row
  for that date.  5 states: growth_momentum, quality_defense, value_cyclical,
  junk_rally, mixed.

  RULING-D (input path, 2026-07-05): site/themedata/etf_pulse.json does NOT exist
  in this repo (no such file).  site/factordata/factor_series.json 'series' is not a
  per-date time series usable for rolling 20d/60d factor returns.  chart_data/spread
  covers only ~2 years (2023-05-30 to present), below the 3y calibration target.
  THEREFORE: ratio inputs (IWF/IWD, QQQ/SPY, IWM/SPY 20d) are computed DIRECTLY
  from data/yahoo/{IWF,IWD,QQQ,SPY,IWM}.parquet close caches — these go back to
  2000 and provide deterministic PIT reconstruction.  For the factor L/S leader,
  factor_series.json chart_data/spread cumulative series (775 dates, 2023-05-30+)
  is used where available; the confirmed leader is the factor with the highest
  trailing-20d L/S compounded return, debounced with 3-session persistence (matching
  the _rotation() logic in engine/factor_series.py).  The current confirmed leader
  snapshot is also read from factor_series.json['rotation']['leader'] for the
  nightly emit.  Historical reconstruction for the 3y calibration sanity check uses
  the chart_data/spread series.

  HYSTERESIS (§3.4 frozen rule):
    - New state requires 2 consecutive daily confirmations.
    - On day 1 match: pending_{new_state} recorded; confirmed state unchanged.
    - On day 2 consecutive match: confirmed state flips.
    - Reversion to 'mixed': immediate (1 day) — no hysteresis on reversion.
    - panel column 'style_regime': confirmed state.
    - panel column 'style_regime_pending': tentative next state during hysteresis;
      null when no flip is pending or state is already confirmed.

  IDEMPOTENCE (PREREG §2.5(a)): style_regime[t] is a pure function of data ≤ t.
  The classifier processes dates in order from oldest to newest, carrying forward
  only the confirmed state and a 1-day candidate buffer — no future data can affect
  past confirmed states.  Any truncation at T and rebuild from scratch produces
  identical results for all dates ≤ T.

CALIBRATION NOTE (Fable ruling 2026-07-05):
  Calibration degeneracies (DNA mixed 52%, style mixed 89%) are PRINTED, not
  patched.  §3.3/§3.4 thresholds remain frozen v1.  A v2 recalibration is
  deferred to the pre-H3 clean window: after real fire-population distributions
  exist and before any H3 outcome data is analyzed.  mixed is the honest
  default, not a failure (§3.3).

NIGHTLY BOUNDS (RULING-C + FIX-8, 2026-07-05):
  The nightly CI step (daily.yml factor_panel) passes --start equal to 10 trading
  days back so a cold runner can never silently rebuild a full year of history.
  This bounds the CI step to ~10 rows per ticker (seconds, not minutes) and makes
  the incremental check cheaper to verify.

  ONE-SHOT DEEP BACKFILL (required once, NOT in the nightly loop):
  Before the panel has usable history depth, run the backfill manually:
      python -m scripts.build_factor_panel --start 2020-01-01 --backfill
  Expected runtime ~25 minutes (5 years × ~1500 tickers). The --backfill flag
  bypasses the incremental skip logic. See also the full example above.

NIGHTLY INCREMENTAL WIRING (RULING-C, 2026-07-05):
  The panel build runs as an INCREMENTAL step: only dates missing from existing
  monthly partitions are built.  The incremental check loads existing partition
  'date' columns and skips dates already present.  This keeps the nightly run to
  ~1-5 minutes (one day's worth of rows), well within the render window.

  ONE-SHOT DEEP BACKFILL (do NOT put in the nightly loop):
  To build the full historical panel from 2020-01-01 (required before P3 studies):
      python -m scripts.build_factor_panel \\
          --data-root /Users/chriswong/Documents/Cluade/Macro\\ Dashboard \\
          --out-root <worktree-root> \\
          --start 2020-01-01 \\
          --backfill
  Expected runtime: ~25 minutes for 5 years × ~1500 tickers.
  The --backfill flag is required to bypass the incremental skip logic.
  This command is documented here and is NOT in the nightly CI loop.

GITIGNORE STATUS: data/factordata/panel/ is gitignored (confirmed in .gitignore).
  The nightly panel step writes no tracked files — the sentinel git-add staging set
  requires no changes.  This is verified explicitly in the P1-C test suite.

TWIN COMPUTATION (P1-B — masterplan §3.5 + RULING-1 + RULING-2):

  INDUSTRY FIELD — SECTOR-PROXY DEVIATION (flagged for Fable ruling before merge):
    The masterplan §3.5 specifies twins grouped by GICS industry (sub-sector level).
    However, local caches (data/{breadth,smallcap_breadth,midcap_breadth}/constituents.parquet
    and site/factordata/factors.json) contain ONLY the 'sector' field (GICS sector
    level, 11 categories).  NO GICS industry field exists in any local cache.
    Therefore, twin grouping uses SECTOR as the proxy for industry.
    This is flagged as SECTOR-PROXY throughout the twin code and run log.
    A proper GICS industry mapping (4-digit code + label) is required to implement
    the spec as written.  That mapping must be sourced externally (e.g. EDGAR GICS
    classification files or the index provider's mapping table) and will be supplied
    in the pre-P3 follow-up that also handles per-date mktcap for historical backfill.

    FABLE RULING 2026-07-05: sector-proxy twins are display-tier v1 interim.
    PREREG H4's clock does NOT start on sector-proxy twins — H4 requires GICS-industry
    grouping (locked text).  Industry mapping (EDGAR SIC or Polygon reference) joins the
    pre-P3 follow-up; twins switch to industry grouping from the first freeze month after
    it lands, and H4 accrual starts there.

  NULL-BACKFILL (RULING-2, 2026-07-05):
    Twin columns (twin_rel_20d, twin_bleed_flag, twin_n_peers, twin_fallback) are
    computed ONLY for build dates in the CURRENT freeze month (the calendar month
    whose first-trading-day freeze uses the live factors.json mktcap snapshot for
    the size-tercile filter).  All earlier (backfill) dates receive None — same R3
    semantics as Block-B.  Historical twin backfill joins the pre-P3 follow-up that
    supplies per-date mktcap via equity_factors backtest mode.

  twin_bleed_flag definition (RULING-1, PREREG H4 governs over masterplan §3.5):
    True iff BOTH:
      (a) twin basket 20d return < 0
      (b) twin basket drawdown-from-20d-high at evaluation date t >
          median of the PRIOR 60 TRADING observations of 20d-drawdown-from-20d-high
          (the 60 rows of the drawdown series strictly before t; one observation per
          trading day, computed from twin basket daily returns up to and including t).
    The masterplan §3.5 parenthetical originally said "prior 252d"; corrected below
    to match the locked PREREG H4.

  Freeze schedule: membership is frozen on the first trading day of each calendar
    month (first_bday_of_month).  The same frozen membership is used for all
    evaluation dates in that calendar month.

  Correlation window for member selection: [freeze_date - 253, freeze_date - 1]
    (252 business days of residual returns ending the day before the freeze date).

  Minimum peers: 8 after sector + size-tercile filter.  If fewer than 8, fall back
    to sector EW (all sector members, self-excluded), twin_fallback=True.

NOTE (F3 ruling 2026-07-05): trailing-252d study breakpoints (alibi Q80, alpha_z
quintiles) are STUDY-TIME derivations from accumulated panel history — Block-A
history is price-only and PIT-backfillable via --start; no dedicated breakpoint
columns are emitted by design.

STREAM WARMUP COVERAGE (F-A disclosure 2026-07-05): the sequential causal orth
chain consumes ~127 leading rows PER STREAM, so late-priority streams have low
fill on short histories.  Measured on a 790-bday cache: beta_dollar 53.6%,
beta_ai_theme 0.2%, beta_china 0.0% non-null.  The production nightly and any
study-facing backfill must run with deep history (--start 2020-01-01 or earlier)
so all Block-A streams reach full coverage before P3 studies consume them.

PIT SEMANTICS (R3 ruling 2026-07-04):
  Block-B *_pct columns (value_pct, profitability_pct, quality_pct, payout_pct,
  low_vol_pct) and alpha_z_house are SINGLE-DAY SNAPSHOT values sourced from
  factors.json and alpha.json respectively.  Stamping them onto historical build
  dates is lookahead.  RULING: these columns are emitted ONLY for build dates
  matching the snapshot's own as_of date; all other (backfill) dates receive None.

  Historical backfill of these columns is a separate follow-up (equity_factors
  backtest mode asof=date + residual_alpha recompute) required BEFORE P3
  H3/H2-stratification runs on history.  This limitation is documented here and
  in the run log.

CAUSAL ORTHOGONALIZATION (R1 ruling 2026-07-04):
  _orthogonalize_series uses ROLLING causal coefficients (252d window, shift(1))
  rather than static full-history Gram-Schmidt.  This prevents future data from
  leaking into historical orthogonalization values.  Mirrors the convention in
  engine/residual_alpha.py _causal_beta (lines 55-58).

Usage:
    python -m scripts.build_factor_panel [--data-root PATH] [--start YYYY-MM-DD]
        [--end YYYY-MM-DD] [--tickers SYM,SYM,...] [--out-root PATH]

    --data-root   Path to the repo root whose data/ caches to read.
                  Default: the repo root this script lives in.
                  For dev sample runs: '/Users/chriswong/Documents/Cluade/Macro Dashboard'
    --start       First date to build (inclusive).  Default: 1 year back.
    --end         Last date to build (inclusive).   Default: latest available date.
    --tickers     Comma-separated subset, e.g. AAPL,MSFT.  Default: all breadth names.
    --out-root    Root under which data/factordata/panel/ is written.
                  Default: same as --data-root.

    PIT anchor (#3488 fix)
    ----------------------
    dna_class is evaluable on exactly ONE cross-section: the factors.json as_of
    date.  The R3 PIT gate in build_panel (``factors_pit_ok``) emits Block-B
    ``*_pct`` columns only on that date and NULL-backfills every other build date,
    and _classify_dna returns None when any required Block-B input is None
    (RULING-A).  The panel's *latest* date is therefore the one date that is
    systematically NOT evaluable: the nightly builds through T from the fresh
    close cache while the checked-out factors.json is still the previous night's
    (as_of = T-1).  Anchoring on ``panel["date"].max()`` published a 100%-null
    payload every night while the log cheerfully reported a healthy ticker count.

    So: anchor on the latest date that actually carries a non-null dna_class and
    report THAT date as as_of.  Consumers already treat this artifact as T-1 by
    design (engine and factor_panel are parallel siblings).

    style_regime is a market-level scalar stamped identically on every row of a
    date (build_panel §3.4), so it has zero cross-sectional variance BY DESIGN —
    that is not a degeneracy and is not guarded here.  Its timeline degeneracy is
    reported separately by _calibration_sanity_style_regime.

    Fail-soft: absent columns (pre-P1-C partitions) → per_ticker:{} + note field.
    Never raises; a null NEVER blocks the nightly (CLAUDE.md §Epistemics).

    Returns the emitted document (also written to disk).
