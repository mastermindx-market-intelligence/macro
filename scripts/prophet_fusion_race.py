"""PR-1b — the frozen, counterfactual-replay-labelled BASELINE RACE.

WHAT THIS IS.  Masterplan §8.1 rungs **G0, G0', G1, G2, G3, G4 and C1** raced against the
§7 frozen outcomes on ONE frame: the graded-board frame (§8.5 frame 2,
``data/us_board_ledger/retro_grades.parquet``).  No C2+.  No fitting.  No backfill.

WHAT THIS IS NOT.  It carries **no authority**.  §15 narrowed PR-1b to a calibration
exercise and this module stamps that into every artifact it writes: the champion has
never been graded (§6.1, N=0), so G0 here is a REPLAY of today's scorer over historical
board payloads, the frame is ``survivorship_biased: true``, and half the chartered
horizons (H=42/63) have ZERO graded rows.  ``counterfactual_replay: true`` and
``non_promotion_bearing: true`` are top-level keys of the report, not footnotes, and
the vocabulary law is enforced by a test: a rung **leads on the replay frame**; nothing
here beats, wins, or validates anything.

THE THREE THINGS THIS MODULE REFUSES TO DO
------------------------------------------
1. **Silently default a champion input.**  A date whose snapshot payload cannot be built
   REFUSES for every rung that needs it, is listed by name in ``rung_coverage``, and is
   dropped from every pairwise comparison (comparisons are PAIRED on common dates).
   Within a built date a leg's missing input resolves through *the champion's own*
   fail-closed rule (unknown extension earns 0 runway, a cleared tier earns 0 signal) —
   that is the behaviour that shipped, and it is disclosed per-leg per-date rather than
   smoothed away.
2. **Let an outcome pick a sign.**  Every C1 member's direction lives in
   :data:`REGISTERED_SIGNS` with a ``source`` string naming registry semantics, a
   producer doc, or a filed adjudication.  The rung builders are handed a frame with the
   outcome columns REMOVED (:func:`build_race_frame`), so the sign law is structural and
   not a promise.  §6.6's ore signatures are logged-not-claimed and are never a source.
3. **Manufacture a fold.**  §9.2's minimum-usable-fold rule cannot be satisfied by 24
   dates at a 21-session embargo.  The harness calls
   :func:`scripts.prophet_fusion_arena.folds_for_labels` and embeds its refusal VERBATIM.

Run::

    python3 -m scripts.prophet_fusion_race --out research/prophet_fusion/pr1b_baseline_race

The report carries no wall-clock stamp on purpose: two runs of the same CLI over the same
repo produce byte-identical JSON, which is the reproducibility receipt.  The date lives in
the companion doc and in git.
