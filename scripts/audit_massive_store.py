"""Coverage-continuity audit for the massive_stock_day whole-market OHLCV store.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-07-03 incident): the store's committed _manifest.json claimed
`latest_date: 2026-06-30` while the parquets held only 2025-01-02→2026-03-12 — a
smoke test had advanced the v1 scalar resume state past a 110-day hole, and nothing
watched the store's CONTENT.  audit_r2 checks only that a manifest object is fresh
on R2 (Last-Modified), so a store that is freshly published yet full of holes sails
through.  The Options-Alpha W1.1 agent tripped over the hole and had to route around
the store entirely.  This audit is the content-level tripwire.

FAILS ARE FOR THE INCIDENT CLASS, NOT FOR OLD HISTORY (2026-07-29).  Continuity is
judged only over the trailing cfg[massive_recent_window_bdays] business days: an
in-window hole or a lying manifest is a live defect and fails, while a large gap deeper
in history is descriptive and only FLAGS.  Why: a full-history continuity fail says
nothing about tonight's feed and aborts every full-run quality gate until the gap
closes — and the two ways a big historical gap arises are both non-incidents.  A
mid-backfill or otherwise stale resume-state snapshot reports coverage the live store
already has (2026-07-29: the committed sidecar claimed 471 days against the 1,302 the
published store actually held), and a genuine hole being chipped by the capped nightly
incremental is a known remainder shrinking on its own.  What must alarm either way is a
NEW tip-adjacent gap.

WHAT IT CHECKS — ground truth is the ANCHOR PARQUETS, never the manifest:
  FAIL (counts toward the collect.py governance gate, aborts at >5% of the universe):
    - an anchor ticker (SPY/QQQ/AAPL/MSFT/IWM — maximally liquid, trade every US
      session) is missing from the store or unreadable;
    - CONTINUITY (IN-WINDOW): an anchor has a run of more than
      cfg[massive_max_gap_bdays] consecutive missing BUSINESS days between bars within
      the trailing window (holidays cost 1-2; the default of 5 = a full missing week;
      the incident hole was ~75).  Anchor continuity is equivalent to whole-store day
      continuity because each day is fetched as ONE whole-market file — a day missing
      from SPY is a day missing from everyone.
    - MANIFEST LIE: _manifest.json `latest_date` is more than
      cfg[massive_manifest_ahead_bdays] business days AHEAD of what the anchors
      actually hold — freshness claims the data cannot back (the incident signature).
  FLAG (logged, never fatal — suite convention: staleness is a flag):
    - the newest anchor bar is more than cfg[massive_stale_bdays] business days old;
    - a worst-gap older than the window, reported with its size so deep history stays
      visible rather than silently excused;
    - _manifest.json absent/unparsable while parquets exist.

SKIP: a checkout without the parquet store (fewer than cfg[massive_min_files] files
— e.g. a collect job whose R2 restore failed) is skipped entirely, never a failure —
matching the audit_prices convention that an absent backing store never aborts a
build.  On the nightly lane that skip is itself annotated: there, an absent store
means the restore did not work and the store did not advance.

Deterministic, READ-ONLY over the store; writes only data/quality/massive_store_audit.json.
Wired into scripts/collect.py run_quality_audits alongside prices/macro/universe, AND
run as its own non-fatal daily.yml collect step — the nightly lane passes
--exclude-group asia, which makes collect.py skip the whole quality gate as a partial
run, so this audit had ZERO nightly coverage through the 2026-07 freeze.  Exits 1 when
a member failed (content fail); stale flags and skips exit 0.
