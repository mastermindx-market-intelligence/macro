"""scripts/prophet_board_acceptance.py — post-publish acceptance alarm for one
engine-job nightly run.

PR-1 of the Prophet US permanence net (ROUTE: build commission,
research/PROPHET_US_PERMANENCE_NET_2026-08-27.md). An opus red-team of the
first design found that every existing watchdog (freshness_sentinel,
check_nightly_liveness, prophet_rescue) grades the estate from OUTSIDE the
run that produced it — after the fact, on a later cadence. None of them can
say "this run's own board is internally consistent" AT THE MOMENT it was
written, with the run's own on-disk bytes still in front of it. This script
closes that gap: it runs as the LAST prophet-owned step of the ENGINE job in
.github/workflows/daily.yml, immediately after the "Prophet nightly" step and
BEFORE "checkpoint Prophet outputs to main" — same job, same runner, same
files, so there is no cross-job pull race and no window where a later reader
could see something this check did not.

WHAT IT ASSERTS, for the session this run is producing (expected_last_session
against the clock the run started with):
  * IF ``index.intake.originated`` says this run originated any new plan,
    an immutable receipt exists for THIS run id AND attempt at
    data/prophet/origination_receipts/<run_id>-<run_attempt>-*.json. A retry
    may carry an existing non-empty market-session cohort while originating
    ZERO new IDs; the producer then legitimately writes NO receipt
    (``if not new_ids: raise SystemExit(0)``), so cohort membership is never
    used as receipt-obligation authority.
  * The intake identity holds: intake.lossless is True, intake.unaccounted
    == 0, and NOT (intake.eligible_after_skips > 0 AND intake.originated ==
    0). This is the SAME predicate scripts/freshness_sentinel.py,
    scripts/check_nightly_liveness.py, and scripts/prophet_rescue.py each
    carry independently — deliberately duplicated, never imported from one
    shared module, so a bug in one instrument's copy cannot blind the other
    three at once (see their own docstrings on failure-domain independence).
  * site/factordata/us_standouts.json's ``as_of`` equals both the expected
    session AND its own ``staleness.price_through`` — the same re-stamp trap
    freshness_sentinel's module docstring documents at length: a rerun over
    frozen inputs can re-stamp a publication clock green while the priced
    watermark stays behind.
  * every site/prophet/index.json plan belonging to this market session
    (``price_basis_date``, then ``entry_date``, then legacy per-plan
    ``recorded_at``) has its site/prophet/plans/<id>.json file present on disk.
  * every plan this run's receipt(s) say it newly originated carries a
    ``recorded_at`` stamp on disk.

HONEST SCOPE — read this before treating a green run as proof of more than it
is:
  * This is an ALARM AFTER PUBLISH, never a GATE. A failure here prints one
    ``::error`` annotation, pushes one ops alert, and exits nonzero — it does
    not and must never block the engine job's downstream steps or the
    nightly's site publish (see the caller step's own comment in daily.yml).
    Its job is to make a broken board LOUD on the GitHub failure domain the
    same night it breaks, closing the "everything green, board frozen" blind
    spot the August 2026 27-day freeze exposed.
  * It is a correct, honest NO-OP on a night the engine job never runs at all
    (a DST/weekend no-op skip) — nothing was owed, so there is nothing to
    check.
  * It is DEAD if the run is cancelled or wedged before this step ever
    starts. That failure class — a run that never concludes, is
    force-cancelled, or hangs — is covered by scripts/check_nightly_liveness.py
    (checks A/B) and scripts/prophet_rescue.py's wedge/strand logic, not by
    this script; a script that only runs inside a job cannot observe the job
    never finishing.
  * Under ``workflow_dispatch`` (a manual re-run, not the scheduled nightly)
    it additionally prints a line-start ``::warning`` noting that the
    schedule-only B1 candidate-episode reconcile step is skipped this run.
    That is informational only — this script does not touch and has no
    opinion on that step's trigger, which the V4 program owns.
