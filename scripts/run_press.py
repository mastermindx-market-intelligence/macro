"""scripts/run_press.py — Media Network W1 (docket D14) press orchestrator.

Two modes, and the default is the safe one:

    python -m scripts.run_press                 # --staging (default)
    python -m scripts.run_press --staging       # plan -> write -> validate
    python -m scripts.run_press --emit          # publish what already passed

--staging  Plans slots, writes drafts, runs the whole deterministic validator
           suite, and writes one JSON per slot (draft + validator_report +
           attempt history) to data/press/staging/.  It writes NOTHING under
           content/ or site/.  That is a tested invariant, not a convention:
           tests/test_press_run.py::test_staging_writes_nothing_outside_staging
           snapshots the tree and fails on any other write.

--emit     Takes the staged items whose status is `passed`, writes
           content/seo/blog/<slug>.md, renders the estate with the EXISTING
           free-content builder, copies the /blog/ subtree (pages + feed.xml)
           into site/, and appends one row per piece to
           data/press/published.jsonl.

           site/sitemap.xml is NEVER written here — the nightly owns it.
           Only site/blog/** is copied out of the render, so this lane cannot
           clobber the learn/tools/calculator pages the render lanes own.

W1.5 EMIT ROUTING (config/press.yml `cutover`).  Each passing draft is routed by
its DESK's publication:

  cutover: false (today)   every desk keeps the path above, byte for byte.  The
                           property trees still get built by
                           scripts/build_press_properties.py, but nothing about
                           this lane's writes changes.
  cutover: true            a publication that carries `property_tree` takes its
                           own road: the .md goes to that publication's
                           content_dir (NOT content/seo/blog), the free-content
                           estate render is SKIPPED for it entirely, and its
                           property tree is re-rendered from the ledger.

Both branches now write `url` and `title` on the ledger row.  That is what makes
the cutover migration-free: a row states where IT was published, so pre-cutover
rows keep pointing at /blog/ forever and no historic row is ever rewritten.  The
ledger is append-only and every consumer reads it with .get(), so rows written
before this change (which carry neither field) stay readable.

DELTA VS W1 (declared, not incidental): the ledger row's `publication` now comes
from the DESK's config entry at emit time, not from the staged record's copy of
it.  W1 read `obj["publication"]`, which was written when the draft was STAGED —
so re-pointing a desk to another publication between staging and emit published
the piece under the new routing while recording the old name.  The staged value
remains the fallback for a desk that has since been deleted from config.

QUARANTINE FLOW: fail -> regenerate (<= quarantine.max_regenerations) -> drop
the slot with a logged reason.  A thin day beats a padded one, so a dropped
slot is a normal outcome and exits 0.

The render replay is the non-obvious part of --emit.  The committed estate is
NOT the builder's raw output — the render lanes run idempotent sweeps over
site/ afterwards (externalize_css, optimize_assets), and
`build_free_content --check` replays those sweeps before comparing.  So an emit
that committed raw builder output would turn the estate drift check red on the
very next PR.  This replays the same sweeps, through the same helpers --check
uses, so what lands in site/blog/ is the post-sweep image --check expects.

    Selection and source-revision reconciliation deliberately live outside this
    helper.  The ordinary Press run supplies both; a future immutable ingress
    can supply one already-verified candidate without calling either mutable
    discovery surface.  ``admission_receipt`` is copied into the stage record
    solely as provenance — it never changes validation, status, retry, or emit
    behaviour.
