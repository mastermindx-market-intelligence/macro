"""Finish the #4807 session-stamp migration on the 91% of the store it never reached.

WHAT WENT WRONG.  ``scripts/migrate_polygon_gex_session_stamps.py`` (#4807, merged
fc7ad1a6a95) re-stamped polygon_gex from the UTC run date to the NYSE session each
snapshot describes.  It ran correctly and its commit message reports the store it
produced: "418 -> 392 summary files, 8,062 rows, ZERO non-session stamps".  That store
was never committed.  What landed was 36 rewritten summary files out of 419.

The mechanism is a data-file merge collision, not a logic bug:

  * the migration rewrote all 419 summary files on its branch;
  * ``data: daily collection 2026-08-07`` (1fc6d1181e4) landed on main FIRST and appended
    an 08-07 row to exactly the 372 summary files in that night's universe;
  * merging #4807 resolved those 372 files in favour of main's newer daily-collection
    copy, silently reverting the migration on every one of them.

The 372 reverted files are *identical* to the 372 underlyings in
``chains/2026-08-07.parquet`` -- 372 of 372, zero difference.  Only the 36 files the
nightly had not touched kept the migration's rewrite.  #4807 was merged at 07:30Z with
ci-pack-0..3 all still PENDING, so the guard it shipped
(``tests/test_options_session_guards.py``) never concluded on its head and the revert
shipped unseen.

The surviving weekend rows are therefore the ORIGINAL pre-migration UTC run-date
artifacts, not new mis-mappings: ``summary_AAL.parquet`` and ``summary_AAPL.parquet`` are
byte-identical at fc7ad1a6a95 and its parent.  Nothing about #4807's session resolution
is wrong; it was applied to 9% of the store.

WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE SCRIPT.  The original migration cannot simply be re-run.
``build_plan()`` recovers each chains file's accrual instant with ``_git_last_touch``, and
the migration commit rewrote those files -- so every kept chains file now reports the
MIGRATION's timestamp instead of its accrual, and all 24 would resolve to one session.
The commit message says as much: the instants are "frozen into the manifest; the
migration commit makes them unrecoverable".  ``docs/polygon_gex_session_stamp_migration.json``
is that frozen record and is the authority used here.

THE REMAP IS NOT IDEMPOTENT -- the central hazard.  12 of the 24 resolved sessions are
also remap KEYS with a non-identity mapping (2026-07-01, -07-02, -07-08, -07-09, -07-10,
-07-21, -07-22, -07-23, -07-24, -07-28, -07-29, -07-30), and 7 more resolved sessions
fall inside the DROP set (2026-06-18, -06-26, -06-30, -07-07, -07-13, -07-20, -07-27).
Applying the remap a second time to an already-migrated file would re-date good rows and
delete others.  This script therefore partitions the store and touches ONLY the files
that still carry original stamps, then asserts the partition against git.

ONE FILE POSTDATES THE MANIFEST.  ``chains/2026-08-07.parquet`` arrived with the nightly
that caused the collision, written by the OLD run-date writer (the #4807 fix had not
merged yet).  It is still git-recoverable -- the migration never touched it -- so it is
resolved with the migration's OWN machinery rather than by hand:

    accrual instant 2026-08-07T04:06:20Z = 2026-08-07 00:06 ET, i.e. after the 08-06
    close -> expected_last_session = 2026-08-06
    cross-section vs 08-06: CLEAN, median error 0.0000%, 100.0% exact to the cent,
                            283 checkable underlyings of 372
    cross-section vs 08-07: 0 checkable (that close does not exist yet)

So 2026-08-07 -> 2026-08-06, and session 08-06 is recovered rather than dropped.  There
is no collision: the original ``chains/2026-08-06.parquet`` was quarantined and removed
by #4807 (a 05:57 ET pre-open accrual, 40.8% exact), which is why 08-05 stands as an
honest gap.

RESULT: 408 summary files, 13,340 -> 8,434 rows, 25 sessions, zero non-session stamps.
(8,062 is #4807's own figure for the 42-file manifest; the extra 372 rows are the 08-06
session this script recovers.)
