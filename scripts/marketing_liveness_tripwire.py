"""scripts/marketing_liveness_tripwire.py — the alarm a dead publisher cannot duck.

THE INCIDENT IT EXISTS FOR (2026-08-06 → 2026-08-10, five days).
On 08-06 Buffer's plan locked and every send came back 429. On 08-08 the repo
VARIABLE ``MARKETING_PUBLISH_ENABLED`` was set to ``0`` — the correct move while
the backend was refusing. Buffer was then fixed and NOBODY RE-ARMED IT. For the
next five days the 30-minute ladder ran on schedule, concluded GREEN on every
sweep, and posted nothing at all.

Two silence bugs made that possible, and this module is the answer to the second:

  1. The publisher's disarmed downgrade only spoke through ``log.warning``. House
     law (CLAUDE.md, "GitHub annotations must START the line") is precisely about
     this: every builder here logs with a prefixing format, so a ``::warning``
     handed to a logger emits ``WARNING ::warning …`` and GitHub drops it. The
     Actions UI therefore showed NOTHING while the lane self-downgraded on all
     ~30 sweeps a day. Fixed at the source in scripts/marketing_publisher.py.
  2. NOTHING EVER ALARMED ON "no post in N hours". A dry-run sweep is a
     successful sweep; a green check meant the workflow ran, never that the
     product shipped. Absence of output had no observer. That is this file.

WHAT IT DOES. Reads two facts — the arm variable and the newest live receipt in
``data/marketing/publications.jsonl`` — and turns "the account has been quiet too
long" into a GitHub annotation and, when it matters, a non-zero exit that reds
the sweep.

    ARMED, deep in the posting window, no live post in stale_post_alarm_hours
        → ::error, exit 1. Armed and silent is an outage, full stop.
    DISARMED longer than disarmed_alarm_hours
        → ::warning on EVERY sweep, and once a day (13:00Z, the slot the
          workflow already reserves for the metrics poll) an ::error and exit 1.
          A kill-switch left off is a decision that has to be re-made out loud;
          the daily red is what stops "temporarily dark" from becoming five days.
    otherwise
        → one ::notice with the age, so a healthy lane still prints its proof.

The armed rule only fires inside [17:00Z..23:59Z] ∪ [00:00Z..00:30Z]. The ladder
posts 11:00Z–00:30Z (4:00 AM–5:30 PM PT); at 11:30Z "nothing since yesterday
afternoon" is the normal overnight gap, and an alarm that cries every morning is
an alarm nobody reads. By 17:00Z the day is deep enough in the window that
silence means something.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It never posts, never approves, never selects,
never writes a ledger and never touches the outbox. It reads two files and
prints. It is wired as the LAST step of marketing-publish.yml, after the ledger
commit, with ``always()`` — a run that failed earlier is exactly the run whose
silence needs reporting, and a red tripwire must never be able to cost the ledger
a commit.

    python -m scripts.marketing_liveness_tripwire
    python -m scripts.marketing_liveness_tripwire --now 2026-08-10T20:00:00Z --root /tmp/x

EVERY annotation below is a bare ``print(..., flush=True)`` starting its line.
Never route one through ``log``: it would vanish, which is the exact defect this
module was built to end (guarded by tests/test_gh_annotation_line_start.py;
``flush`` is load-bearing because stdout is block-buffered when piped in CI).
