"""Fetch the baskets-only DEEP close store the thematic baskets render over.

The thematic baskets (engine/baskets.py) read the FREE breadth price caches. Two gaps make
those caches insufficient on their own:

  1. OFF-INDEX members — on-thesis names outside the S&P-1500 universe (recent IPOs like
     Circle/CRCL, Cerebras/CBRS, CoreWeave/CRWV, Arm/ARM, Astera/ALAB; the nuclear leg
     Oklo/NuScale/Centrus; the crypto-equity cohort MicroStrategy/Riot/Galaxy). Adding them
     to the breadth constituent lists would silently pollute the S&P-1500 breadth/factor
     universe the rest of the dashboard depends on.
  2. SHALLOW history — the large-cap breadth cache is a ~15-month ROLLING window (it only needs
     enough tape for 200DMA / NH-NL). So a large-cap-heavy basket (mag7, defensives, …) would
     render only a ~15-month stub and flag every member `partial`, even though full history is
     freely available from yfinance.

So we keep a SEPARATE, baskets-only DEEP close cache and let engine.baskets PREFER it:

    data/baskets/extras.parquet     wide [Date x TICKER] close matrix, deep (~3y) history
    data/yahoo/IBIT.parquet etc.    ETF proxies a basket references but the site doesn't track

engine.baskets.compute_baskets() combine_first's this store over the shallow breadth columns,
so every basket resolves a deep series and off-index members resolve at all. The free-S&P-1500
invariant elsewhere is untouched (this store is read by baskets only).

The fetch list is DERIVED, not hard-coded: every membership ticker that the mid/small-cap caches
do NOT already hold deeply is fetched here (large-caps + off-index) — so the store self-maintains
as membership.json evolves. Members already deep in the mid/small-cap caches are left to those.

Keyless (yfinance), batched. Additive and non-fatal: the fresh pull is MERGED onto the prior
store (prior fills any column the pull missed), so a flaky day can never drop a member or break
the daily build.
