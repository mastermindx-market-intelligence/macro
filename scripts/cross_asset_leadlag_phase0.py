"""Cross-asset lead/lag — Phase-0 honesty gate.

Daily lead/lag is notoriously unstable and inflates t-stats on overlapping
windows, so before the Cross-Asset page shows an "X leads Y" read this checks, on
the full keyless cross-asset history, which ordered lead/lag links:

  - survive a Newey-West (HAC) t-stat + Benjamini-Hochberg FDR across ALL ordered
    pairs x lags on the full sample, AND
  - hold their SIGN and clear conventional significance (|HAC t| >= 2) in BOTH
    independent halves of history (a split-half out-of-sample check).

The honest expectation: the only robust links are the mechanical TIMEZONE ones —
the US/global close leading the next Asia session by ~1 day. That is genuine
transmission worth surfacing, but it is a regime/transmission gauge, NOT a
tradeable hedge ratio. Anything that survives the full sample but fails split-half
is regime-dependent noise dressed as causality.
