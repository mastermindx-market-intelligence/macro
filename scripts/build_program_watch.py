"""Emit the biopharma seasonality program watch — WHEN to check in, and with WHAT.

Writes ``data/seasonality/program_watch.json``: four tripwires read from real
repo state, each carrying the exact prompt to paste back when it fires, and each
distinguishing "checked, not yet" from "could not check".

Two properties this file exists to hold:

* **Idempotent.**  Two runs over identical inputs produce byte-identical JSON.
  The engine takes ``asof`` as an explicit argument and reads no clock, so the
  only clock read in the whole lane is the ``--asof`` default below — resolved
  exactly the way the sibling ``build_seasonality_shadow_state`` resolves it
  (the covered set's own ``as_of``, falling back to the UTC date).  The file is
  written tmp + ``os.replace`` so a reader never sees a half-written artifact.
* **Annotations that actually appear.**  Every FIRED tripwire is printed as a
  bare ``print("::notice ...", flush=True)``.  House law, guarded repo-wide by
  ``tests/test_gh_annotation_line_start.py``: every builder here logs with a
  prefixing format, so ``log.info("::notice ...")`` emits ``INFO ::notice ...``
  and GitHub silently drops it — the call reviews as an alarm, runs clean, and
  produces nothing in the Actions summary.  ``flush`` is load-bearing because
  stdout is block-buffered when piped in Actions.

Nothing this writes is user-facing.  ``site/measurement.html`` renders ONE fact
derived from the same ledger counts (windows on the record, windows graded) and
nothing else: the prompts, doc paths, and module names here are private-channel
content and a leak of any of them onto a ``site/`` page is a defect.

Fail-open: a watch must never take the nightly down.  ``main`` returns 0
unconditionally.
