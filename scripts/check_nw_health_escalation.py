"""M3 escalation organ — persistent Neural Web health degradation detector.

Reads data/neuralweb/health.json and data/neuralweb/nw_health_run_history.jsonl.
When a breach streak (consecutive degraded NIGHTLY RUNS) reaches >=3 nights,
dispatches an ops alert via engine/alert_triage.push_ops_alert through the
nw_health lane.

Design principles (house laws):
 - Streak keyed by NIGHTLY RUN DATE (health.produced_at), NOT by data-vintage
   (health.as_of).  When upstream data is stale, as_of freezes across many
   consecutive nights; the old daily_brief_history upsert-by-as_of approach
   collapsed N degraded nights to a single row (streak=1).  The run history
   file (nw_health_run_history.jsonl) is APPEND-only: one new row per nightly
   run, keyed by produced_at date.
 - Adjacency guard: streak requires calendar-consecutive run dates (each date
   must be exactly the prior date minus one day).  Gap-separated old degraded
   records never contribute to the current streak.
 - Fail-open: any read/parse failure degrades gracefully; exit 0 always.
 - Dispatch-always invariant: push_ops_alert is dispatch-always for ops
   lanes (W6b spine). Nightly while breached (pressure is intentional).
 - Maintenance vocabulary only: no trading verbs in composed messages.
 - Article 2: ops-tier alerting via ratified W6b spine only.

Run after build_neuralweb_health in the ENGINE job (daily.yml).
