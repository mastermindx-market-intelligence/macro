"""Before/after board comparison for the 2026-08-15 fusion override — the ACCEPTANCE surface.

WHAT THIS IS FOR.  The Chairman override replaced the US board's rank authority without
waiting for forward outcomes, so the immediate acceptance question is not "does it
predict" — no H10/H21/H63 evidence exists yet and none is claimed — but "is this a
materially more compelling list of stocks".  Answering that needs the two orders side by
side over the SAME board, with the reason each name moved written out.  This produces
exactly that, deterministically, from the committed artifact.

WHAT IT IS NOT.  Not a backtest, not a promotion gate, and not evidence of forward alpha.
It re-ranks ONE frozen board.  A name that rises here rose because the evidence families
voted for it, which is a statement about breadth of present evidence and nothing else.

IT ALSO PROVES THE FREEZE.  The retired v2 scorer is re-run through
``us_board_rank.legacy_v2_values`` over the same rows and checked against the score the
artifact PUBLISHED.  A byte-exact reproduction is what makes the shadow a shadow: if the
frozen scorer did not reproduce what shipped, the "old" column of this comparison would
be a comparison against nothing (the same failure mode ``prophet_fusion_race``'s replay
gate exists to catch).  A mismatch is a hard failure, not a warning.
