"""Prophet US availability RESCUE lane — bounded self-heal, alerting, edge coverage.

DIVISION OF LABOUR (read this before adding anything here).

  scripts/check_nightly_liveness.py  DETECTS.  It is a red-check dead-man switch over
      daily.yml: run created (A), run concluded (B), source_asof advanced (C), with
      blind -> INDETERMINATE discipline.  It has NO side effects: its product is a
      failing check and a push notification.
  scripts/prophet_rescue.py (this)   RESPONDS.  It re-arms the nightly within bounds,
      opens/updates one public issue per stranded session with a receipt per wake,
      pushes to the ops channel, and additionally covers two failure shapes the
      detector does not model: a PUBLISH LAG (main fresh, the public R2 health
      receipt or the VPS pull loop stale — DEC:B1-PROPHET-PUBLIC-SPLIT: users are
      served by the protected origin, never by the R2 receipt, so a lagging receipt
      is a publish-leg defect, not a user-visible split) and the ZERO-ORIGINATION
      WEDGE (source_asof fresh, plans for the expected session absent while intake
      says candidates were eligible).

The overlap in staleness arithmetic between the two is DELIBERATE.  A responder that
imports its detector shares its fate; on 2026-08-11 the thing that broke was a single
file crossing a size cap, and two organs wired into one module would have gone dark
together.  Once #5487 is on main a follow-up may import the shared primitives
(``check_nightly_liveness.expected_fire_after`` / ``_parse_dt`` / ``_parse_date`` /
``fetch_runs``) if and only if the import stays optional with a local fallback.

WHAT BROKE (2026-08-11 -> 08-13, receipts in research/PROPHET_US_AVAILABILITY_HARDENING_2026-08-14.md).
  * 08-11: #5362 pushed daily.yml past GitHub's silent ~512,000-byte workflow
    processing cap 57 minutes before the 22:30Z cron.  The cron never fired.  Four
    manual dispatches queued jobless forever.  Zero plans originated that night.
  * 08-12 daytime: a live fleet session force-cancelled six recovery dispatches
    (receipt: POST /actions/runs/31583415065/force-cancel).
  * Nothing alarmed for two full sessions.  ``index.json.asof`` is ``date.today()``
    at bake time, so it re-stamps itself green over frozen inputs; healthcheck.py is
    a 96-hour instrument running ON the host it watches; check_dead_cron only
    inspects run records that EXIST, and a no-fire night creates none.  A cancelled
    bake and a bake that never fired leave the same trace: nothing.

ARCHITECTURE.  A thin fetch layer snapshots four independent sources into a
``WatchdogState``; a PURE ``decide(state) -> list[Action]`` turns that snapshot into
actions; a thin action layer executes them.  ``decide`` reads no clock and opens no
socket — ``state.now`` is injected — so every behavioural gate below is pinned by a
unit test in tests/test_prophet_rescue.py rather than by prose.

SAFETY INVARIANTS (masterplan §0.4; each one mutation-pinned by a named test).
  a. NEVER dispatch while a daily.yml run is queued / in_progress / waiting —
     UNLESS that run is provably WEDGED (2026-08-17 amendment, ``wedged_run``):
     old enough that no healthy bake explains it AND its jobs read shows zero
     jobs in progress with every live job queued beyond any plausible runner
     wait.  The 08-16/17 outage is why: collect_tail sat queued on a runs-on
     label carried by NO live runner, GitHub holds such a run 'alive' ~24h until
     its queued-job kill, and this invariant read the hostage as a live bake and
     refused to dispatch for two days while every Prophet board froze.  The
     wedge verdict is FAIL-CLOSED: an unreadable jobs list, an unparseable
     created_at, a fresh run, or any single in-progress job keeps the full
     refusal.  A wrong WEDGED call costs at worst a budgeted double-bake —
     the failure mode daily.yml's own concurrency comment declares acceptable
     ("a double-run, never a zero-run"); a wrong ALIVE call cost four days.
  b. NEVER exceed the auto-dispatch budget: 2 workflow_dispatch daily.yml runs since
     21:00Z today, counted across ALL actors (a human recovering by hand consumes it).
  c. NEVER cancel anything.  There is no cancel code path in this file and
     ``test_no_cancel_code_path_exists`` fails the build if one appears.  A kill is
     invisible to every staleness instrument we own; killing a wedged production run
     is an operator call.
  d. A GitHub read failure means NO DISPATCH.  Blind fails toward alerting, never
     toward blind re-arming.

REST BUDGET — TWO DIFFERENT POOLS, do not conflate them.  In the Actions lane the
`GITHUB_TOKEN` draws the per-repository 1,000/hr installation pool, which is this
lane's own and cannot starve a session.  The launchd lane borrows `gh auth token`,
so it spends the fleet's SHARED 5,000/hr account bucket — the one `ship_loop_guard.py`
fails closed without — which is why the host lane wakes twice a day rather than
hourly.  Either way: a healthy wake spends exactly THREE GitHub reads (index
contents, run list, dispatch-budget probe) plus two non-GitHub GETs (R2, VPS).  An
ALARM wake spends three more reads (R5, corrected 2026-08-27 — this paragraph had
drifted from the function docstring it is meant to summarize): the open-issue list
and this session's own comment thread, for the attempt ledger and the
duplicate-alert check, plus the preceding session's own comment thread for the
[DAY N] chain (``fetch_issue_thread`` / ``ANCHOR_CHAIN_MAX_SESSIONS``) — plus its
writes.  No pagination, ever.

EXIT CODE.  0 when nothing was done and nothing is owed (HEALTHY / WAIT).  Nonzero
when this lane ALERTED or DISPATCHED, so a red run is itself the signal.

#: lane itself misses a night (its own docstring above records daily.yml's cron
#: silently never firing — watchdog outages correlate with the outages they
#: watch) or the wake was ``--dry-run`` or its alarm never went loud, so no
#: issue was ever filed for that session; (b) an operator closes yesterday's
#: now-duplicate issue as superseded mid-outage — the most natural triage act
#: there is, and NOT the "declared-resolved" reset this ladder intends. ``2`` is
#: the number, not merely a round one: it absorbs exactly ONE missing link
#: while still refusing BOTH shapes the previous round fixed — an orphan issue
#: is many sessions back, and a Monday+Friday pair is FOUR sessions apart (from

    WHY THE PRECEDING SESSIONS, NOT EVERY OPEN SIBLING (2026-08-27 rewrite). The
    prior shape mined every OPEN ``prophet-outage`` issue and took the earliest
    anchor per breach class across all of them — that measures "the oldest open
    issue that ever mentioned this class", not "successive days", which is not
    what this ladder means. Two concrete shapes broke because of it. THE ORPHAN:
    a `prophet-outage` issue left open from an unrelated, already-resolved
    outage (or one that predates this feature and was never given an
    ``OUTAGE-DAY`` token) shares no relationship with tonight's breach at all,
    yet the old bootstrap adopted its ``created_at`` as an anchor and inflated a
    brand-new breach's day count — production has four such issues open right
    now (#5920, #6145, #6366, #6495), and a fresh STALE breach would have mined
    #5920's 2026-08-19 ``created_at`` and opened tonight's issue already reading
    "[DAY 10]"/"unbroken since 2026-08-19", both false. THE MON+FRI GAP: a bad
    Monday, a healthy Tue/Wed/Thu, and a bad Friday is two SEPARATE one-day
    outages that happen to share a verdict name; sibling mining chained them
    into a fictitious 5-day streak with no actual unbroken run of bad nights.
    Chaining through the sessions immediately before this one fixes both at
    once, but a STRICT one-link chain (only ``session_n_back(session, 1)``)
    turned out to snap on inputs that are not healed nights either: a missed
    watchdog wake (no issue ever filed for the adjacent session) or an
    operator closing yesterday's now-duplicate issue as superseded mid-outage
    (the most natural triage act there is). R1+R2 (2026-08-27 review round 2):
    walk k = 1..``ANCHOR_CHAIN_MAX_SESSIONS`` and mine the FIRST predecessor
    session that still has an open issue on this page, mining at most ONE such
    predecessor. ``ANCHOR_CHAIN_MAX_SESSIONS`` is picked so this cannot
    resurrect either killed shape: an orphan is many sessions back and a
    Mon+Fri pair is FOUR sessions apart, both unreachable at k<=2, while a
    genuine N-day outage still chains through every session because each
    day's issue links to the day directly before it.

    Up to THREE reads, spent ONLY on the alarm path — the enrichment pass in
    ``main`` runs this after a provisional ``decide`` has already said
    something is wrong, so a healthy wake never pays for any of them, and
    nothing here is ever paginated. Read 1, ``fetch_open_outage_issues``,
    answers both the session-issue match and every candidate predecessor match
    from one payload — walking k up to ``ANCHOR_CHAIN_MAX_SESSIONS`` costs
    nothing extra in reads, it only changes which row (if any) is picked from
    the same list. If a preceding-session row is found, read 2 fetches ITS
    comments — not just its body — because a night's issue BODY is only its
    FIRST receipt: when the dispatch creates a run, a LATER wake's verdict
    class (e.g. STALE, discovered only at the 09:40Z wake after the 01:40Z
    STRAND-class body) shows up ONLY in a comment, and body-only mining can
    never carry that class across days. A failure of read 2 degrades to the
    preceding row's body alone rather than raising (R4: that degradation is now
    ALSO reported with a bare ``::warning``, naming the issue and the error,
    because losing a comment-only class silently means the day count may read
    low with nothing in the run log to explain why). THIS session's own row,
    if it exists, still gets its own comments read (read 3) exactly as before,
    and that read is still what produces ``receipts``/``last_verdicts`` — a
    failure of the PRECEDING session's read never touches those two fields,
    it can only degrade ``anchors``.
