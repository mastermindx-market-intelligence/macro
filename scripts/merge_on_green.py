"""Squash-merge pull requests labeled `merge-on-green` once their checks conclude.

WHY THIS EXISTS (operator ruling 2026-07-28, "can you actually fix this").
The merge-on-CONCLUDED-checks law is correct — a pending check is not a pass, and
an `--admin` merge mid-flight used to cancel the PR's own proof run (#3867) — but
it turned every session into a CI hostage, holding its turn 20-60 minutes purely
to watch packs it cannot influence.

Every GitHub-native fix is structurally unavailable on this account:

  * A user-account ruleset cannot grant the github-actions app a bypass (422,
    organization-only), so the lanes cannot be exempted from a rule.
  * ANY required-status-check rule — ruleset or classic branch protection — would
    also block the render/nightly lanes' direct `GITHUB_TOKEN` pushes to main,
    breaking the deploy path to fix the merge path.
  * `gh pr merge --auto --squash` is not a wait at all: with no branch protection
    there are no required checks to gate on, so auto-merge merges IMMEDIATELY
    (verified PR #3889, 2026-07-28 — merged ~1 min after arming, packs pending).

So the release valve is account-side: a session arms its PR with the
`merge-on-green` label and stops; this sweeper wakes when `ci`, `fences`, or the
source-main `integration-baseline` concludes, with a ten-minute cron retained as
a recovery net. It performs the merge the session would otherwise have sat there
waiting to perform. The discipline is unchanged — nothing merges until every
check has CONCLUDED clean — only the waiting moved off the session.

Two 2026-08-13 additions, both measured against the live jam rather than the
2026-08-11 hosted-pool comments:

  * A baseline whose TESTS never ran (checkout/action-download timeout) is
    skipped the same way ``cancelled`` already is — it is no information about
    main. Latching those flakes as ``red`` paused every ordinary merge with
    zero ``main-red-repair`` PRs in the queue.
  * A pull request whose only red ``ci-pack-*`` / ``ci-gate`` names (and whose
    failed legacy jobs, parsed from check-run annotations) are a subset of
    what main is currently failing, and which did not touch a CI global
    invalidator, is a LIVE inherited red: merge it. The healed-main refresh
    path still owns the case where main has since gone green.

MAIN-RED CIRCUIT BREAKER. PR checks prove a head against the base GitHub gave it;
they do not prove that the rapidly moving source main remains healthy after later
merges. `integration-baseline.yml` publishes one fast verdict for each source or
control-plane descendant on main. This sweeper reads the latest run before it
looks at PRs. Pending, red, missing, or non-ancestral baseline evidence pauses
ordinary merges. Exactly one explicitly labelled `main-red-repair` PR may be
considered per sweep, and it still needs every one of its own checks green. That
is the escape hatch which prevents a circuit breaker from deadlocking its repair.

TOKENS. Reads use `READ_TOKEN` (in Actions the job's own `GITHUB_TOKEN`, whose
per-repository quota is separate from the shared account pool that
`ship_loop_guard.py` and every parallel session draw on — a 10-minute sweep must
not spend the budget those depend on). Writes use `MERGE_TOKEN`, an
`ADMIN_GH_TOKEN` PAT when present, because a merge performed with `GITHUB_TOKEN`
does not fire push-triggered workflows: render.yml would never see the sweeper's
merge. On the `GITHUB_TOKEN` fallback the merge still lands and the VPS's 3-minute
pull plus the nightly `scope=all` re-render still deliver it — degraded, not
broken.

STALE BASES. A clean head whose merge GitHub refuses is not automatically a
human's problem. main takes ~19 commits in 3 hours here while a pack run takes
~30 minutes, so a pull request routinely goes green and is stale before its own
proof finishes. That used to end at `merge-blocked`, waiting for someone to
rebase by hand — which is how a one-hour-old pull request becomes a three-day-old
one. The sweeper now asks GitHub to merge main into the head itself
(`update-branch`); if GitHub declines, the conflict is real and the label is
applied exactly as before. The merge gate is unchanged: an updated head is
UNPROVEN until its fresh checks conclude, and a later sweep judges it on those.

REDUNDANT FULL SWEEPS ARE COALESCED (2026-08-11). The old workflow-wide constant
group did not serialise WORK — it serialised the 25-107 minute wait for a shared
GitHub-hosted runner while triggers arrived every ~50 seconds, yielding 0
successful sweeps in 100 runs. The job now has a dedicated runner and a job-level
group: success/schedule/dispatch events share one level-triggered `sweep`, while
failure marker passes are keyed by head SHA so different reds cannot swallow one
another. The full measurement is in .github/workflows/merge-on-green.yml.

This remains a LEVEL-TRIGGERED RECONCILER: every full run re-lists the labeled
pull requests and re-derives every verdict from GitHub's live state. Its one
durable state bit is the controller-owned refresh lease label, which serialises
the single fairness re-proof admitted above a saturated CI cap; the label is itself
reconciled from live PR/check state. Losing a redundant full wake-up therefore
costs nothing so long as one sweep runs. Live-state race guards remain defense in depth for
pre-deploy jobs and out-of-band callers: `already_settled` and the expected-head
reread prevent a stale actor from labeling a merged or newly advanced PR as a
conflict.

A GREEN CAN GO STALE WITHOUT GOING RED (operator ruling 2026-08-06). Everything
above judges a head's checks. Nothing above asked WHICH exact main SHA they tested,
and a check proves the head against the base it was handed, not against the base
that exists at merge time. PR #4583 is the worked example:

    07:42Z  #4583's head is pushed; its `ci` run starts and concludes success
    10:26Z  #4607 merges tests/test_us_reclaim_veto_packet.py onto main — a guard
            that pins a copy of the CT_BOTH_FAIL / CT_RECLAIM_FAIL constants
    22:51Z  #4583 merges on the 07:42 green, ~15 hours old and never re-run

The green was HONEST. That guard did not exist in the tree the 07:42 run tested.
#4583 changed those constants, main went red, and 18 open pull requests inherited
a `ci-pack-1` failure until #4645 repaired it.

CORRECTION, because the record is wrong where someone will look for it: #4645's
commit message attributes this to a ci.yml path-filter gap. It was not one. At
#4583's OWN merge commit (9aca28d248c) `engine/signal_quality.py` was covered
TWICE in `on.pull_request.paths` — explicitly at line 169 and again by `engine/**`
at line 312. Every path filter was correct; the proof was simply old. Widening
`paths` would have changed nothing, which is precisely why the fix has to be about
TIME, not coverage.

So before an otherwise-clean pull request is merged, `ProofFreshness` reads the
immutable base SHA recorded on the exact head's pull-request checks, then asks
whether newer main commits entered the PR's TESTED SURFACE. If they did, nothing
merges: the head is handed to `update-branch` and its fresh checks decide on a later
sweep. If they did not, the existing green still means what it said. That is the
operator's chosen option — NOT strict up-to-date-with-main, which would serialise a
60-PR queue into days. Missing proof identity defers WITHOUT changing the branch:
mutating code cannot repair a control-plane read, and doing so would self-reprove
forever.

A MERGED PULL REQUEST CAN DELIVER NOTHING (measured 2026-08-09). Every gate above
judges the head's CHECKS; none of them ever asked whether the head still contains
the pull request's WORK. Four armed pull requests (#5055 #5061 #5078 #5091) sat
through a day of update-branch/refresh cycles and came out with their branch heads
clobbered to content-identical-with-main — #5055's head at merge time,
6f9a7f63bfb, contained none of its files. Their checks were honestly green (they
tested what was effectively main's own content), the freshness gate was satisfied,
and the sweeper squash-merged EMPTY diffs: merge commits 455130e4faa, e7564f0fc7b,
db48f1d6aa9 and 0ae4270c76a all carry empty diffstats, the PRs read MERGED, and
zero files landed. (#5074, merged in the same drain, was NOT a phantom — its
squash landed a deliberately amended floor guard.) That is the worst outcome this
lane can produce, because it READS as success — the loss surfaced only when a
human verified the files on main by content, and recovery re-landed 14 files
byte-exact in #5198.

So `sweep_pull` now refuses ANY armed pull request whose live `base...head`
compare is EMPTY — unconditionally, immediately before the irreversible step. An
earlier draft of this invariant keyed on a DISAGREEMENT instead: live diff empty
while the PR's materialised files view still names files. The recovery lane
measured that shape VACUOUS — GitHub recomputes the files view against the
clobbered head, so all four phantoms' files lists read 0 files pre-merge and the
disagreement never occurs. Emptiness alone is the signal, and refusing on it
costs nothing: no legitimate armed pull request has an empty diff, because
squash-merging one records MERGED while delivering nothing — a phantom at worst,
a pointless no-op at best. The refusal labels `merge-blocked` and explains once,
naming the head SHA so the owner can find the good pre-clobber commit (or close
a genuinely empty pull request). See `live_diff_file_count` for the mechanism
and `update_branch` for the likely clobber source.

THE SWEEPER CAN STARVE ITSELF (measured 2026-08-07). Everything above spends API
calls without ever asking how many are left. `READ_TOKEN` is the job's own
`GITHUB_TOKEN`, whose Actions quota is **1,000 requests per hour PER REPOSITORY**
— shared by every concurrent sweep and by every other lane in this repo that
reads with `GITHUB_TOKEN`. A full sweep of the armed backlog costs roughly

    1 listing + ~3 baseline + 1 main timeline + ~6 walking main for a proved
      commit + 1 per pull request (check runs) + ~4 per pull request that is
      clean-but-refused (files, merge, settled, update-branch)

which run 31148157570 (04:39Z, 93 pull requests: 84 blocked / 5 conflict /
4 pending) spent as ~121 calls in 82 seconds. The `workflow_run` trigger fires
far more often than that budget allows — 23-28 non-skipped sweeps in the 02Z
hour — so 28 x 121 = ~3,400 calls against a 1,000/hr bucket. The bucket empties,
every later sweep 403s on its FIRST call, and because sweeps keep firing they
keep consuming each refill. Measured outage: continuous failure 03:34Z-04:38Z,
recovery at 04:39Z, one clean hourly window.

That is a self-sustaining deadlock, and it is the mechanism behind this repo's
recurring armed backlog: a big backlog makes each sweep expensive, the token
starves, nothing merges, the backlog stays big.

So the sweep is now BUDGET-AWARE, in three places. It preflights `GET
/rate_limit` (which does not itself count against the core budget) and DEFERS —
exit 0 with a notice, never a red run — when the remaining budget cannot fund a
useful pass. It sizes the pull-request window from the live core limit (25 at the
historical 1,000/hour limit, up to 100 on Enterprise), in a rotating order that no
pull request can be starved out of, and it says which ones it deferred. And it
re-reads the budget as it goes, stopping cleanly rather than dying half-way
through on a 403. A deferred sweep merges strictly FEWER pull requests than a
full one, never more.

A COMMIT WALK CANNOT FIND MAIN'S PROOF ON A HIGH-VELOCITY BRANCH (measured
2026-08-08). The base-inherited-red path below is the mechanism that drains the
armed backlog after a main-red episode, and for its first two weeks it was
STRUCTURALLY INERT. It asked "which checks are green on main?" by walking main
newest->oldest over a fixed budget of the last 20 commits, looking for one that
published `ci-pack-*`. Two facts of this repository make that walk unable to
succeed:

  * `ci.yml` has NO `push` trigger — its `on:` is `pull_request` +
    `workflow_dispatch` only. main is therefore proven ONLY when somebody runs
    `gh workflow run ci.yml --ref main` by hand, a couple of times a day at best.
  * main takes ~24 commits per 2 HOURS from the nightly and wire lanes
    (press-wire, earnings-wire, research_vault, whitehouse, `data:` timings).
    They are `[skip ci]` or path-filtered, so they publish ambient checks
    (`sweep`, `wire`, `immune`, `monitor`, ...) and never a pack.

So the 20-commit window spanned ~100 MINUTES while the newest real proof of main
sat 117 COMMITS / 12 HOURS back. Run live against this repository, the walk
returned 18 ambient names and zero `ci-pack-*`, while 31 armed pull requests were
blocked on `ci-pack-2`, 29 on `ci-pack-3`, and main's newest completed ci.yml run
(4b61c11a16f8, 11:20:04Z) had all four packs `success`. "every failing check is
clean on main" was therefore false for every one of them, forever: 48 armed pull
requests, ~40 of them also carrying `merge-blocked`, needing a human audit every
day.

This is VELOCITY-DEPENDENT, which is why it "used to work". PR #4968 repaired a
different halt condition in the same walk but kept the fixed 20-commit budget, so
it worked on the day it landed (a dispatch happened to be recent) and decayed back
as the wire lanes got busier. Any commit-count budget has the same fate.

`main_proof` therefore stops walking commits and asks for the thing actually
wanted — the newest concluded run of each proof workflow on main, and its per-job
conclusions — in 4 requests instead of up to 20, against the same `READ_TOKEN`
budget that starved this sweeper on 2026-08-07. And because the answer is only as
good as its freshness, `ensure_main_baseline` lets the sweep ORDER the proof it
needs rather than waiting for a human to dispatch one.

REFRESHES ARE CAPPED TOO, and for a second reason. `update-branch` is the
sweeper's answer to three different situations — a stale-but-clean proof, a merge
GitHub refused, and (since the base-inherited-red path in `main_proof`)
a red the PR inherited from a main that has since been healed. That third one is
the dangerous one at scale, because it makes a large fraction of the backlog
eligible AT ONCE: the measured shape was 84 of 93 armed pull requests red on the
same `ci-pack-1/2/3`. Each refresh is a write call AND a fresh `ci` run, which
takes 36-91 minutes on an 8-runner self-hosted pool. Uncapped, the first sweep
after that path shipped would have queued ~84 pack runs from a single 46-second
job — a multi-day CI jam, and a much worse outage than the one being repaired.
`MAX_REFRESHES_PER_SWEEP` drains the same backlog over ~11 sweeps instead, which
at the observed sweep rate is well under an hour. A pull request whose refresh
this sweep could not fund is left ARMED AND UNLABELED, never `merge-blocked` —
it has done nothing wrong, and `mark_blocked`'s comment is one-shot, so a false
accusation would be the one that sticks.

Individual pull-request outcomes are ANNOTATIONS, never job failures: one PR with
a red check must not fail a sweep that also had clean PRs to merge. The process
exits non-zero only when the sweep itself could not run — and a sweep the API
budget deferred DID run, correctly, so that exits 0.

         deferred to the next sweep is the whole repo deferred with it.
      1. the durable refresh-lease owner. It must stay inside the evaluation cap
         until its proof settles, even when it is older than the first pull page.
      2. the head the TRIGGERING workflow run just concluded on. The sweeper wakes

    The rotation is what makes the cap fair. This script keeps NO state between

    advances by `cap` every `bucket_seconds`, which walks the whole ring and

    how long it has sat. Sorting by `updated_at` was the obvious alternative and
    it starves: a pull request nothing acts on never has its timestamp bumped, so
    it would hold its place — or lose it — forever.

    The rotation applies WITHIN tier 0 as well, which is what keeps two armed
    repairs taking turns. Only the first repair in the order gets the single
    per-sweep repair slot, so a permanently-red repair that always sorted first
    would hold that slot forever and its sibling — possibly the one that actually
    fixes main — would never be evaluated at all.

    States are ``green``, ``pending``, ``red``, or ``unproven``. Only ``green``

    current main: a successful proof from an abandoned history is not evidence.

    Data/site-only commits intentionally do not trigger the baseline workflow.
    Their current-main descendants therefore accept the latest source proof when
    GitHub's compare endpoint confirms ancestry.

    A ``cancelled`` newest run is SKIPPED, not read as red. `integration-baseline.yml`
    runs under `concurrency: integration-baseline-main`, so a push to main that lands
    while a baseline is pending supersedes it — a routine event on a branch this repo
    pushes to every few minutes, and NOT evidence that main is broken. Reading
    `per_page=1` and treating `cancelled` as a non-clean conclusion latched this breaker
    red for 8.5h on 2026-08-05 (run 31014967682, cancelled 14:23Z) and held 49 armed PRs
    behind it until a baseline was dispatched by hand.

    AN IN-FLIGHT NEWEST RUN IS SKIPPED FOR THE SAME REASON (2026-08-08). This function
    used to read `runs[0]`'s status first and return ``pending`` whenever it was not
    `completed`, so a `queued` run OUTRANKED a concluded green underneath it. That is
    the same category error #4638 fixed for `cancelled`: **a run that has not concluded
    is NO INFORMATION**. A concluded green is positive evidence about a real SHA; a
    queued run is the ABSENCE of evidence, and halting on absence is not fail-closed —
    it is fail-blind, and it fails in the direction that stops the repository.

    Measured 2026-08-08, main GREEN: the newest concluded baseline was `success` at
    05:00:51Z, with a `queued` run from 05:31Z (waiting 75+ min on a saturated hosted
    pool) and a `pending` one from 06:45Z stacked on top. The breaker therefore reported
    ``pending``, and each of the last 8 successful sweeps ended
    `25 baseline-blocked, 71 cap-deferred` — ZERO pull requests evaluated, 8 merges in
    24h against 43 created. `integration-baseline.yml` triggers on every source push to
    main and the wire/nightly lanes push every few minutes, so under load a baseline is
    almost always in flight: the old rule made "almost always blocked" the steady state.
    integration-baseline.yml's own 2026-08-07 note already named this half of the defect
    ("the circuit breaker reads a never-concluding newest run as `pending`, and pending
    blocks ordinary merges") when it flipped `cancel-in-progress` to false.

    Every fail-closed property is kept. One bounded 100-run listing falls through to
    the newest run that
    actually CONCLUDED and decides on that one: a genuine `failure`/`timed_out` stops
    the walk and returns ``red`` (an in-flight run can never launder a red, and an older
    green is never reached past one), the ancestry check still applies to whichever run
    is chosen, a window with nothing concluded in it returns ``unproven``, a read
    failure still raises, and only ``green`` admits ordinary pull requests. What is new
    is that a green must also be FRESH: past `BASELINE_MAX_AGE_HOURS` it yields
    ``pending``, because "main was proven six hours and two hundred commits ago" is a
    different claim from "main is proven".

    `BASELINE_MAX_AGE_HOURS` without this function is the very defect it was added
    alongside: a gate that halts on the absence of evidence and has no way to produce
    any. `integration-baseline.yml` does have a `push` trigger, but its `paths:` filter
    deliberately excludes data/site publisher commits — so the only pushes that re-prove
    main are SOURCE pushes, and the only source pushes to main are merges. A stale green
    therefore blocks merges, which stops the pushes, which keeps it stale: a quieter
    deadlock than the in-flight one, and one that needed a human who knew to run
    `gh workflow run integration-baseline.yml --ref main`. The only escapes were that
    dispatch and the single `main-red-repair` slot. So the sweeper orders it itself.

    ONLY the stale-green reason dispatches, and the reason is RE-DERIVED from the runs
    rather than parsed back out of the state's display string (the lesson
    `failing_check_names` records: display strings are for humans, decisions are made
    from data). Concretely, all of these must hold:

      1. the breaker said ``pending`` — never ``red`` (main is broken; a new baseline
         would faithfully re-prove the same red and change nothing), never ``unproven``
         (nothing concluded to be stale — something is already in flight or every run
         was superseded), never ``green``, and never a read failure, which raises out of
         `integration_baseline_state` and aborts the sweep before this is reached;
      2. the newest CONCLUDED run is clean and older than `BASELINE_MAX_AGE_HOURS`.
         An UNDATABLE one does not qualify: age unknown is not age exceeded, and
         dispatching on it would make an unparseable timestamp a dispatch loop;
      3. the anti-stampede guard below.

    (3) COPIES `ensure_main_baseline`'s SHAPE ON PURPOSE — one query for the newest run
    at ANY status, then two refusals: a newest run that has not concluded means a proof
    is already coming, and a newest run created inside
    `INTEGRATION_BASELINE_MIN_INTERVAL_MINUTES` means one was ordered too recently to
    order another. That single rule covers the `requested`/`waiting`/`pending` statuses
    a `status=in_progress`+`status=queued` pair would miss, the read-then-write race
    between pre-deploy/out-of-band sweeps, and the window between a successful
    dispatch and the run becoming visible.
    See `INTEGRATION_BASELINE_MIN_INTERVAL_MINUTES` for why a raced dispatch is
    genuinely harmful here rather than merely wasteful. It is a BOUND, not a lock:
    two sweeps inside the same second still see the same pre-dispatch state, and what
    saves them is the group's `cancel-in-progress: false`, which means the loser of that
    race is a pending run replaced by an equivalent one and never a running proof.
    An UNREADABLE answer is treated as "something is running" — one sweep of latency
    instead of a stampede.

    NEVER FATAL. Every failure path logs and returns a short string for the sweep
    summary; a sweep that merged pull requests correctly must not go red because it
    could not order a baseline.

#: The workflows whose runs on main constitute "main is proven". `ci.yml` publishes
#: the `ci-pack-*` checks the armed backlog is overwhelmingly red on (31 pull requests
#: on `ci-pack-2` and 29 on `ci-pack-3` when this was measured); `fences.yml` publishes
#: `fence-pack` and the three always-on fence contexts, and a `fence-pack` red must be
#: refreshable for exactly the same reason a pack red is. The FIRST entry is the anchor:
#: it supplies the reported head sha, and it is the workflow `ensure_main_baseline`
#: dispatches, because it is the one with no `push` trigger to dispatch itself.
#:
#: THE TWO SIDES PUBLISH DIFFERENT PACK SETS since the dynamic-matrix conversion
#: (2026-08-11), and that asymmetry is load-bearing rather than a defect to tidy away.
#: A pull request now publishes only the `ci-pack-*` its changed paths selected — any
#: subset of the twelve, sometimes none at all — because `ci-pack` is gated on
#: `needs.ci-plan.outputs.has_work`. Main is proven by a `workflow_dispatch`, which
#: passes no `--changed-from`, so the planner has no changed set, widens to the full
#: suite by the fail-safe rule, and still runs all twelve. That asymmetry is exactly
#: what keeps the base-inherited-red refresh viable: a PR can only go red on a name
#: main's baseline also publishes, so `bad_names <= clean_names` still has something to
#: be a subset OF. Narrow main's baseline to a changed set and this mechanism goes
#: quiet with no red anywhere to show for it — the 2026-08-08 backlog shape, arrived at
#: from the other direction. `ci-gate` is the stable AGGREGATE name, published on every
#: non-closed event by both sides; it is the one to hand branch protection or an
#: external controller, since no individual `ci-pack-N` is guaranteed to appear.
#:
#: `MAIN_PROOF_WORKFLOWS` itself now lives with the tested-surface gate above (#5397,
#: which needs it to build `.github/workflows/<name>` before this point in the file).
#: This block stays here because it documents WHY those two workflows are the proof
#: and what the anchor position means, which is what `MAIN_BASELINE_WORKFLOW` reads.
MAIN_BASELINE_WORKFLOW = MAIN_PROOF_WORKFLOWS[0]
#: How many completed runs to look back through, per workflow, for one that CONCLUDED.
#: `status=completed` includes `cancelled`, and until 2026-08-09 `fences.yml` cancelled
#: newest-wins on every push to main — ~24 commits per 2 hours meant a large minority
#: of its runs were superseded rather than judged (2 of the newest 8 on 2026-08-08;
#: ALL TEN during the 11:40Z push burst of 2026-08-09, which zeroed the whole fences
#: proof and helped pin the fleet). #5136 exempts main pushes from the cancel, so a
#: fences run on main now CONCLUDES — but the walk stays: older cancelled runs remain
#: in the listing, operators and timeouts still cancel, and reading `per_page=1` would
#: let any one of them zero out the whole proof, re-creating the intermittently-inert
#: mechanism this function exists to end. The same shape already burned this file once:
#: `integration_baseline_state` latched the breaker red for 8.5h on a cancelled newest
#: run. 10 is one request either way — the walk costs nothing extra.
MAIN_PROOF_RUN_WALK = 10
#: Above this age, main's proof is too old to answer today's reds and the sweep orders a
#: fresh one (see `ensure_main_baseline`). Three hours is chosen against the two clocks
#: that matter: a ci.yml run here takes 30-34 minutes, so the sweep is never dispatching
#: on top of a proof that is merely mid-flight, and the measured gap this repair exists
#: to close was 12 HOURS, so anything in this range is a decisive improvement while
#: leaving the hosted pool ~8 baselines a day at worst.
MAIN_PROOF_MAX_AGE_HOURS = 3
#: The floor between two sweeper-ordered baselines, and the STRUCTURAL bound on the
#: dispatch rate — the one guard that does not depend on the proof being datable.
#:
#: The job-level group now coalesces full sweeps, but this interval remains defense in
#: depth for pre-deploy jobs and out-of-band callers: "is one already running?" is a
#: read-then-write race that more than one actor can win. That
#: race used to be catastrophic rather than wasteful: ci.yml ran every ref under
#: `cancel-in-progress: true`, so a dispatch on main landed in `ci-refs/heads/main`
#: and a SECOND dispatch CANCELLED THE FIRST — 31148430602/31151246743 (2026-08-07,
#: 53 minutes apart), then the 2026-08-09 cascade (31309720615 killed 44 minutes
#: in-progress by 31311537537, itself killed while still queued by 31311693575),
#: where armed-PR sessions pulling the documented lever faster than a 30-45 minute
#: run can conclude meant NO main proof ever concluded at all. The operator call an
#: earlier revision of this comment declined to make unilaterally has now been made
#: (2026-08-09, #5136): ci.yml keeps `cancel-in-progress` FALSE for every
#: `workflow_dispatch` (and fences.yml for everything but `pull_request` events), so
#: a raced dispatch can no longer kill a RUNNING proof — the loser lands in the
#: group's single pending slot, the same shape integration-baseline already has
#: (see INTEGRATION_BASELINE_MIN_INTERVAL_MINUTES).
#:
#: The interval therefore remains load-bearing, but against the smaller harms: a
#: raced dispatch overwrites the QUEUED run, discarding its accumulated queue
#: position (the re-pinned ref SHA is at least as fresh, so correctness is
#: unharmed), and every dispatch spends quota. 30 minutes is just under a run's own
#: 30-34 minute duration, so in the normal case the newest run is still in flight
#: and the status check answers first; the interval covers the two gaps that check
#: cannot: the seconds between a dispatch and the new run becoming visible in the
#: API, and racing sweeps that all read the pre-dispatch state. It is a rate BOUND,
#: not a lock — a stateless level-triggered reconciler has nowhere to hold a lock.
MAIN_BASELINE_MIN_INTERVAL_MINUTES = 30
#: What counts as main PROVING a name, which is NOT the same question `CLEAN_CONCLUSIONS`
#: answers. That set's own comment says membership means "did not fail" and NEVER
#: "passed", and `decide_verdict` supplies the affirmative-pass requirement separately —
#: #4779: "an absence of failure is not a pass". `clean_names` has no such backstop: it
#: is asserted evidence that main is GREEN on a name, used to excuse that name's red on a
#: pull request, so here "did not fail" MUST be read as "passed".
#:
#: A `skipped` job on the baseline is the dangerous one. It is legitimate on a PR head (a
#: path-filtered pack that skips is a real clean result, which is why `CLEAN_CONCLUSIONS`
#: keeps `skipped` and must not be narrowed), but on main it means the job did not run,
#: and treating that as proof would excuse a red on a check that produced no verdict.
#: Costs nothing today: every real job on main's newest ci.yml + fences.yml runs
#: (`ci-plan`, all twelve `ci-pack-*`, `ci-gate`, `fence-pack`, `self-mod-fence`,
#: `capability-broker`, `grader-manifest`) is `success`; the only `skipped` entries are
#: the fork-fallback jobs, which GitHub reports under their UNEVALUATED `name:`
#: expression and so can never collide with a real check name. That accident is exactly
#: why this must be pinned rather than left implicit — the first statically-named
#: conditional job added to either workflow would end it. Main still publishes all
#: twelve packs because its baseline is a `workflow_dispatch` with no `--changed-from`
#: (see MAIN_PROOF_WORKFLOWS); a PULL REQUEST may publish any subset, but a pack that
#: never launched there is a name absent from the head, not a `skipped` job here.

      `MAIN_PROOF_WORKFLOWS`. Only ever WIDENS what a red pull request may do.
    ``proved_at``   — tz-aware UTC. The OLDEST of the per-workflow newest
      completions, because a proof is only as fresh as its stalest component.
      ``None`` means undatable, which the timestamp gate reads as "no".
    ``head_sha``    — the main commit the anchor workflow's run was computed on.
    ``source``      — a short human string for the sweep log; on failure it says WHY
      there is no proof, which is the line a future session greps for.

    EMPTY IS NOT THE SAME AS UNDATED, and conflating them is a live incident, not a
    tidiness point. A main whose packs all FAILED yields no clean names, but it was
    still proven, at a knowable instant — 4 of the newest 10 main ci.yml runs were
    `failure` when this was measured. Dating that proof `None` made
    `ensure_main_baseline`'s age gate unable to fire, so every sweep with a blocked
    pull request ordered another baseline, which came back red, which dispatched
    again: measured 10 dispatches in 10 consecutive sweeps, ~164 hosted jobs/day
    against an intended ceiling of 8. So an all-red baseline returns an EMPTY
    ``clean_names`` (nothing may be refreshed — correct) with a REAL ``proved_at``

    ``resolved`` is ``(names main PASSED, when the run's verdict landed)``; ``why``
    carries the HTTP status when the read failed, for the same reason
    `_newest_concluded_main_run` does — "unreadable" and "read fine, proved nothing"
    have opposite causes and opposite fixes, and the sweep log has to say which.

    PER JOB, not per run. A run whose overall conclusion is `failure` still proves
    every pack that passed inside it, and that distinction is most of the value here:
    a main whose `ci-pack-2` is green and `ci-pack-3` is red must refresh the pull
    requests red on 2 and keep blocking the ones red on 3.

    PASSED, not "did not fail" — `PROOF_CLEAN_CONCLUSIONS`, see that constant for why
    this is deliberately stricter than `CLEAN_CONCLUSIONS`.

    THE RETURN VALUE ANSWERS TWO SEPARATE QUESTIONS, and an earlier revision answered
    them with one `None` for both. "I could not read this run" and "I read it and every
    job failed" are opposite facts: the first must leave the proof undated, the second
    must date it — an all-red main is PROVEN, just proven red. Collapsing them made the
    age gate in `ensure_main_baseline` unfireable and turned a red main into an
    unbounded dispatch loop (10 dispatches in 10 sweeps, measured). So a run that reads
    is always ``(names, when)`` even when ``names`` is empty, and ``None`` means only
    that the read failed.

    ``when`` is the newest completion among the CLEAN jobs when there are any, and
    among all considered jobs otherwise. The first is the conservative choice for
    `proof_postdates_failures` (a later red inside the same run must not re-date the
    green that excuses a pull request); the second only ever applies when
    ``clean_names`` is empty, where nothing can be excused at all and the date is used
    purely to say "main was proven this recently, do not order another baseline".
    Either way it is None if any job in the dating set carries an unusable
    `completed_at` — an undatable component makes the proof undatable rather than
    optimistically dated, and `MAIN_BASELINE_MIN_INTERVAL_MINUTES` bounds the dispatch
    rate in that case instead.

    Under-reading is safe here and over-reading is not, which is why the single
    `per_page=100` page needs no truncation guard: a job past the first page is a job
    missing from `clean_names`, and a missing clean name can only WITHHOLD a refresh.

def main_proof(repo: str, token: str) -> MainProof:
    """What main currently proves, resolved from its WORKFLOW RUNS. 4 requests.

    Read ONCE per sweep and shared by every pull request, because it answers a
    question about main, not about any pull request.

    This exists to tell two reds apart that look identical on a pull request:

      * the pull request broke something — its red is its own, and blocking is
        correct;
      * main was red when the pull request last ran, the pull request inherited that
        failure, and main has since been healed — the red describes a base that no
        longer exists.

    The second shape is what regenerates the armed backlog, and answering it is what
    drains one: every time main goes red, every armed pull request inherits it.

    WHY NOT A COMMIT WALK. This used to ask the question by walking main's last 20
    commits for one that published `ci-pack-*`. That cannot succeed here and the
    reason is arithmetic, not a bug in the loop: `ci.yml` has no `push` trigger, so
    main is proven only by a manual `gh workflow run ci.yml --ref main` a couple of
    times a day, while the nightly and wire lanes push ~24 `[skip ci]` / path-filtered
    commits per 2 HOURS. Measured 2026-08-08, the 20-commit window spanned ~100
    minutes and the newest real proof of main sat 117 COMMITS / 12 HOURS back; the
    walk returned 18 ambient names (`sweep`, `wire`, `immune`, `monitor`, ...) and
    ZERO packs, while 31 armed pull requests were blocked on `ci-pack-2` and 29 on
    `ci-pack-3` — all four packs `success` on main's newest ci.yml run. Raising the
    commit budget only buys time: PR #4968 fixed a different halt condition in the
    same walk, worked the day it landed, and decayed back as the wire lanes got
    busier. A workflow-run lookup has no window to outgrow.

    It is also CHEAPER, which matters because the budget it is charged against is the
    one that starved this sweeper on 2026-08-07: 4 requests (two workflows x newest
    run + its jobs) against up to 20 for the walk, on a `READ_TOKEN` whose quota is
    1,000/hour PER REPOSITORY and shared by every concurrent sweep.

    FAILS CLOSED ON WHAT IT CANNOT READ. A non-200, a missing run, an unparseable
    payload or any exception returns an EMPTY, UNDATED proof, and an empty set can
    never be a superset of a non-empty failing set, so the caller falls through to the
    unchanged `merge-blocked` path. Not knowing what main proves is never permission to
    refresh anything. That rule applies to the WHOLE union, not per workflow: half a
    proof would let a `fence-pack` red be excused by a ci.yml run that says nothing
    about fences.

    A RED WORKFLOW IS NOT AN UNREADABLE ONE. If a run reads and simply passed nothing,
    its names are absent from the union — which already blocks every refresh that
    depended on them — but the proof keeps its DATE, and the other workflow keeps its
    names. Zeroing the union there would be wrong twice: it would discard a genuinely
    green `fences.yml` because `ci.yml` is red, and it would leave the proof undated,
    which is the shape that turned a red main into an unbounded baseline-dispatch loop.

    No exception escapes — the pre-existing "a diagnostic must never fail a sweep"
    property is preserved, and the sweep degrades to its pre-2026-08-07 behaviour.

    THE CLAIM THE REFRESH MAKES IS TEMPORAL. "Your red checks are all green on main"

    red. If main's green PREDATES the failure, the pull request ran against an
    already-proven-green main and the red is its OWN — refreshing it would rebase a
    genuine regression out of sight, which is the one outcome the narrowness of that
    branch exists to prevent. The name comparison alone cannot see this.

    IT IS ALSO THE LOOP GUARD, and that is not a bonus — it is required now that the
    path can actually fire. The branch used to argue that no loop was possible because
    `update-branch` answers 422 on an already-current head. That reasoning assumes a
    STATIC main and is false here: main takes ~24 commits per 2 hours, so a head is
    never "already current" for long, and a pull request that comes back red on the

    pull requests per round, indefinitely, on a pool that takes 30-34 minutes per run.

    THE SWEEPER'S ANSWER IS ONLY AS GOOD AS MAIN'S PROOF, and until now that proof
    depended entirely on a human remembering to run `gh workflow run ci.yml --ref
    main`. `ci.yml` has no `push` trigger — see `main_proof` — so on a branch taking
    ~24 commits per 2 hours the evidence the refresh path needs was measured 12 HOURS
    stale while 48 pull requests sat armed. Repairing the lookup without repairing the
    supply would have fixed the mechanism and left the daily audit in place.

    So the sweep dispatches the baseline itself, but ONLY when all three hold:

      1. the proof is undatable or older than MAIN_PROOF_MAX_AGE_HOURS, OR it has
         no ``failed_legacy_jobs`` while this sweep blocked a pack or ``ci-gate``.
         A clock-fresh green proof cannot feed the live-inherited waiver, and
         ``ci.yml`` has no ``push`` trigger — skip-ci tape ticks never refresh it.
         This is NOT a per-commit dispatch: (2) and (3) still bind it;
      2. at least one pull request this sweep evaluated was blocked on a non-spurious
         check — i.e. the staleness actually COST something. An idle repository never
         dispatches, however old its proof is; a proof nothing needed is not a problem;
      3. the newest ci.yml run on main has CONCLUDED and was created at least
         MAIN_BASELINE_MIN_INTERVAL_MINUTES ago.

    (3) IS THE ANTI-STAMPEDE GUARD and it is load-bearing. It is ONE query for the
    newest run at any status, not the two `status=in_progress` / `status=queued`
    queries an earlier revision used, and the difference is not cosmetic:

      * those two left `requested`, `waiting` and `pending` entirely unchecked;
      * they were a read-then-write race between pre-deploy/out-of-band sweeps;
        until 2026-08-09 a raced dispatch even CANCELLED the
        in-flight proof (ci.yml then cancelled newest-wins on every ref — #5136
        exempts dispatches, so the racing loser merely overwrites the queued
        pending slot);
      * they could not see the window between a successful dispatch and the new run
        becoming visible in the API.

    The created-at interval covers all three, bounds the dispatch rate even when
    several sweeps race, and costs one call instead of two. It is a BOUND, not a lock —
    sweeps inside the same second still see the same pre-dispatch state. An UNREADABLE
    answer is treated as "something is running", the direction that costs one sweep of
    latency rather than a stampede.

    (1) and (2) are asked FIRST because they are free; only a sweep that has already
    decided it wants a baseline spends a call asking whether it may have one.

    NEVER FATAL. Every failure path logs and returns; a sweep that merged pull requests
    correctly must not go red because it could not order a baseline. Returns a short

# --- recorded-hold guard --------------------------------------------------------
#
# WHY (2026-08-20, PR #6109). A HOLD-FOR-SOL comment was posted on #6109 by its
# author, and the shared account squash-merged it anyway a short while later with
# no release comment. Fleet law already says a recorded hold binds every merge
# path (`DEC:SOL-HOLD-IS-A-MERGE-BARRIER`), but the automation had no way to SEE a
# recorded hold — its only hold mechanism was the hardcoded `NEVER_AUTO_MERGE_PULLS`
# frozenset above, which nobody had (or reasonably could have) added #6109 to. A
# re-armed `merge-on-green` label — any session can add labels — silently overrode
# an authority hold that lived only in prose. This guard closes that gap: it reads
# the pull request's own body and comments for a hold marker immediately before the
# irreversible merge call, so the label can never again be the last word.
#
# SCOPE (documented, not built — 2026-08-21 adjudication item m7): a hold binds
# via the PR BODY and issue COMMENTS only. Review bodies and inline review
# comments are a distinct GitHub API surface (`/pulls/{n}/reviews` and
# `/pulls/{n}/comments`) this guard does not read; an authority posting a hold
# there instead is not yet covered, and this is a known, accepted boundary
# rather than a bug — see the same line repeated in `hold_guard_comment`.
#
# MARKER CONTRACT (2026-08-21 adversarial-review fix set, item B1). A marker
# must BEGIN a candidate line — see `_candidate_marker_lines` — not merely
# appear anywhere in the text. The first cut of this guard matched anywhere in
# the body/comment text (`re.search`), which the live PR corpus falsified
# immediately: ordinary prose that MENTIONS a hold ("PR #6109 was merged over a
# recorded HOLD-FOR-SOL...") matched exactly as hard as a real declared hold,
# so this guard's own explanatory PR body would have held ITSELF forever, and
# any records/handoff PR narrating the #6109 incident would have been silently
# blocked too (measured false positives: #6149 this PR, #6143, #6146, #6151).

HOLD_GUARD_AUTHOR_TYPE = "Bot"
# Case-insensitive on purpose: a hold posted as `hold-for-sol` or `Hold-For-Sol`
# binds exactly as hard as `HOLD-FOR-SOL` — the marker is a convention, not a
# cryptographic token, and treating case as significant would let a typo silently
# defeat the barrier.
#
# `HOLD_RELEASE_RE` is checked BEFORE `HOLD_MARKER_RE` on every comment, in
# `_classify_comment` below, and wins outright when both match — release
# outranks hold WITHIN one comment (item M1(a)). `HOLD-RELEASED` itself starts
# with `HOLD-` and therefore satisfies the generic `HOLD\s*[—:-]` hold
# sub-pattern; without this precedence rule a release comment would register as
# BOTH a release and (at its own timestamp) the newest hold, so "strictly later
# than the newest hold" could never be true and no release could ever fire —
# the exact defect the live corpus's own natural release sentence exposed

# "hold", and this feature's OWN vocabulary is exactly that shape ("hold-
# guard"), so a title like "fix(merge-on-green): hold-guard regression test"

def recorded_hold(

    """Is this pull request currently under a recorded hold? Pure, no network.

    A HOLD marker (`HOLD-FOR-<...>`, `HELD FOR <...>`, bare `HOLD:`/`HOLD—`, or
    `DO NOT MERGE`; see `HOLD_MARKER_RE`) must BEGIN a candidate line — see
    `_candidate_marker_lines` — in the pull request BODY or in any issue
    COMMENT. A RELEASE is a comment whose own candidate line begins with
    `HOLD-RELEASED`.

    `title` (item N1(a), round-3) is `pull["title"]`, matched with a plain
    ANYWHERE `.search()` — not the line-start-anchored candidate machinery
    the body and comments go through. Titles are short, single-line, and
    declarative by GitHub convention (this repo's own titles read
    ``fix(x): ... — DO NOT MERGE`` or ``HOLD-FOR-SOL · sol(...): ...``), so
    the false-positive surface a `.search()` opens is near-zero — verified
    against the corpus: none of #6149/#6143/#6146/#6151's titles contain any
    marker substring. A body-only false negative on a live true positive
    (PR #6051's ``## Scratch research harness — DO NOT MERGE`` heading, whose
    body ALSO catches it via item N1(b) below — the title is a second,
    independent source, not the only fix) is what this closes.

    Body-carried and comment-carried holds are classified THE SAME WAY (item
    N2, round-3): both go through `_classify_comment`, so a body LINE that
    states a RELEASE (``HOLD-RELEASED by Sol 2026-08-21``) is never
    mis-registered as a hold via the generic `HOLD\\s*[—:-]` sub-pattern —
    round-2 scanned the body with `HOLD_MARKER_RE` directly, skipping the
    release-outranks-hold precedence entirely for body text.

    Comment-carried hold: cleared only by a release comment strictly LATER than
    the newest DATED hold-carrying comment. An UNDATED hold comment (no
    parseable `created_at`) is tracked separately and is cleared by ANY dated
    release comment at all, since an undated timestamp cannot be compared
    against anything (item m5) — an undated release, symmetrically, can never
    clear anything, since it cannot be proven "strictly later".

    Body/title hold (no comment carries the marker): released only by a
    release comment that is BOTH strictly later than every dated
    hold-carrying comment AND the newest non-excluded, non-BOT comment on the
    whole pull request (item M1(c), narrowed by item N7 round-3). ACCEPTED
    TRADE-OFF, intentional: this makes body-hold release asymmetric in both
    directions. An old, otherwise-unchallenged release still clears a body
    hold added long after it, because there is no per-edit body timestamp to
    compare against (an old release with zero later HUMAN comments IS, by
    definition, still "the newest comment"). And ANY HUMAN comment posted
    after a release — even unrelated chatter — re-arms a still-present body
    hold, because the release is no longer the newest human comment. Only
    HUMAN comments participate in this "newest comment" contest (item N7):
    holding and releasing are human acts, so a Bot's chatter posted after a
    release — including this sweeper's OWN red-check refusal comment — must
    never re-arm it. The honest, unambiguous escape for an authority is
    always to edit the marker out of the body directly; this function
    re-reads current text on every call, never a cached copy.

    A comment is excluded from EVERY match here — hold, release, and the
    "newest comment" ranking — whenever `_is_bot_comment` says it was posted
    by a Bot identity (item N7, round-3; strictly broader than round-2's
    `_is_guard_own_comment`-only exclusion, which this function no longer
    uses directly — every guard comment is itself Bot-authored, so the
    broader check still excludes it, while ALSO excluding every other bot's
    chatter from re-arming a release).

    Returns the matched marker text (for the explanation), or None when the
    pull request is not currently held.

    This is the GROUND-TRUTH answer to "what would this squash merge apply",
    computed from the refs as they stand NOW. The pull request's own `files` view
    is deliberately NOT consulted as a cross-check: an earlier draft of the
    invariant keyed on live-vs-view disagreement, and the recovery lane measured
    that shape vacuous — GitHub recomputes the files view against a clobbered
    head, so all four 2026-08-09 phantoms' files lists read 0 files pre-merge and
    a disagreement never occurs. Emptiness of this compare alone is the signal
    `sweep_pull` refuses on.

    The base SHA is returned too because the merge endpoint's ``sha`` fence protects
    only the PR HEAD.  If main moved after :class:`ProofFreshness` took its snapshot,
    a long sweep could otherwise merge against a base it never classified.  The
    caller requires this live base to equal the frozen snapshot tip and retries on
    the next level-triggered sweep when it does not. GitHub exposes no atomic
    base-SHA compare-and-swap on this merge endpoint, so a tiny read-to-PUT race
    remains; eliminating that last gap requires branch protection/native merge
    queue semantics, while the exact-head SHA fence still closes the head side.

    Cost: one READ_TOKEN GET per pull request that reaches the merge step, inside
    RATE_LIMIT_RESERVE's headroom. ``per_page=1`` bounds the commits array; ``files``
    rides the first page, and only its EMPTINESS is consulted, so GitHub's 300-file

    that moved since is a different question (the next sweep's). The base side
    falls back to "main" when the listing payload carried no base ref — every
    armed pull request here targets main, and a wrong-base compare can only make
    the diff LARGER, which reads "proceed", i.e. the pre-invariant behaviour.

    WHY (2026-08-06). Sweeps could overlap, and pre-deploy or out-of-band runs can
    still race. The workflow-level `concurrency` group that used to serialise them
    was removed because it did not serialise
    work — it serialised a multi-hour wait for a GitHub-hosted runner, and killed
    98 of 100 consecutive sweeps in the pending slot while doing it (see the
    postmortem in .github/workflows/merge-on-green.yml).

    Raced sweeps are safe by construction almost everywhere: this script is
    a level-triggered reconciler that re-reads every labeled pull request and
    re-derives every verdict from GitHub's live state, carrying nothing across
    runs. Re-reading a check twice costs a call and changes nothing; two sweeps
    racing the same squash merge cannot double-merge, because GitHub answers the
    loser 405/409.

    There is exactly ONE unsafe spot, and it is this one. `sweep_pull` reads a
    405/409 as "the base moved or the branch conflicts", tries `update-branch`,
    and on refusal applies `merge-blocked` plus a one-shot comment saying *not
    merging*. Against a pull request another sweep merged one second earlier,
    every one of those steps is wrong: update-branch answers 422 on a merged PR,
    so the loser would label a SUCCESSFULLY MERGED pull request `merge-blocked`
    and comment a falsehood on it — and because `mark_blocked` fires its comment
    only on the label transition, that lie is the one that sticks.

    So before a refused merge is allowed to mean "conflict", ask GitHub what the
    pull request actually is now.

    FAILS CLOSED. An unreadable answer returns ``(False, "")``, which falls
    through to the pre-existing update-branch/label path. That is noisier but it
    is exactly the behaviour that shipped before this guard existed, so a broken
    read can never cause a merge or suppress a genuine conflict report.

    ONLY reached for a pull request whose every check already concluded clean and
    whose merge GitHub then refused. The refusal splits two ways and only one of
    them is a human's problem:

      * the base moved under us — the head is fine, it is simply no longer merge-
        able against the newer main. GitHub can fast-forward that itself, and the
        resulting head re-runs CI before anything merges.
      * another actor changed the head after this sweep read its checks — the
        expected-SHA update is correctly refused, and the caller leaves the new
        head armed and unblocked for a fresh judgment;
      * a real content conflict — update-branch answers 422 while the head is
        unchanged and the caller falls through to `merge-blocked`.

    This is the fix for the observed failure mode: main takes ~19 commits in 3
    hours while a pack run takes ~30 minutes, so a pull request can go green and
    be stale before its own proof finishes. Every such head then waits for a human
    to rebase it by hand, which is how a one-hour-old pull request becomes a
    three-day-old one. Nothing here weakens the merge gate — an updated head is
    unproven until its fresh checks conclude, and the next sweep judges it on
    those.

    NOT the clobber vector, for the record (the 2026-08-09 phantom merges). When
    four armed heads were found clobbered to content-identical-with-main after a
    day of refresh cycles, this call was the obvious suspect — it is the thing
    that keeps touching armed heads. It is exonerated by its own failure mode:
    GitHub's server-side update-branch NEVER auto-resolves a conflict, it answers
    422 and the caller falls through to `merge-blocked`, so it can add merge
    commits but cannot invent a resolution that takes main's side. The likely
    source is the fleet's LOCAL refresh work between sweeps — a session resolves
    a refresh/rebase conflict in a worktree and force-pushes — where two known
    mechanisms produce exactly this shape: (a) bulk conflict auto-resolution
    taking main wholesale (`-X theirs` / `checkout --theirs`-style) during
    backlog drains, and/or (b) `git rerere` replaying a SIBLING pull request's
    "take main's version" resolution onto a different conflict in the same file,
    marker-free and status-clean (measured 2026-08-07 on #4821/#4822;
    `rerere.enabled` is false at repo level now, but the shared `.git/rr-cache` —
    worktrees share `.git` — still carries those recorded resolutions, and any
    worktree or `-c` override that re-enables it replays them). Either way the
    head ends content-identical with main, its checks go green on main's own
    content, and only the live compare can tell — which is why the
    clobbered-head invariant in `sweep_pull` sits at the merge itself, not here.
    The clobber mechanism is deliberately NOT fixed in this file: it lives in the
    fleet's local tooling, and the invariant makes it non-catastrophic.

    ``freshness`` is REQUIRED and has no default on purpose. A default would let a
    caller that forgot to build it merge on an unidentified green forever, which is the
    exact failure this parameter exists to close; making it required turns that
    mistake into a TypeError at the call site instead of a silent no-op.

    ``proof`` — what main is currently proven to pass and when, from
    :func:`main_proof`. It only ever WIDENS what a red PR may do (see the
    base-inherited-red branch), never what a clean one may merge, so unlike
    ``freshness`` a missing value is safe: it defaults to an empty proof, which
    reproduces the pre-2026-08-07 behaviour exactly.

    ``budget`` is the same shape of optional: it only ever WITHHOLDS
    `update-branch` slots, so its absent form (no cap) reproduces the uncapped
    behaviour and it can never authorise a merge the check gates would refuse.

    ``blocked_names`` is an OUT-parameter, not an input: the sweep passes a set for
    this function to record what its blocked pull requests were blocked ON, which is
    the evidence :func:`ensure_main_baseline` needs to decide whether a stale main
    proof actually cost anything this pass. Nothing here reads it, so it cannot
    influence any verdict.

    WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-11, PR #5291). The job-level `if:` in
    .github/workflows/merge-on-green.yml used to skip every `failure` wake-up, and
    the essay there argued it "fails SAFE — a red PR simply stays armed and unmerged,
    which is the correct outcome either way". That assumed nothing else touches the
    label during the window in which the red is real but unmarked. Measured:

        02:05:18Z  ci run 31449929887 concludes FAILURE on #5291's head 9ce3c2ef
        02:13:32Z  another session runs `gh pr edit 5291 --remove-label merge-on-green`
        02:13:34Z  the arm label is gone: no `merge-blocked`, no comment, no marker
        02:13:41Z  the next sweep lists the ARMED pull requests — #5291 is not in it

    Eight minutes of red-and-unmarked, and then the pull request left the
    label-filtered world this sweeper lives in permanently: with the arm label gone
    the marker could never arrive on any later sweep, ever. The cron cannot be the
    answer — measured ~0.5 sweeps/hour against a nominal 6 — so the marker has to
    land BEFORE the window rather than after it, which means waking on the failure
    that opens it.

    DELIBERATELY NOT A SWEEP. This pass never merges, never `update-branch`es and
    never dispatches a proof baseline. It reads one head's checks and
    writes at most one marker, which is what keeps a failure wake-up affordable: ~4-8
    requests (listing + one check-run page + at most the 4-request proof lookup + two
    writes) against READ_TOKEN's 1,000/hr PER-REPOSITORY budget. Even at the measured
    ~26 failure wake-ups an hour that is well inside the bucket a real sweep needs,
    which is the only reason the `if:` may admit failures at all. Anything that would
    make this pass expensive belongs in the full sweep, not here.

    Always exits 0 on a red pull request: a red is the lane working, not a fault.
