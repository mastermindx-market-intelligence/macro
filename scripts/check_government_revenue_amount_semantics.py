"""Guard: Government Revenue dollar figures of different CLASSES never become one number.

The rule this enforces is the lobe's central financial-honesty claim, written twice as
prose and, until this file, enforced by nothing:

    "obligation, outlay, ceiling, bookings, backlog, funded backlog, and GAAP revenue
     are never conflated"      — GOVERNMENT_REVENUE_FORESIGHT_ACCOUNT_HANDOFF.md
    "funded obligations are never conflated with ceilings, appropriations,
     announcements, or GAAP revenue"  — GOVERNMENT_REVENUE_FORESIGHT_MASTERPLAN_FOR_FABLE.md

The classes, and which pairs are dangerous, live in ONE place —
``engine/government_revenue/amount_semantics.py`` — whose coverage is DERIVED from the
collector's own canonical number-column declarations, so a field cannot join a ledger
without a class.  This file is the reader that holds the source tree to it.

WHAT IS A VIOLATION

  mixed_class_sum       ``+`` (or ``sum()``/``fsum``) across two classes.  Adding a
                        transaction delta to an award cumulative double-counts; adding a
                        ceiling to an obligation reports authorised capacity as activity;
                        adding an outlay to an obligation counts the committed dollar
                        again when it is paid.
  mixed_class_fallback  A fallback LADDER whose rungs are different classes —
                        ``("total_obligated", "award_amount", "current_award_amount")``
                        yields an obligation on most rows and a CEILING on the rows where
                        only the last rung survives, under one output name, with no trace
                        of which happened.  The quietest of the four mixes.
  mixed_class_default   ``row.get("a", row.get("b"))`` / ``a or b`` across classes — a
                        two-rung ladder wearing different syntax.
  unlabelled_figure     A published amount fact that carries the number but not the class:
                        no ``semantic``/``label_code``, or one belonging to another class.
                        The v2 contract types ``semantic`` as a free string, so this is
                        the only place the label is held to the field it describes.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* A VIOLATION

  SUBTRACTION across classes.  ``potential_award_amount - total_obligated`` is the
  lobe's defined headroom ("observed potential capacity"), and
  ``obligation - outlay`` is the unliquidated balance.  Both are real quantities with
  published basis copy.  It is ADDITION that has no definition — you cannot total two
  measurements of different things.  A guard that flagged subtraction would be wrong
  about finance, and a guard that is wrong gets switched off.

  Unknown names.  A name with no declared class contributes NOTHING; silence is
  "unknown", not "compatible".  Guessing would manufacture findings, and the point of
  this file is that its findings are real.

  A name proved inside ANOTHER function.  ``metrics._backlog``'s ``current_total`` really
  is a ceiling total — and it is a local of ``_backlog``.  An expression a thousand lines
  later that happens to use the same word names nothing, so bindings are SCOPED
  (``_Scope`` / ``_PythonScanner._binding_scope``): an inner scope may read an enclosing
  binding, it may only write its own, and a class does not leave the function that proved
  it.  The flat tracker this replaced reported ``float(current_total) + float(denom)``
  inside ``_catalysts``, where neither name exists.

  A count, a label, or a container.  ``len(value_items) + len(changes)`` adds two
  cardinalities, and ``verb = "deobligation" if amount < 0 else "positive contract
  action"`` is a WORD that a delta merely chose.  A class is read only from an
  expression's VALUE positions (``_PythonScanner._value_fields``) — never from the
  condition that picks the value, and never past a call whose result is a different KIND
  of thing.  A container's own NAME is likewise not a figure — but its members' classes
  are kept against that name (``_member_fields``) and recovered the moment the collection
  is folded back into one number, by a total or by an element read, so hoisting a list out
  of ``sum(...)`` no longer hides the mix.

  Two figures of different classes rendered SIDE BY SIDE.  The dossier's
  Obligated / Current value / Potential ceiling row is the honest presentation, not the
  defect.  Only a single figure built from more than one class is a finding, which is why
  the template rule is scoped to one ``money(...)`` call's own argument.

    Every rule is scoped to its own claim.  The first draft of this file flagged any
    all-string collection containing two classes, which made six of its seven findings
    inventory lists (``SNAPSHOT_STATE_FIELDS``, ``RECOMPETE_KEYS``, the projector
    allow-lists in build_government_revenue.py) — lists whose members are carried
    SEPARATELY and never totalled.  A guard that reports those buries the one real
    finding under noise and teaches the next reader to ignore it, so each rule below
    now requires the syntactic shape that actually merges values:

      * ``+`` where BOTH sides carry a class, and the two sides disagree;
      * a totalling call over a collection literal spanning classes;
      * a ladder handed to a first-present-wins READER, or a ``for … break`` loop;
      * ``get(k, default)`` / ``a or b`` where both rungs carry a class and disagree.

    Local names are tracked when an assignment's right-hand side mentions exactly ONE
    declared amount field (``obligated = pd.to_numeric(active.get("total_obligated"))``);
    all-string collections are tracked by their member list so a ladder hoisted to a
    constant is still resolved at its call site, and a collection of amount VALUES is
    tracked by the fields its members measure (``_member_fields``) so a list hoisted out
    of ``sum(...)`` is resolved at ITS call site too.  Four shapes that hid real mixes are
    tracked as well, each stated as a rule where it is implemented: a class-neutral
    RE-BIND does not clobber a class the name already proved (``_bind_class``), a LOOP
    VARIABLE walking a known field ladder carries that ladder's class (``visit_For``), an
    ELEMENT taken out of a single-class container carries its members' class
    (``_value_fields``), and every binding is SCOPED to the function that made it
    (``_Scope``/``_binding_scope``) so a name proved inside one function does not stay
    classed for the rest of the module.

    What a tracked class means is PROVENANCE — which declared field this value came from —
    read only through the expression's own VALUE positions (``_value_fields``), never
    through a position that merely decides the value.  Both halves are load-bearing and

          * the TEST of a conditional, a comparison, and ``not``.  ``verb =
            "deobligation" if amount < 0 else "positive contract action"`` is a WORD;
            ``amount`` chooses between two words, it is not the word.  Reading the test
            is how ``event_type``, ``kind``, ``verb`` and ``amount_type`` — string
            labels, every one — came to be classed ``transaction_delta``.
          * a call in ``_KIND_CHANGING_CALLS``.  ``len(value_items) + len(changes)``

        Everything else propagates, INCLUDING an opaque helper call

        so refusing there would also refuse ``pd.to_numeric(active.get("total_obligated"))``,
        the binding both mutation tests rest on.  What survives is a name whose
        PROVENANCE is right and whose runtime type is unknown; it can only produce a
        finding by being ADDED to a differently-classed name, and for a non-number that
        means string or list concatenation between two such names — which fails toward a

          * two or more                       -> no class (the value's own measurement is

          * none                              -> LEAVE the existing class in place.

        The third line is the fix.  This lobe writes every amount local with a defensive
        rebind, so ``pop on silence`` made the guard blind to the function that most needed
        it — ``metrics._backlog`` uses the idiom on all three of its amount locals::

            obligated = pd.to_numeric(active.get("total_obligated"), errors="coerce")
            if obligated is None:
                obligated = pd.Series(float("nan"), index=active.index)   # popped the class

        and with the class popped, flipping the genuine ``current - obligated`` headroom to
        ``current + obligated`` — a CEILING added to an OBLIGATION, the exact mix this file
        exists to refuse — scanned clean.  A placeholder is the ABSENCE of the quantity, not
        a different quantity: the branch runs only because the real value was missing, so it
        cannot be a second measurement.  The module's own law for combining says silence is
        "unknown", not "compatible"; the same law read for TRACKING says silence is
        "unknown", not "reclassified".  A re-bind that carries a DIFFERENT class is real
        counter-evidence and still overwrites, so Python's last-wins semantics survive.

        The other honest option — union the classes and report an ambiguous union — is
        deliberately NOT taken.  A local genuinely reused for two measurements would then be
        reported at every downstream USE, blaming expressions that mixed nothing, and the
        union would be manufactured by the tracker rather than found in the code.  This
        file's precision is the reason it is allowed to exist (its first draft's six
        findings were inventory lists), so the rule that cannot invent a mix wins.  The
        residual cost of preserving is a stale class on a local silently repurposed for
        something else — which fails toward a REPORT a reader can dismiss, not toward the
        blindness that shipped.

        The ladder map below keeps last-wins on purpose: a ladder's members are a property
        of the VALUE, and a re-bind to a non-literal leaves genuinely unknown members, so
        there is nothing to preserve.

        SCOPING closes the third gap.  "Existing" is now read from the scope the write
        lands in, and every outcome WRITES there — ``None`` meaning "bound here, carrying
        no class".  That explicit shadow is what stops a local from silently inheriting an
        enclosing binding of the same name: in Python a name a function assigns is that
        function's own from its first line, so a re-measured or class-less local must not
        fall through to the module.  Preservation therefore stays what it always was — a
        property of ONE name in ONE scope — instead of a property of the whole file.
