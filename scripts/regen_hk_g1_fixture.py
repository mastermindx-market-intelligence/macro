"""Regenerate the frozen HK G1 board fixture from the committed close panel.

WHAT THIS RE-PINS
-----------------
``tests/fixtures/hk_board_2026_07_31.json`` is the 2026-07-31 HK board panel: the
verdict / meta / trailing-closes slice of ``data/hk_search/closes_deep.parquet``
that ``tests/test_hk_board_rank.py`` replays the G1 gates against.  It is a
MEASUREMENT frozen at an as-of date, not a hand-built board, so it is only
trustworthy while it still matches the panel it was measured from.  Two tests in
``TestG1FixtureIsNotStale`` enforce exactly that:

  * ``test_source_panel_history_is_unchanged`` — every frozen 90-session tail must
    equal the matching historical slice of the live panel, date for date and
    close for close.
  * ``test_witness_verdicts_replay_from_the_live_panel`` — the seven witness
    tickers' verdicts must re-derive from the live panel through the real
    ``engine.signal_gate``.

The panel is append-only in normal operation, and an append does not invalidate a
historical replay.  A REWRITE at or before the as-of date does — and yahoo ships
those routinely as dividend adjustments, which rescale a ticker's entire history
by a constant ratio (PR #4559: 2338.HK's whole tail moved by ~0.9871).  Those
tests then hard-fail on a fixture nobody touched.  This script is the remedy:
it rebuilds the ENTIRE fixture from the panel, with the same slices those tests
check, and refuses to write when the drift does not look like an adjustment.

USAGE
-----
    python3 scripts/regen_hk_g1_fixture.py            # re-pin (writes only on drift)
    python3 scripts/regen_hk_g1_fixture.py --check    # report, never write
    python3 scripts/regen_hk_g1_fixture.py --force    # write through a refusal

Exit codes: 0 = byte no-op or written · 1 = fatal (missing fixture, NaN payload)
· 2 = refused (structural / non-adjustment drift) · 3 = ``--check`` would write.

This script re-pins an EXISTING freeze.  The era parameters (``_as_of``, the
window stamp, ``_source``) are read from the committed fixture and never minted
here: a new era is a deliberate act that re-pins the paired artifact
``tests/fixtures/hk_standouts_2026_07_31.json`` and ``BOARD_ASOF`` in the same
commit (see the ``prod_board`` docstring in the test module).

THE WINDOW IS PER-TICKER AND IT IS NOT A COUNT (#4565 defect, fixed 2026-08-05)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each ticker's frozen window is re-cut from **its own committed first date** —
``hist[ticker].dropna().loc[frozen["dates"][0]:]`` — which is character for
character the slice ``TestG1FixtureIsNotStale::test_source_panel_history_is_
unchanged`` compares against.  A regenerator must generate what the guard checks.

It used to cut a FLAT ``series.tail(_tail_sessions)`` from one constant, and that
is wrong wherever the era's windows are not all the same length.  The
2026-07-31 freeze is one such era: it is **3B-phase-aligned**, so each window
starts at the latest session at or before ``tail(340)`` satisfying
``np.busday_count(column_start, start) % 3 == 0`` and the file therefore holds
THREE tail lengths (342 x72, 341 x51, 340 x34) behind a single ``_tail_sessions:
340`` stamp that is false for 123 of its 157 tickers.

The alignment is load-bearing, not cosmetic.  ``engine/signal_quality.signal_
frame`` builds the move anchor from ``daily_close.resample("3B").last()``, and
3B bins anchor on the series' FIRST index date — so re-cutting a flat tail
re-phases the grid and the frozen verdicts' marker dates stop being bucket
labels at all.  MEASURED on the 2026-07-31 panel: a flat ``--force`` re-pin
re-phased 123 of 157 tickers (phase histogram 0:34 / 1:51 / 2:72 where every
committed ticker was phase 0), and the HK vetoed lane collapsed from
``population 33 / measured 33 / max move 24.3%`` to ``measured 5 / max 4.7%``.
The censoring is TOP-FIRST — ranks 1-11 of 33 deleted — so the surviving maximum
carries no information about the panel it claims to summarise, and the lane's
own ``max(moves) > 20.0`` tripwire fired as an apparent data falsification
rather than the fixture-shape defect it was.

Two consequences are built in below:

  * the committed per-ticker start is authoritative for every ticker the fixture
    already carries — the count is never consulted for slicing;
  * the era's window RULE is machine-readable (``_tail_anchor``) so a ticker the
    panel newly qualifies gets a window cut by the same law as its siblings
    instead of an invented one, and the rule is re-derived against all 157
    committed starts on every run.  A rule that no longer reproduces the file it
    describes is a REFUSAL, because the next minted window would be wrong.

THE ERA-STAMPED SHAPE (why each rule is what it is)
---------------------------------------------------
Every rule below was fitted against the committed file and reproduces it exactly.
They are conventions of the 2026-07-31 freeze, not re-derivable preferences, so
they are recorded here rather than left to the next regenerator's judgement.

*Ticker set and order* — ``[c for c in panel.columns if hist[c].dropna().shape[0]
>= 250]``, in PANEL COLUMN order, and the same order in ``verdicts``, ``meta``
and ``closes``.  Reproduces the committed 157 tickers in the committed order.

*The 9-key verdict prune* — the stored verdicts carry only ``eligible``,
``tier_cascade``, ``ticks``, ``fresh_bars``, ``above200``, ``weekly_bull``,
``provisional``, ``asof`` and ``last`` (itself normalised to the four keys
``date``/``type``/``quality``/``reason``, null-filled).  This was never a
historical ``signal_gate.compact()`` schema: ``_VERDICT_KEYS`` already carried
today's 19 keys at the fixture's birth commit c781a4cd483.  The 9 keys are
#4421's deliberate lean prune, and they are exactly the harness READ CLOSURE —
the lane builders in ``engine/hk_board_rank.py`` and ``engine/us_board_rank.py``
read only those fields (plus ``last.{date,type,quality,reason}``), and the
witness replay compares five of them.  Regenerated values are byte-identical to
the stored ones across all 157 tickers under today's engine (verified
2026-08-05, zero drift), so preserving the shape keeps the fixture byte-stable,
keeps the diff on a future re-pin surgical, and avoids the documented NaN hazard
that the full schema's ``state``/``last`` payloads can carry (see
``buy_signal()``'s docstring in ``engine/signal_gate.py``).

*The marker widening, adjudicated 2026-08-13* — the upstream marker HAS since widened,
three times, and the prune's own warning fired on **157 of 157** markers, which is the
same thing as being switched off: a warning that cannot stay quiet cannot announce
anything, and it could no longer distinguish a fourth key from a Tuesday.  Re-measured
against the read closure above, the prune is still CORRECT and the four stored keys are
still exactly what is read — so the remedy is the reviewed allowlist
:data:`MARKER_DROPPED_KEYS`, not a wider fixture:

  * ``reasons`` (#4583), ``signal_date`` (#5071, Prophet US) and ``confirmed_date``
    (#5258, Prophet US) are the three live keys; ``recorded_at``
    (``engine/marker_integrity.merge_markers``) is render-time provenance this path
    cannot emit, allowlisted so the schema closure is exact.
  * READ CLOSURE, re-measured: ``engine/hk_board_rank.py`` reads
    ``last.{type,quality,date,reason}`` and ``engine/us_board_rank.py`` reads
    ``last.{date,type}`` — nothing reads the three.  ``TestG1FixtureIsNotStale::
    test_witness_verdicts_replay_from_the_live_panel`` compares ``eligible``/``ticks``/
    ``fresh_bars``/``above200``/``weekly_bull`` and never touches ``last`` at all.
  * The three are DISPLAY/AUDIT tier by their own contracts — ``SCHEMA.json`` calls
    ``reasons`` "display-only, never a gate input", and ``engine/marker_integrity.py``
    files the two dates under ``_DERIVED_DATE_FIELDS``, "a function of the marker's own
    ``date`` plus the grid, NOT independent facts".  Storing a value derived from inputs
    the fixture already freezes buys no witness and costs a re-pin every time the
    Prophet date family moves; ``confirmed_date`` would additionally import the very
    live-null hazard the prune exists to keep out.
  * The marker schema is not left unguarded by the drop: it has its own surface in
    ``research/signal_engine/SCHEMA.json`` (``additionalProperties: false``),
    ``engine/marker_integrity.py`` and ``engine/prophet_integrity.py``.  Widening here
    would DUPLICATE that coverage inside a board-replay fixture, which is not what this
    file is a witness of.

The allowlist is pinned to that schema by ``tests/test_regen_hk_g1_fixture.py``, so a
FIFTH key reds the guard rather than being swallowed, and the per-ticker WARNING now
fires only on a key nobody has reviewed.  The stored shape is unchanged, so this
adjudication is byte-neutral on the fixture.

*Default ``reclaim_veto``* — the gate is called as
``signal_gate.compact(signal_gate.gate(ticker, series))``, i.e. with the DEFAULT
``reclaim_veto=True``, not the HK-production ``reclaim_veto=False``.  That is
deliberate: the frozen replay's contract is the witness test's own call, and
that test calls the default.  Changing it here would green this script while
reddening the test it exists to satisfy.

*``meta.price``* — ``round(px, 2)`` at or above HK$1, ``round(px, 3)`` below.
Fits 157/157; a plain 2dp rule fails on the two sub-dollar witnesses 3333.HK
(0.163) and 0884.HK (0.039).  The threshold is only bounded by the data to the
half-open interval (0.163, 1.06]; HK$1.00 is chosen as the round number inside
that band.

*``meta.off_high``* — ``round((px / max(last 252 sessions) - 1) * 100, 1)``, with
``-0.0`` normalised to ``0.0``.  The 252-session window is uniquely correct:
252 fits 157/157, while full history fits 52/157, the 90-session tail 40/157,
250 sessions 151/157, 260 sessions 151/157 and a calendar 52-week window
147/157.

*``meta.dir``* — the constant ``"flat"``.  All 157 stored values are ``"flat"``,
and production's ``dir`` is a cycle-ladder field the price panel cannot produce
(``"dir": r.get("cycle_dir") or "flat"`` in ``scripts/build_hk_library.py``), so
the generator stamps the fallback.  The lanes read ``dir`` only as
down / not-down, so the fallback is faithful for the replay.

*The byte contract* — ``json.dumps(obj, indent=1, allow_nan=False)`` encoded
ASCII, no trailing newline, default separators.  ``allow_nan=False`` is the NaN
gate, not a formatting choice: a NaN anywhere in the payload aborts the run
BEFORE any write rather than persisting a value that reloads as a float the
tests cannot compare.

PROVENANCE AND THE NO-OP
------------------------
``_source_sha256_16`` is stamped only on a REAL write.  Step one of the protocol
serialises the candidate carrying the COMMITTED sha and compares bytes, so an
append-only panel advance — which moves the panel's sha but not one byte of the
frozen payload — is a byte-level no-op: nothing is written, and the recorded sha
keeps pointing at the panel image of the last genuine freeze.

DRIFT PROTOCOL
--------------
When the bytes do differ the candidate is classified, not blindly written:

  * provenance-only (``_note`` / sha alone) — benign, written;
  * adjustment drift — every drifted ticker must keep its dates AND satisfy a
    constant-ratio signature; each one prints an ``ADJUSTMENT-SIGNATURE`` receipt
    line so the regeneration commit carries proof the rewrite was an adjustment;
  * anything else — ticker set changes, calendar surgery, non-constant close
    drift, or verdict/meta drift on a ticker whose closes did NOT move — is
    REFUSED with a receipt.  ``--force`` writes through, after diagnosis.

The constant-ratio tolerance is 0.0025 in price units: the closes are stored at
3dp, so both sides of the comparison carry a rounding of up to 0.0005 and the
implied per-session ratio wobbles accordingly (#4559 measured a 0.987044-0.987071
spread from exactly this noise, on a genuinely constant adjustment).

The signature also needs at least TWO changed sessions to mean anything.  With one,
the median ratio is that session's own ratio and the residual is zero by
construction — a test that cannot fail is not a test, so a lone re-printed close is
refused rather than waved through as an "adjustment".
