"""Frozen outcome frame for the Prophet US conditional-fusion arena (PR-1a skeleton).

Binding spec: ``research/PROPHET_CONDITIONAL_FUSION_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md`` §7
(frozen outcome definitions) and §9.4 (era-aware evaluation).  RESEARCH TIER, ZERO
AUTHORITY: this module reads committed stores, writes nothing under ``data/``, and
nothing it produces may move a rank, a size, or a gate.  It imports no ranker.

WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE MODULE FROM THE ARENA.  The outcome definitions are the part
of the arena that must be frozen BEFORE any challenger exists (§8.6 promotion gate:
"frozen now, before any result exists").  Keeping the label frame in its own leaf
module — imported by ``scripts/prophet_fusion_arena.py``, importing nothing from it —
means a diff that touches an outcome definition is visible as a diff to THIS file, and
cannot hide inside a modelling change.  The shared refusal base class lives here for
the same reason: the dependency arrow points arena -> labels, never back.

WHY EVERY FAILURE IS A TYPED REFUSAL, NEVER AN EMPTY FRAME.  The keystone store
(``data/us_prophet_rank/grades/``) does not exist yet (masterplan §4.0 — accrual is
BROKEN).  ``engine.us_prophet_grades.load_grades()`` answers an absent store with an
empty DataFrame, which is the correct contract for a nightly that must not crash and
the WRONG one for a research harness: a metric computed over zero rows is a number,
and a number is quotable.  Every load path here raises :class:`StoreEmptyRefusal`
naming the store instead.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT BUILT (nulls printed, never proxied)
-------------------------------------------------------------
* **O4 Entry quality** — owned by Live Entry Radar (#5578 §10).  This program defines
  NO rival entry outcome, so the Entry head is DEFERRED and reported as such.  The
  earlier ``fwd_mdd``-before-``fwd_mfe`` stand-in was itself a rival outcome and is
  withdrawn (masterplan §7 O4).
* **O6 Confidence calibration** — no printed-confidence band accrues yet, so the head
  has no ruler and is DEFERRED.  A head with no ruler is unfalsifiable and may not
  move rank (§7 O6).

Both appear in ``receipt["deferred_heads"]``.  A deferred head is never proxied.

UNITS.  ``excess_spy`` in both stores is a FRACTION of price (0.10 == +10pp), not a
percentage.  Every threshold below is therefore a fraction, and
:func:`_assert_fraction_units` refuses a frame that looks percent-scaled — a silent
100x unit error would make every tail and fragility read meaningless while producing
perfectly plausible-looking output.

Usage (report only; the arena is the CLI that consumes this)::
