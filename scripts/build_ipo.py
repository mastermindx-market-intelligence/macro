"""IPO Radar — DISPLAY-ONLY page builder (site/ipo.html).

Renders the honest IPO context page from engine.ipo_radar. The thesis (see
research/IPO_RADAR.md): the day-1 pop is predictable but accrues to the rationed
offer price (uncapturable without allocation), and held from the first close IPOs
underperform — so this is an AVOIDANCE + CONTEXT tool, never a buy signal and never
scored. The page leads with that disclaimer and the aftermarket reality check.

Light by design: it reuses the validated macro de-risk score from
data/regime/spvector_latest.json (written by build_spvector, which runs just before
this in the build_vector hook) rather than rebuilding features — so it costs a
parquet read, the IPO-calendar refresh, and three small relative-strength reads.

Refreshes the Nasdaq IPO calendar (collectors.ipo_calendar) best-effort: if the CI
IP is bot-walled it keeps the committed seed. Writes data/regime/ipo_latest.json
for the landing-hub card. Run: python -m scripts.build_ipo
