"""Static guard: fields their OWN gate rejects must not be rendered directionally (audit #46).

Some engine fields are emitted for context but carry a signed DIRECTION the engine's own
calibration marks unreliable (``direction_reliable: false``) or an outright anti-predictive
standalone read (``gated_out: true``). Examples:
  * btc_leverage_cascade ``oi_only_risk`` — OI percentile is anti-predictive standalone
    (measured lift ~0.36), so it is a crowding TEXTURE, never a de-risk CALL.
  * options_flow tick-rule signed fields (``net_premium_mn`` / ``signed_pc`` / net call/put
    vol) — direction soft until the NBBO signing-calibration gate passes.

The FIELD-LEVEL reliability contract (audit #46) says: every such field carries a
``reliability[<field>] = {gated_out, direction_reliable, ...}`` envelope, and a template MUST
NOT render a gated-out field with a DIRECTIONAL treatment — a risk/red/green color, a
bull/bear/de-risk action label, or an up/down arrow — that reads as a signed call.

This guard has two parts:

  1. ENGINE contract — the named gated fields still emit the reliability envelope with the
     expected gated_out state (catches an engine drift that silently drops the contract).
  2. TEMPLATE honesty — no template renders a gated-out field name adjacent to a directional
     color/action token WITHOUT the neutralizing `muted` treatment. This is a heuristic line
     scan (like check_nav_gap): it flags the exact regression #46 fixed — an `oi_only_risk`
     chip painted `var(--warn)` and labeled "de-risk".

Usage:  python -m scripts.check_reliability_contract [TEMPLATES_DIR]
Exit codes: 0 = clean · 1 = a gated field rendered directionally / contract missing.
