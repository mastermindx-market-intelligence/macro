----------------------------
  data/us_board_ledger/retro_grades.parquet   board membership back to 2026-06-15 plus
                                              85 columns of signal state at entry.

                                              order, via engine.price_ladder. The board's
                                              universe (~1,579 names) is wider than the
                                              caches' S&P-1500, so extras-universe picks
                                              such as ASTS would otherwise be structurally
                                              ungradeable — held, exited, never scored.
  data/breadth/_closes_cache.parquet (+ smallcap / midcap / russell)
                                              LAST RESORT, first-hit-wins in that order
                                              (the precedence build_stock_library uses).
                                              These caches are NOT dividend-adjusted —
                                              this header claimed they were until
                                              2026-08-06. They are raw closes accrued
                                              forward and re-based only at a full
                                              rebuild, so an episode priced here and
                                              measured against SPY books the name's own
                                              dividend as underperformance. Kept as a
                                              rung because dropping a name deletes the
                                              population this study measures; every
                                              episode carries price_source/price_basis so
                                              the residual is visible on the artifact.
  data/yahoo/SPY.parquet                      benchmark leg (excess return). ALWAYS
                                              back-adjusted — which is exactly why the
                                              name leg has to be too.
  data/baskets/latest.json  VIA GIT HISTORY   theme state AS OF the entry date. The file
                                              is overwritten nightly, so the only way to
                                              know what the desk thought of a theme on
                                              2026-07-09 is to read the blob from the
                                              last commit whose own `as_of` is <= that
                                              date. 69 revisions are available.
  data/baskets/membership.json                ticker -> basket ids. CURRENT membership,
                                              not point-in-time — see MEMBERSHIP DRIFT.

MEMBERSHIP DRIFT (a caveat, printed on the artifact and in the report)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
membership.json is a single current file with no per-date history, so a ticker that
JOINED a basket after an entry date will be credited with that basket's entry-date
state. The theme STATE is point-in-time (git); the ticker->theme MAPPING is not. The
sector-basket leg is unaffected (it derives from the row's own sector at entry), and
the board's own `spotlight.theme.slug` is recorded beside the mapped ids so a reader
can see where the two disagree. Reconstructing membership history is a separate job.

SCORING — WHOSE NUMBERS ARE THESE?
----------------------------------
`engine.track_scoring`, unchanged (gate G4). Next-bar-close fill, forced verdict at
H=10, symmetric maturity gate, and NO stop / NO oscillator target: this study measures
the SIGNAL, so it must not mix in an exit policy. The published US ledger applies its
own exit rule, so the two agree except where that rule fired — e.g. IPGP 2026-07-15
scores -17.9% here and -18.7% in the ledger, which stopped out on day 8. Both are the
same fill and the same window; only the exit differs.

RE-ADMISSION: THE PRIOR-EPISODE SCAN
------------------------------------
`prior_episodes()` compares each entry against EVERY prior run of the same ticker whose
board exit sits inside the 10-session window — not just the immediately preceding one —
and reports one of them by a fixed precedence (buildable open drawdown, then resolved
loss, then the nearest prior as a decided negative). An in-window prior that cannot be
priced makes the row UNDECIDABLE rather than clean, and every row carries its comparison
in `prior_episode` with `prior_matured`, so a reader can see whether the number the leg
fired on is a resolved outcome or an outcome-conditioned mark.

IN-FLIGHT ROWS
--------------
Episodes without H forward bars are marked to the latest close, CLASSIFIED (dropping
them would delete the most recent evidence), and then held in a block that enters no
rate. See engine/postmortem.py rule 4.

A MARK IS NOT A VERDICT, AND THE DIFFERENCE EXPIRES
---------------------------------------------------
Five of the eleven names the operator flagged on the 2026-07-31 board were still open
that night: the number that put them on a worst-rows list was a mark. As the bars
printed, four resolved as losses and FN 07-21 closed its tenth bar at +1.66% after a
-19.31% drawdown. Nothing about the engine changed — the mark was never a prediction and
the verdict is not a correction. Anything downstream that copies a cohort label out of a
board snapshot and pins it as permanent is asserting the future, and it will come true
or not on the tape's schedule rather than the code's (a fixture that did exactly this
broke on 2026-08-06, when `data: daily collection 2026-08-06` completed FN's horizon).
`path_tails` exists so the drawdown survives the verdict that erased it.

NO LLM ANYWHERE (constitution A7). Every label is a threshold rule in engine/postmortem.

#: ERA STAMP — PRICE BASIS, 2026-08-06 (#4698 → this PR).
#:
#: This ladder used to put the four breadth caches FIRST, and the note here used to argue
#: that made it "APPEND-ONLY BY CONSTRUCTION … reordering these, or promoting one above
#: the caches, … is a different change requiring its own era stamp". That is the change,
#: and this is the era stamp.
#:
#: The reason the old order could not stand: the caches are UNADJUSTED (raw closes
#: accrued forward, re-based only at a full rebuild) while `bench` is `data/yahoo/SPY`,
#: which IS back-adjusted. `excess_pct` differences the two, so every episode whose window
#: straddled the name's ex-dividend date booked that name's own payout as underperformance
#: against SPY. THIS SITE WAS THE CONTAMINATED ONE: 796 of 807 resolved episodes (98.6%)
#: were priced from the raw caches, because the caches ran FIRST and cover the S&P 1500.
#:
#: Measured A/B on the same day, same universe, same calendar — only the basis differs:
#: 17 of 524 scored episodes move on `excess_pct`, and EVERY ONE MOVES UP (17 positive,
#: 0 negative) — the signature of the defect, since a swallowed dividend is always a
#: headwind. mean +0.588pp, median +0.480pp, worst +2.16pp (LPG 2026-06-18, −4.83 → −2.67).
#: ZERO episodes changed cohort (loser/winner/neutral), so no published classification
#: moves; what moves is the magnitude every downstream average is computed from.
#:
#: Episodes are NOT re-graded in place: this study regenerates its whole artifact on every
#: run, so the boundary is the artifact's own `method.price_basis` / `price_basis_era`
#: stamp plus the per-episode `price_source`. An artifact carrying no such stamp is era 1
#: (cache-first) and its `excess_pct` is not comparable, row for row, with era 2.
#:
#: COVERAGE: no regression, measured. 4 names (ARWR, FN, HL, TR) have a STALE
#: `baskets/ohlcv` store — it stops 2026-07-10/07-21 while the caches run to 07-31 — and
#: naively preferring it cost 2 episodes their score. `min_last` (see
#: engine.price_ladder.resolve_close) walks the remaining ADJUSTED rungs instead of
#: settling for a stale one, which restores them: n_unscored is 30 before and after, and
#: n_matured goes 526 → 529 because the adjusted stores carry deeper history than the
#: caches. Basis is never traded for coverage — a name with NO adjusted source at all
#: still resolves on the cache and says so via price_basis=unadjusted (103 episodes).

    SCANS EVERY PRIOR EPISODE IN THE WINDOW, not just the immediately preceding one.
    Reading `items[i-1]` alone made the label answer a different question than the one
    it prints: a name that came back twice in a fortnight was compared only against its
    latest run, so a qualifying loss two runs back — inside the same 10-session window —
    was invisible. The scan collects every prior run whose board exit sits within
    `READMIT_MAX_SESSIONS` sessions of this entry and then picks ONE to report, by a
    fixed precedence:

      1. a prior that was ALREADY >= 8% under water at the re-admission (the buildable
         leg) — most negative mark wins, latest entry date breaks a tie;
      2. else a prior that RESOLVED to a >= 8% loss (the hindsight leg) — most negative
         outcome wins, latest entry date breaks a tie;
      3. else the NEAREST in-window prior, reported as a decided negative so the reader
         can see what the comparison actually was.

    NULLS, NOT SILENT ZEROS. An in-window prior that could not be scored (no close path)
    is not evidence that the name came back clean, so when no scoreable prior fires the
    row comes back `{"undecidable": "prior_episode_not_scoreable"}` and the engine nulls
    the label and both legs. An entry with NO in-window prior at all gets no key here at
    all, so the caller's lookup yields None — a decided negative that stays in every
    denominator.

    Every row carries `prior_matured`, because an unmatured prior's `outcome_pct` is a
    MARK — outcome-conditioned, and not the same evidence as a resolved loss.
