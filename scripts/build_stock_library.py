"""Build the searchable stock-analysis library (site/stockdata/*.json).

Architecture note: this is a static site — no server, so search cannot hit a
live API. Instead, everything the breadth collector already downloads nightly
(all S&P 500 constituents) plus every stored ETF/stock/commodity/crypto gets
run through the SAME cycle/ladder engine as the sector pages, and each result
is written as a small JSON the search page fetches client-side. Instant
results, no keys, no rate limits; coverage = the library universe, refreshed
nightly. site/stockdata/ is gitignored — regenerated at build time and shipped
only inside the Pages artifact.

Usage: python -m scripts.build_stock_library

    LIMITED record carries no comparable asof depth and is exempt (R1 invariant
    I4). `lib_asof` is the max parseable `asof` among those full recs — the
    library's own tip, self-relative so no wall-clock/calendar dependency.

    A rec whose `asof` cannot be parsed is fail-open (never demoted) and counted

    A rec demotes iff strictly more than `_MAX_BAR_LAG_DAYS` calendar days behind

    (name_score_grader), but a DIFFERENT reference: the ledger gate measures
    against a wall-clock stamp, this measures against the library's OWN max tip

    here can only ever be as late or later than the ledger gate's own refusal,

#     zeroes the board's `runway` leg (0/71 buy rows) and strips the ez-term
#     and the parabolic/stretched grade floor out of conviction.risk.components.ext
#     (engine.stock_score._risk_idio, the largest idio-risk weight at 0.38);
#   * even on a weekday build the union index injects ~62 all-NaN weekend rows into
#     every 200-row window, so px.rolling(200) averages only ~138 actual sessions —
#     ext_z was not the back-tested quantity on ANY day (SPY 07-31: +0.28 mixed vs
#     −0.39 on its own calendar).
# Splitting by calendar fixes both, and matches what build_discovery (equity_factors
# breadth closes), build_hk_library and build_canada_library already feed the module.
# `.iloc[:-1]` does NOT fix it: a weekend or a Monday holiday leaves SEVERAL trailing
# crypto-only rows, and it would silently discard a real session the rest of the year.

    cannot admit — ranked by TOTAL momentum, not by residual alpha.

    Why the rank key changed (measured 2026-08-02, the software-absence
    root-cause): residual alpha is beta-stripped, so it structurally erases a
    theme rally in which a whole cohort rises together. The v1 rule
    (alpha >= 0.5, alpha-desc) held ZERO software names for the entire
    ai_software / non_ai_software leadership run — MSFT / PLTR / APP / CRWD
    class names were never selectable — and filled the strip with idiosyncratic
    small caps (Callaway Golf, Tompkins Financial) whose residual was large only
    because their beta was small. A leaders strip that cannot show the market's
    leaders is not a leaders strip.

    RANK SOURCE (read before changing it): ``momentum_by`` — the cross-sectional z
    of trailing 3-month TOTAL return (engine.us_board_rank.total_return_z). It is
    deliberately NOT the composite's ``momentum`` leg, despite the name: that leg is
    fed by ``alpha_pt[t]["alpha"]`` in the composite assembly above, and measured
    ``corr(alpha, composite.legs.momentum) = 0.984`` on the 2026-07-31 live board.
    Ranking by it would be the v1 residual-alpha rule wearing a different label, and
    the software cohort would stay just as invisible. Trailing total return over the
    same universe correlates ``+0.37`` with residual alpha — a genuinely different
    quantity. ``composite_by`` remains a LAST-RESORT fallback so a momentum-map
    failure degrades to the old behaviour instead of an empty strip; it announces
    itself with a ::warning rather than degrading silently.

    DISPLAY-TIER coverage, never an entry claim. Admission requires an INTACT
    trend (above200 AND weekly_bull from the signal_gate verdict — `is True` is
    deliberate, a None/unanalysed name must never read as intact), a momentum
    reading, price within ``off_high_floor``% of the 52w high (leaders trade near
    highs), not already surfaced (exclude), dir != 'down'.

    Rank key: momentum z + ``LEADERS_THEME_BOOST`` when the name belongs to a
    top-8 in-favour basket (engine.us_board_rank theme map — context weight on a
    DISPLAY lane, never a score or an admission gate), then residual alpha desc,

    """CSP-W5b: measure the actual price reach of the ranked universe panel.

    universe() assembles the panel from stores with independent advancement
    cadences: data/stocks (nightly data commit), the four breadth
    _closes_cache.parquet groups (actions/cache restore), and data/yahoo
    (also re-pulled in-run by check_price_store_freshness --heal lanes).
    When one store advances without the others, the board ranks a MIXED-
    vintage cross-section and the buy lane oscillates between lanes with no
    disclosure anywhere in the artifact — 2026-08-03→05, across 22 builds,
    the only leak was the display-only donor.asof field (yahoo healed to
    08-03/04 while the wedged nightly pinned every other store at 07-31).

    Every member's last-valid bar date is CLAMPED to the NYSE session calendar
    (``last_session_on_or_before``) before it is counted. The board's staleness
    is judged on the NYSE session calendar, and a weekend/holiday bar must never
    claim session reach for — or clear the DELAYED badge of — the equity board.
    The 24/7 exclusion below (exclude=None → the config.yml yahoo.tickers.crypto
    block) is kept as a belt, but it is enumeration and enumeration rots: on the
    2026-08-09 (SUNDAY) bake SIX members of 1,758 carried Sunday-dated bars past
    the three-coin crypto list — a 24/7- or 6-day-calendar bloc no hardcoded set
    was tracking — so ``through`` read 08-09 against the equity majority's Friday
    08-07 and ``mixed_vintage`` went true on a board that was not actually torn.
    Downstream that is not cosmetic: prophet_bridge refuses ALL plan origination
    on a mixed-vintage board (#5071), so every Sunday and holiday-Monday bake
    originated zero plans in silence. The clamp makes the enumeration moot — a
    weekend bar counts as its preceding session — while a member genuinely stale
    at an OLDER SESSION date still counts stale and still tears the panel.

    (First measured on the 2026-08-04 checkout: 3 crypto members reached 08-04
    while no equity close passed 08-03.)

    Returns a compact reach summary for the staleness block (display-only):
      through              max SESSION-CLAMPED last-valid close date (ISO)
      through_raw          max UNCLAMPED last-valid close date (ISO) — the raw
                           disclosure ``max_through`` is computed from, so the
                           clamp changes the judgment and never the facts
      majority_through     modal session-clamped last-valid close date (ISO) —
                           where the bulk of the panel actually ends
      members_at_through / members_total — how many members reach `through`
      mixed_vintage        True when the freshest date is NOT the modal date:
                           a material bloc of the panel is staler than the
                           freshest members (delisted stragglers alone never
                           trigger this — they lose the mode)
      off_majority_tickers members whose clamped date differs from the modal
                           date, sorted and capped at 10 — the names that make
                           `mixed_vintage` true, so a torn board can be
                           diagnosed from its own receipt instead of by

    that its predecessor's only "test" re-implemented the chip text and pinned nothing.

        # shipped the fix since china_board_rank._partition: EVERY eligible row
        # gets a published row carrying its lane, its reasons and a display rank
        # (2026-08-10 CN board: eligible 180 = 24+93+41+22).

        # WHY IT RUNS HERE, AT THE LAST POSSIBLE MOMENT (review M4, 2026-08-11).
        # It first sat right after `score_rows`, and that snapshot was a LIE about
        # what ships: FOUR later passes mutate the same buy rows —
        #   • the W8 arbiter demotes `conviction.band` (and `band == 'low'` IS the
        #     `conviction_low` refusal code, so the arbiter can CREATE a refusal the
        #     early snapshot cannot see),
        #   • `_enforce_blocked_buy_invariant` downgrades urgency and re-labels,
        #   • `_expire_pending_buys` REPLACES wide["buy"] with a new list whose
        #     demoted rows are shallow COPIES carrying pending_expired/lane="watch",
        #     so the early snapshot held row objects that no longer ship at all.
        # Measured on the 2026-08-07 board: 10 rows ship pending_expired=true while
        # the early partition called two of them (BIDU, UEC) `featured`. Building
        # after the last mutator makes the pool describe the artifact it ships in,
        # which is the only property that makes it worth publishing. Everything
