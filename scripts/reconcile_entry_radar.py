"""scripts/reconcile_entry_radar.py — the W5 live-forward evidence reconciler.

THE SOLE DURABLE WRITER (prereg §8, contract §7.3 single-advancer law)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Every ``data/entry_radar/**`` byte in this estate is written HERE, in the US
nightly lane, behind ``engine.ledger_lane.nightly_advance_enabled()``.  The W4
intraday lane spools events and writes nothing durable; the replay runner
(``scripts/entry_radar_replay.py``) writes research artifacts under
``research/`` and nothing under ``data/``.  One store, one writer, no race.

The ``--nightly`` refusal here is HARDER than the one in
``scripts/entry_radar_universe.py``.  That script's gate is a live no-op because
its ``DURABLE_WRITES`` is empty by design; this script's ``DURABLE_WRITES`` is
its whole purpose, so ``--nightly`` outside the nightly lane exits 2 having
written NOTHING — not "written the safe subset", not "written the state file
only".  A gate that lets some writes through is a gate that has to be re-argued
at every new write.

WHAT IT DOES TONIGHT (and why that is the correct output, not a stub)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
W4 — the live evaluator that produces the event spool — does not exist yet.  The
lawful intake is therefore EMPTY, and the prereg names the correct behaviour
exactly: write the ledger state ``WAITING_FOR_LIVE_SOURCE`` with a session
stamp, and manufacture nothing.  The three things this script must never do,
each of which would produce a plausible-looking artifact:

  * **Never synthesize candidates from nightly artifacts.**  The probe set, the
    detector registry and the indicator plane are all sitting right there and
    could be replayed into "observations" tonight.  They would be RETROSPECTIVE,
    and §8's decisive tier is prospective ordering — a row written before its
    outcome exists.  A retrospective row is not a weaker version of that; it is
    a different, non-evidentiary object wearing the same schema.
  * **Never backfill.**  Observations seen before the recorded
    ``live_forward_start`` can never be relabeled live-forward (§8), so there is
    no date from which a backfill would be lawful.
  * **Never reconstruct historical enlistment.**  Q4 (enlisted-G0 vs G0-alone)
    accrues live-forward and ONLY live-forward.  This script carries no
    reconstruction path; battery K proves the absence by AST scan — every
    enlistment identifier in this file must sit inside the one passthrough
    function — rather than by reading this paragraph.

    """Every ``mastermind.entry_event.v1`` record in the spool, in stable order.

    Two spool object shapes are accepted, because the REAL W4 producer and this
    reader's original off-schema assumption disagreed (W4.1 — every envelope W4
    has ever spooled was previously counted-by-omission as "off-schema", so
    this reconciler's live-forward accrual was structurally unreachable from
    the real producer regardless of what the spool held):

      * **the real W4 shape** — one ``entry_radar.events/v1`` PASS ENVELOPE
        (``live_ledger.build_event_payload()``: ``schema``/``pass_ts``/
        ``pass_id``/``pack``/``transitions``/``events``/``health``).  ``events``
        is UNWRAPPED; each inner event is a bare ``mastermind.entry_event.v1``
        dict (the frozen field list, no ``schema`` key of its own — W2's
        ``EntryEvent.to_dict()`` never emits one) and is VALIDATED against that
        contract via ``EntryEvent.from_dict`` before it is trusted — a torn or
        foreign inner record is counted-by-omission exactly like a torn spool
        file always was.  ``spool_then_commit`` is AT-LEAST-ONCE by design (a
        crash between the spool write and the ledger commit re-spools the same
        transitions next pass, ``live_ledger.py`` §"SPOOL BEFORE CONSUME"), so
        the SAME ``event_id`` can legitimately appear in more than one envelope
        across a night's worth of files.  This reader therefore returns AT MOST
        ONE record per distinct ``event_id`` from the envelope branch
        (keep-first content — mirrors ``engine/prophet_lab/sources.py``'s
        ``events_by_id.setdefault`` sibling pattern), with its transport-plane
        ``observed_at`` set to the EARLIEST envelope ``pass_ts`` across the
        WHOLE spool that carried it (§4's "first envelope to carry it" rule) —
        a field the immutable store never has, added to the RETURNED COPY only;
        the append-only ``mastermind.entry_event.v1`` record itself is never
        touched, here or anywhere upstream of this function.  Without this,
        ``append_forward_rows`` (which dedups new rows only against rows
        ALREADY PERSISTED, never within one new batch) would append one
        ``forward.parquet`` row per envelope APPEARANCE of a re-spooled event —
        an unrepairable duplicate in an append-only store;
      * **a bare event record**, with an optional ``{"record": {...}}`` wrapper —
        kept for a producer (or a test fixture) that spools one event directly
        with no pass envelope at all.  Nothing about accepting the real envelope
        shape narrows what this reader already accepted.  (Not deduped by this
        function — a producer spooling bare records is not the W4 at-least-once
        shape this dedup exists for.)

    JSONL and single-object JSON files are both read (one object per line, or
    one array).  A torn or foreign record is COUNTED-BY-OMISSION and annotated,
    never repaired: a reconciler that guesses at a malformed event is a
    reconciler that can invent one.
