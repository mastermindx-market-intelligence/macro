"""Quarterly Kernel Decision Batch — Neural Web W3 PR2.

PRE-REGISTERED DECISION RULE (these constants ARE the registration):
--------------------------------------------------------------------
  FIRST_BATCH_DUE   = '2026-10-01'   — hard cadence gate; refuses to run early
  N_EFF_FLOOR       = 25             — minimum n_eff for a cell to be eligible
  STALENESS_DAYS    = 380            — maximum days since date_last (stale-data guard)
  FDR_ALPHA         = 0.10           — BH FDR alpha (one family: 'reliability_kernel')
  TRIAL_FAMILY      = 'reliability_kernel'
  SIGN_TEST_H0      = 0.5            — null hypothesis: P(positive outcome) = 0.5

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
  1. n_eff >= N_EFF_FLOOR
  2. wilson_ci_low is not None (i.e. n_eff >= WILSON_MIN_N=12 was met)
  3. days since date_last <= STALENESS_DAYS
  4. outcome_basis == 'signed_excess'   ← see OUTCOME BASIS GATE below

OUTCOME BASIS GATE (criterion 4 — protects the promotion decision itself):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The test below is a SIGN test against H0=0.5. It is only a test of anything
when the sign of the underlying outcome carries information.

Four spine ledgers (track_record, board_hk, board_ca, board_cn) fill
outcome_excess from a forward MAXIMUM-FAVORABLE-EXCURSION column that is
non-negative BY CONSTRUCTION, with direction pinned to +1. On such cells
"hits" means "MFE exceeded zero at least once in the window" — measured on the
2026-08-05 index that is ~87% of rows, and a track_record cell carries n_eff
in the tens of thousands. Sign-testing 0.87 against 0.5 at n_eff≈57,000 gives
p≈0; BH-FDR cannot save a family in which the null is false by construction.
Such a cell would be PROMOTED to behavior-changing authority on a tautology.

So: only cells whose outcome_basis is exactly 'signed_excess' are eligible.
Everything else is excluded and COUNTED — never silently dropped:

  - 'unsigned_mfe_proxy'  — the trap above.
  - 'synthetic_sign_stub' — cortex_attention's ±0.01 placeholders. The SIGN is
    real there, so the sign test is technically defined; they are excluded
    anyway because this batch's survivor records publish shrunken_ic and
    wilson_ci_low as an EXCESS-based edge, and promoting on a fabricated ±0.01
    magnitude would put a placeholder into an authority record. If a
    sign-only promotion lane is ever wanted it needs its own pre-registration,
    not a quiet reuse of this one.
  - None / missing column — a parquet built before the column existed, or an
    unmapped ledger. FAIL-CLOSED: unlabelled is not eligible. The whole column
    is a read-time backfill in query.load_index, so a kernel parquet that lacks
    it was built by a bypassing path and its provenance is unknown.

cf. PR #4673 engine/neuralweb/edge_outcomes.py dst_outcome_unsigned_mfe_proxy.
The first batch is due 2026-10-01; this gate lands ahead of it.

P-VALUE: one-sided sign test on the count of positive signed outcomes vs H0=0.5.
  (Rational: the kernel cells store hit counts implicitly via wilson_ci_low, which
  was computed from hits/n_eff. We re-derive from the parquet columns: sign test
  p = P(Binomial(n_eff, 0.5) >= hits), one-sided. This is the simplest exact test
  appropriate for a hit-rate metric; it is distribution-free, makes no normality
  assumption, and is consistent with the qledger Wilson-CI machinery already used
  to compute wilson_ci_low in the first place. The BH family across ALL eligible
  cells controls FDR at alpha=0.10.)

FDR: Benjamini-Hochberg across ALL eligible cells as ONE family per batch.
  The trial ledger is populated with declared_budget = n_eligible BEFORE the
  p-values are computed. This enforces the anti-peeking order in code.

STANDING LAW (written into kernel_decisions.json):
  Only cells in survivors[] may EVER feed a behavior-changing consumer.
  Each consumer hookup additionally requires its own PR + registry event.

CADENCE GUARD:
  - Running before FIRST_BATCH_DUE exits 1 with a clear message.
  - --dry-run-on-fixtures <fixture_dir> accepts ONLY a filesystem path whose
    kernel_estimates.parquet is NOT byte-identical to the real production parquet
    (enforced by SHA-256 content hash, not just path equality — a byte-copy of
    the real parquet to a decoy path is rejected).

DRY-RUN ISOLATION:
  All dry-run writes (kernel_decisions.json and trial_ledger.jsonl) are
  redirected under <fixture_dir>/dry_run_scratch/ and NEVER touch the
  production artifact paths. This makes dry-run fully non-destructive.

ANTI-PEEKING ORDER (code-enforced, single function, no CLI flag to skip):
  Step 1: count eligible cells → N
  Step 2: register_trials(TRIAL_FAMILY, budget=N) [LEDGER WRITE BEFORE ANY PVALUE]
  Step 3: compute p-values
  Step 4: BH FDR
  Step 5: write kernel_decisions.json
