"""scripts/marketing_media_backfill.py — republish outbox chart images to R2.

WHY THIS EXISTS. A marketing post attaches a chart only when its outbox item
carries a PUBLIC https `media_url`: Buffer hosts no uploads, so the local
repo path is useless to it (scripts/marketing_publisher._media_paths_for skips
any non-http path). That URL is stamped exactly once, inside the nightly's
content_studio build, and ONLY if R2 creds were present in that process. Miss
that window — R2 hiccup, a build run outside Actions, creds not plumbed into a
lane — and the day's posts are permanently text-only. There was no way back:
the SVGs are committed but the PNGs are gitignored and the stamp never re-runs.

This is the way back. It walks the outbox for media entries with no public URL,
rebuilds the PNG from the COMMITTED SVG, uploads it to the same R2 key
content_studio would have used, and records the resulting URL in an append-only
sidecar the publisher reads as a fallback.

    # what is missing a URL (no network, no writes)
    python -m scripts.marketing_media_backfill --dry-run

    # rebuild + upload today's, then commit the sidecar
    R2_ENDPOINT=... R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=... R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=... R2_BUCKET=... \
        python -m scripts.marketing_media_backfill --as-of 2026-07-28

WHY A SIDECAR AND NOT AN items.jsonl REWRITE. items.jsonl is append-only and
outbox.fold_state keeps the FIRST row per id, so an appended "corrected" item is
silently ignored — the only way to stamp in place is a full-file rewrite, which
races the nightly and the publish sweeps that append to it concurrently. The
sidecar (data/marketing/outbox/media_urls.jsonl) is append-only like every other
ledger here, carries merge=union in .gitattributes, and is read last-row-wins so
a re-run simply supersedes. The item itself is never touched.

Fail-soft throughout (mirrors outbox.py / social_publisher.py): a chart that
cannot be rasterized or uploaded is REPORTED and skipped, never fatal — a
partial backfill is strictly better than none, and the post degrades to
text-only exactly as it does today.
