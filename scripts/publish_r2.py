"""Publish the heavy per-ticker site stores to Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible).

The daily/asia builds regenerate ~700 MB of per-ticker OHLC + search-library JSON.
Committing that to git bloats the history AND the GitHub-Pages deploy (approaching
Pages' 1 GB limit). Instead we sync those dirs to R2 (zero-egress object storage) and
the browser fetches them from `window.DATA_BASE` (see templates: dataUrl()).

Key layout mirrors the site path: site/ohlc/AAPL.json -> R2 key `ohlc/AAPL.json`, so
the client just prepends DATA_BASE. Content-hash skip (compare local md5 to the R2
ETag) means unchanged files aren't re-uploaded — most daily runs push only the deltas.

Resilient by design: no-op (exit 0) when the R2_* creds are absent, like the other
builders. Reads: R2_ENDPOINT, R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID, R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, R2_BUCKET.
A single file's terminal upload failure (after boto's own retries) is logged and
counted instead of aborting the run — the md5/ETag delta pass self-heals it next
run; the process still exits 1 (plus a ::warning line) so lanes see the miss.
The connection pool is SIZED from the worker count (_pool_size): each worker's
upload_file fans out to _TRANSFER_CONCURRENCY part uploads on GB-class files, so
a flat pool starves the multipart lanes and the resulting TLS churn fails parts
outright — which then holds the manifest guard shut night after night.

Partial-tree invocations MUST pass --no-manifest: the manifest is rebuilt from the
local tree, so a checkout holding only a dir's few git-committed files (the heavy
store is R2-only) would replace the full ~5000-name manifest with a 2-name one —
and bulk consumers prune against it. A guard blocks any manifest that shrinks the
remote list by more than half (--force-manifest overrides for intentional culls).

`<dir>/_manifest.json` is a PUBLISH-SIDE key, written only by that end-of-run put.
A data-dir store's own collector-written _manifest.json is a DIFFERENT document that
merely shares the name, so _uploadable keeps it out of the delta pass (it rides to R2
embedded under "store" instead). Without that exclusion the key held two documents per
run, --no-manifest silently replaced it anyway, and audit_r2's freshness anchor stayed
warm on nights the publisher's put never happened.

Append-only stores (_APPEND_ONLY_DIRS, e.g. attention/) additionally refuse per-file
uploads SMALLER than the R2 object: when the fetch_r2 restore fails, the collector
rebuilds the same ~966 filenames as real-but-short files, so a runner tree can pass
the min-files guard yet must never clobber the deep-history objects. The per-dir
total-bytes floor (_DATA_DIR_MIN_BYTES) is a SEPARATE fence keyed only on _DATA_DIRS
— stores that legitimately rewrite whole files (price_pressure) take it without the
per-file one, and it also covers the empty-remote case the per-file guard has no
remote size to compare against. Restore the download leg with scripts/fetch_r2.

Usage: python -m scripts.publish_r2 [--dirs ohlc,stockdata,...] [--dry-run]
                                    [--no-manifest] [--force-manifest]

# so the floor is 5 — "all four roots AND the manifest". 4 would have passed a
# three-roots-plus-manifest tree, which is precisely the partial rebuild this guard is
# for; the count is a whole-store floor, not a parquet count.
# price_pressure is 3: latest.json + base_rates.json + events.parquet — "both tracked

# JSON (the parquet is gitignored and restored from R2), which is exactly 2, so 3 is
# the line between a restored store and a bare checkout. The count alone cannot stay
# that sharp forever — completion_receipts.jsonl is tracked too and appears the first
# night the §10.1 pass files one, which would make a bare checkout 3 files — so the
# bytes floor below (not the count) is the fence that survives that: a sidecars-only

# collect job materialises the store via scripts/fetch_r2 BEFORE the wiki_pageviews
# collector upserts its ~120d window, then publishes back (gated on the restore step's
# outcome — see daily.yml). If that restore silently failed, the collector rebuilds
# all ~966 filenames as real-but-SHORT files that sail past _DATA_DIR_MIN_FILES, so
# two more fences catch the shape:
#  - per FILE, a changed file uploads only when the local object is at least as
#    large as the remote one (_APPEND_ONLY_DIRS);
#  - per DIR, the whole tree is refused when its total bytes sit under the floor
#    (_DATA_DIR_MIN_BYTES: shallow ~120d rebuild ≈7 MB vs deep store ≈45 MB) —
#    this also covers the empty-remote case the per-file guard can't compare against.
# Deliberately NOT in DEFAULT_DIRS: only the collect job's gated lane (or a host-side
# ATTENTION_STORE publish) touches it.
# index_gex_history is the SAME shape as attention: a deep-history store (2017->, one
# parquet per index root) whose only producer is a host-bound job, so R2 holds the sole
# offsite copy of ~10 years of reconstruction. A truncated rebuild (a mid-write
# _backfill_state.json, one unreadable year) yields a valid-but-short parquet, so it gets
# both of attention's fences as well: per FILE, refuse an upload smaller than the R2
# object; per DIR, refuse a tree under the bytes floor. The four parquets measure ~210 KB
# each (~846 KB with the manifest), so 600 KB is the floor a genuine store clears and a
# one-or-two-root rebuild does not. The builder's own shrink guard is the first fence;
# these are the ones that survive a builder bypass.
#
# price_pressure takes the DIR fence only, NOT the per-file one (it is not in
# _APPEND_ONLY_DIRS): its single parquet is rewritten whole every night and may
# legitimately land a few bytes smaller after a re-grade, so a per-file shrink refusal
# would block honest nights. The dir floor still separates the two shapes cleanly —
# a bare checkout's tracked sidecars are ~73 KB, the seeded store is ~11.4 MB — so
# 4 MB refuses a sidecars-only tree (with or without a receipts file) while leaving
# ~65% of headroom for any plausible recompression. The append-only history fence is
# not the right tool here; the builder's ledger.restore_status freshness gate is, and

    (/Users/chriswong/theta-ops-wt/data/thetadata_eod) holds `_manifest.json` and
    `_backfill_state.json` as real files, while the three tier dirs `eod/`, `oi/`
    and `greeks/` are symlinks into /Volumes/STORAGE/macro-data/thetadata_eod/.
    rglob therefore enumerated 2 files, `_uploadable` dropped the store manifest,

    shown; the enumeration was what lied to it, so the fix belongs here and the

    symlinks to follow and still counts 2 files.

    Paths come back as LOGICAL paths under `base`, never resolved: the R2 key is
    `p.relative_to(base)`, so resolving eod/SPY/2020.parquet to its /Volumes/…
    target would both raise out of relative_to and rewrite every key.

    Termination is guaranteed: a directory is walked at most once, keyed by
    (st_dev, st_ino), so a symlink loop cannot spin forever. That also means an
    aliased tree (two symlinks onto one real directory) is enumerated once rather
    than uploaded twice under two keys — logged, never silent, because the skip
    would otherwise be an invisible hole in a publish. Unreadable or broken

    store content — it is the INPUT `_manifest_doc` embeds under "store", and its R2
    key (`<dir>/_manifest.json`) is the very key the publish-side file-list doc is put
    to at the end of the run. Uploading it in the delta pass made that one key hold two
    different documents in the same run, with three consequences:

      * on any run with an upload failure the publisher's put is skipped, so the RAW
        collector doc is what remains on R2 — top-level `store`/`n_roots`/`per_root`,
        not `dir`/`count`/`files`. That is the state observed live on 2026-07-30:
        `Last-Modified` 05:02:56Z, written by the delta pass 1s after
        `_backfill_state.json`, while the SPY parquets landed 05:04-05:12Z;
      * that upload REFRESHED the key's Last-Modified, which is audit_r2's freshness
        anchor — so a night whose manifest put never happened still read FRESH;
      * `_remote_manifest` (the shrink guard's input) then read a doc with no `count`,
        making `_manifest_ok` vacuously true for every data dir.

    Nothing is lost: `_manifest_doc` embeds the collector doc under "store". fetch_r2
    already skips `_manifest.json` keys on the download leg for the mirror-image reason
    (it is a publish-side artifact) — this is the upload half of that same contract.
    Site dirs have no collector manifest and are returned unfiltered.

    (AD-1T1 §B/F15) `_writer.lock` (the T1 store's crash-safe advisory flock
    file) is excluded the same way — it is local writer-coordination state,
    never store content, and uploading it would let a stale lock byte ride to
    R2 with no reader for it.

    (RF9, R3) ANY `.tmp`-suffixed name is excluded too — a SIGKILL mid-write
