"""scripts.close_pass_slo_report — the evening board's acceptance record (W-L1, PR-C).

THE INSTRUMENT THE GATE IS GRADED WITH
======================================
The W-L1 gate is "fresh US picks live on the site by 18:30 ET, five consecutive
sessions". ``scripts/freshness_sentinel.py`` measures that and files one
append-only stamp per (session, surface) in ``<state-dir>/first_fresh.json``.
This reads that record back as a table a human can accept or reject a wave on.

A PASS/FAIL ON ONE DEADLINE IS NOT AN ACCEPTANCE RECORD. Fri 2026-08-14 is the
case that forced this: the board published at 23:19:14Z — 19:19 ET, against an
18:30 SLA and a 16:15 product target — with 22 cards from 253 evaluated names of
a 1,763 universe. "MISSED" is the whole of what the record could say. It could
not say whether the 49 minutes went into waiting for closes, into the pass
itself, or into the gap between publishing and a reader being able to see it,
and those three have three different owners and three different fixes.

So every row here decomposes the evening into legs that add up:

    close_observed_at ──close_to_candidate──▶ board_generated_at
                       ──candidate_to_visible──▶ first_user_visible_at

WHAT IS MEASURED AND WHAT IS ONLY READ
  * ``sla_met`` is READ from the record, never recomputed. The stamp is
    append-only and "when did this FIRST read fresh" has exactly one answer; a
    report that recomputed it would be free to disagree with the thing being
    accepted, and the report is not the authority.
  * ``product_slo_met`` is COMPUTED here from the recorded instant, because the
    16:15 ET product target is this report's question and not the sentinel's.
    Moving that target must not require re-stamping history.
  * Every absent field prints ``—``. Never 0, never a blank, never an inferred
    value: an unmeasured leg and a zero-length leg are different claims, and
    only one of them is ever true here.
  * ``candidate_to_visible_sec`` is bounded below by the sentinel's own 30-minute
    cadence. The record publishes that bound as ``visible_resolution_sec`` and
    this report prints it in the legend rather than dressing the number up as
    second-precision knowledge.

A SESSION WITH NO STAMP IS A ROW, NOT A GAP. Rows are walked over the NYSE
calendar (``lib.nyse_calendar``), exactly as ``freshness_sentinel.sla_streak``
does, so an evening on which the board never published prints as a full row of
``—`` and a MISSED verdict. Iterating the record's own keys would step straight
over the miss and report a five-session acceptance that never happened — the
gate passing on the strength of its own missing data.

THE BOOTSTRAP LEG — "is the code that fires the clock the code we merged?"
The lane's launchd clock does NOT run this repository. It runs a SNAPSHOT that
``scripts/install_closepass_launchd.sh`` froze into Application Support, and the
freeze is deliberate (a mid-day push to main must not change what the clock
executes). The cost of that design is that a merged fix is not a deployed fix,
and on 2026-08-18 nothing in the estate could see the difference: PR #5862 merged
as af416e4a1066 while the host kept executing the pre-fix bytes from Aug 15, and
its receipts looked perfect because the only vintage they compared to anything
was the LANE's — which is reset to origin/main every run and is therefore always
fresh no matter how old the file computing it is.

So every receipt now carries a ``bootstrap`` verdict and this report grades it:

  * the column is per session — history, printed and never re-graded.
  * the EXIT CODE follows the NEWEST session that has a receipt, because the
    question is "will tonight's fire run origin/main", and only the newest
    receipt answers it. Grading the whole window would hold a healed host red
    for a week and teach everyone to ignore the column.
  * a receipt whose ``schema`` predates this checkout's is itself DRIFT and is
    reported as such: the bootstrap that wrote it is provably older than the
    code being read here. That is the merged-but-not-deployed detector.
  * no receipt is ``—`` and says so in the footer, naming the directory it read.
    "I could not look" never renders as "nothing is wrong".

Usage:
  python -m scripts.close_pass_slo_report                     # last 5 sessions
  python -m scripts.close_pass_slo_report --sessions 10
  python -m scripts.close_pass_slo_report --json              # machine-readable
  python -m scripts.close_pass_slo_report --with-r2           # + tonight's board
  python -m scripts.close_pass_slo_report --state-dir ./state --now 2026-08-15T10:00Z
  python -m scripts.close_pass_slo_report --receipts-dir ~/Library/Application\\ Support/macro-closepass/runs

Exit status: 0 when every reported session met BOTH gates AND the newest host
receipt shows no bootstrap drift, 1 when any did not, 2 when the report could not
be built at all (no calendar, unreadable record) — "I could not measure" must
never share an exit code with "it passed".
