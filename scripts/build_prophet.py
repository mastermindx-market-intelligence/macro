"""scripts/build_prophet.py — Prophet Origination Bridge + artifact publisher (W1).

Reads us_standouts.json, originates prophet.trade_plan/v1 envelopes,
runs the management confidence engine for every active plan, and writes:

    site/prophet/index.json          — every plan the management engine could state,
                                       with its state inline.  NOTE THE MISNOMER:
                                       `active_count` and `plans[]` include plans that
                                       have CLOSED in the forward ledger (16 of 74 on
                                       2026-08-03).  That population is fixed — several
                                       downstream consumers read it — so W1 added
                                       `open_count` (the live subset) and a per-plan
                                       `closed` flag instead of redefining it.  A closed
                                       plan's `pulse` says "closed · <outcome>" and never
                                       narrates its still-updating phase/human_state.
    site/prophet/plans/<ID>.json     — per-plan artifact
    site/prophet/states/<ID>.json    — per-state artifact
    site/prophet/showcase.json       — public landing teaser: DELAYED winning
                                       calls from the board ledger, never the
                                       live board (templates/index.html
                                       #f-prophet; also --showcase-only)
    data/prophet/ledger.jsonl        — forward outcome ledger (INITIALIZED here;
                                       nightly is the SOLE future advancer)

R2 publication is deliberately unavailable from this builder.  The daily workflow
first commits the exact build-owned delta under Git authority, then conditionally
publishes that accepted checkpoint with provenance metadata.

Usage
-----
    python -m scripts.build_prophet [--date YYYY-MM-DD]

Environment variables
---------------------
    THETADATA_STORE        Path to ThetaData EOD store root (optional)

SCHEDULING NOTE
---------------
NO daily.yml wiring in this PR.  Scheduling follows after operator reviews
the first output.  This script is safe to run manually at any time; it is
idempotent (duplicate plans are suppressed by ID).

AUTHORITY NOTE
--------------
All output artifacts carry authority_tier='display'.  No signal, score, or
escalation originates from an LLM in this pipeline.  The word "validated"
is forbidden in site artifacts (enforced by check_validated_claims.py).

# ── SNAPSHOT COPY SANITIZERS (the 2026-08-11 landing breach) ─────────────────────────
#
# Board snapshots are FOSSILS. data/us_board_ledger/snapshots.jsonl stores the exact bytes
# of a board as it read on its own date — that is the point of a point-in-time ledger, and
# it is why the ledger is deliberately NOT rewritten when copy changes in live code. The
# consequence: copy that engine/stock_score.py stopped emitting months ago is still replayed
# by every card built from an old snapshot.
#
# WHAT SHIPPED. `derive_showcase_card` folded `conviction.cautions` / `cautions_zh` into the
# card's flags VERBATIM. A fossilised caution pair —
#   "… is below its long-term trend — validated drawdown gate: size down …"
#   "…已跌破长期趋势 — 已验证的回撤门槛：减小仓位。"
# — rode that fold into site/prophet/showcase.json, which §4b bakes into the anonymous
# landing page's one-line `<script id="ph-data">` island. Four claim pairs were live on
# templates/index.html + site/index.html with BC-2 reading green, because a `"note":` key
# elsewhere on that 23k-char line suppressed the whole island (fixed in the same change).
#
# WHY PHRASE REWRITES FIRST. The engine's own _sanitize_thesis_text maps the bare token to
# "risk gate", which reads correctly inside "validated risk gate: trim" but would turn
# "validated drawdown gate" into "risk gate drawdown gate". These two phrases are what the
# board actually fossilised, so they get an exact replacement that keeps the sentence's
# meaning — the gate is MEASURED, which is true and says nothing about promotion — and the
# bridge sanitizers then catch anything a future fossil carries that these do not name.

    THE CLOCK IS ``entry_date``, NOT ``signal_date`` (P1, 2026-08-06)
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    Legacy ``signal_date`` values were formation anchors and could precede the plan's
    publication by months; tier-aware values are causal T1/T2 event closes. Neither is
    the entry-price/grading clock. Scanning from the legacy alias graded plans on bars
    that PREDATED them: every EXPIRED row in the shipped ledger and both winners closed
    before their plan existed, and 14 plans were born already past horizon. The scan
    start AND horizon expiry now both read :func:`plan_clock_date` — the evidenced
    ``price_basis_date``/``entry_date`` whose close supplied ``entry``. Plan identity is
    separately frozen by ``formation_date``.

    THE TRIGGER IS READ (P2, 2026-08-06)
    ------------------------------------
    The plan's own copy says "No position until trigger is confirmed", and this
    function used to ignore ``plan["trigger"]`` entirely — 5 of 16 shipped rows
    booked full P&L on positions the plan never told a reader to take.  The
    outcome scan now starts at the first close at-or-through the trigger (>= for
    BULL, <= for BEAR) at or after the clock start.  A plan whose trigger is never
    confirmed inside the horizon closes ``NO_ENTRY`` with ``stock_result_pct=None``
    and is excluded from BOTH the numerator and the denominator wherever rates are
    computed — it is not a loss, it is a trade that never happened.
    ``trigger is None`` means "no trigger condition" and is treated as confirmed on
    the clock start (legacy plans and fixtures predate the field).

    Close triggers (in priority order), scanned from the CONFIRMATION bar onward:
      1. INVALIDATED   — any close <= invalidation (BULL)
      2. T2_HIT        — any close >= T2
      3. T1_HIT        — any close >= T1 (and T2 not yet hit)
      4. EXPIRED       — days since the clock start >= horizon_days
      5. NO_ENTRY      — horizon reached with the trigger never confirmed

    DESIGN (first-trigger-closes): the loop breaks on the FIRST trigger hit and
    records that outcome permanently.  A plan that touches T1 then later T2 is
    recorded as T1_HIT only.  T2_HIT fires only when the price clears T2 without
    a prior close >= T1 (i.e., a gap day that skips T1).  This is intentional:
    the ledger records first-observable-close outcomes, not eventual maximum reach.
    Ledger consumers must not read T2_HIT frequency as "ever reached T2" — it
    reflects "cleared T2 in a single close without a prior T1 close."

    PIT correctness: `after = price_history_pit[index > clock_ts]` uses strict
    greater-than so the entry day's own close is excluded (it IS the entry price).
    If the PIT frame ends before entry_date + horizon_days, the plan stays open
    indefinitely — this is correct behaviour, not a missed-expiry bug.

    Stock result = (close_price_on_close_date / entry - 1) * 100 (%).  The
    entry-fill convention for a TRIGGERED plan is unchanged (pre-registered
    territory): P&L is still measured from the plan's stated ``entry``.
    Option result = null (premium-mark data not available in this pipeline).

    OURS (nightly-only; PIT-safe): we scan daily closes on the price_history_pit
    frame (already filtered to <= asof by the caller).  The first day a close
    crosses a trigger is the close_date for that trigger.  This is conservative
    (may miss intraday crosses) and documented here as a display-tier limitation.

    one row the first time a plan hits INVALIDATED / T1_HIT / T2_HIT / EXPIRED, and
    ``_load_closed_ids`` reads that file back.  No new store is introduced — this reads
    the plans dict and the ledger this pipeline already loads, and a plan that closes
    frees its ticker+direction slot for a fresh origination.

    "Open" is not "present in the plans dict" either: an audit-quarantined plan
    (``integrity_status == "quarantined"`` in the append-only correction overlay) is
    withdrawn from display and, in the published index's own words, cannot emit live
    instructions or ledger rows — so it does not hold a ticker+direction slot, and a
    later bake may lawfully re-originate the name.  The exclusion lives HERE, not in a
    caller, because this is the one definition of "open" that both the originator and
    the duplicate-open-key census must read; when the caller owned it they drifted, and
    the census read three lawfully re-originated pairs (FCX / HEI / MDB, freed by the
    2026-08-08 chronology audit) as duplicates.  Same-ID suppression is untouched, so
    identity never forks.

    Timing (deliberate, one-night lag): origination runs BEFORE this run's
    ``advance_ledger`` call, so a plan whose exit is being written tonight still blocks
    tonight and frees the slot tomorrow.  The lag errs toward NOT re-originating a name
    whose close is in flight, which is the conservative direction.

    Cross-check on the 2026-08-03 artifacts: every plan whose management state reads
    ``phase == "invalidated"`` (QCOM ×2, MS, COIN) already carries a ledger row, so the
    ledger is a sufficient closure authority here and a second, divergeable one is not

    still gets the legs it does have, and a plan with nothing readable returns ``("", "")``
    rather than a half-built string.  DATA ONLY — W2 owns how (and whether) this renders.

    returns ``("closed · stopped out", "已结 · 止损离场")`` and reads NEITHER phase nor
    human_state.  Both keep updating for a closed plan (the management engine states
    every plan in the index), so a closed plan would otherwise pulse "46d · window
    elapsed · window elapsed — awaiting close" as though the thesis were still running.
    That is not hypothetical: ``overtime`` is reachable on a live-priced plan ONLY after
    the closure scan has already graded it (§13.3), so suppressing the phase leg here is
    what keeps a post-closure phase off the surface.  The age leg is dropped too — any
    age on a dead plan grows forever and reads as duration-still-open.  Both ages stay

    # whose default branch is "allow" is a guard only the test suite ever exercises
    # (the #5000 shape).  The writer then re-checks the process lane itself, so a caller
    # that claims nightly in a render or intraday process still writes nothing.

    # `existing_plans.keys()` rather than `existing_ids`: originate_plans MUTATES the
