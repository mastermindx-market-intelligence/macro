"""P0.1 Production Replay Harness — Entry Intelligence Program §4/P0.1.

Replays the actual production signal stack (signal_gate → confluence cascade →
mtf_alignment → extension/knife) over the full yahoo price store (2012→present)
and grades every candidate verdict under species law.

Design contract (masterplan §4/P0.1):
  1. Vectorised candidate prefilter (any relevant cross within trailing ~10 bars)
     → full production-code evaluation only on candidates.
  2. Prefilter soundness positive control: ≥500 random non-candidate (ticker,date)
     pairs must all return non-fire from the production gate; any fire = halt.
  3. Log EVERY candidate verdict: fire (tier/sub/weight), near-miss (reason),
     rejection (taxonomy reason) + frozen study features at signal time.
  4. Grade every row under species law: terminal-state partition
     (STOPPED/DEAD_MONEY/CUSHIONED/CLEAN_LIFTOFF), MAE/MFE, horizons
     5/10/21/63/126d, entry strictly-after signal bar.
  5. Golden test: latest date in the price store → run production gate per ticker
     → diff against replay logged verdicts for that date (exact match required).
  6. Window: 2012→present, per-year chunked + resumable parquet parts.
     Pre-2015 rows stamped survivor_bias=True.
  7. PIT discipline everywhere: see per-block comments with "PIT:".

Study features frozen at signal time (§4 list):
  - ext_z: price/SMA200 z-score vs own 252d history (engine/extension.py)
  - ext_atr: price-to-200dma in ATR units (approximated from daily returns)
  - knife_z: falling-knife severity (distance below 200dma / own volatility)
  - align_tier: PRIME/ARMED/APPROACHING from mtf_alignment()
  - align_quality: 0-100 quality score from mtf_alignment()
  - weekly_phase: weekly MACD phase (rising/falling/basing/etc.)
  - above_200: bool, price > 200-day SMA
  - rs_sector_quartile: RS vs sector close (1=bottom, 4=top quartile)
  - sector: string sector label (loaded from us_standouts.json)
  - dist_to_52wh: distance from 52-week high (negative = below high)
  - adv_dollar_21d: 21-day average daily dollar volume
  - washout_proximity: cohort washout proximity (bool: within washout window)

Threshold sources (docstring):
  - STOP_BARRIER, CUSHION_BARRIER, LIFTOFF_15, LIFTOFF_8: engine/grading.py
    (pre-registered constants from the Outcome Spine v2 spec §1.1)
  - FRESH_TICKS (=2): engine/confluence_tiers.py — freshness window for T1/T2
  - SPINE_HORIZONS (5,10,21,63,126): engine/grading.py
  - terminal_state partition logic: engine/grading.py terminal_state()
  - REJECTION_TAXONOMY: engine/grading.py REJECTION_TAXONOMY (closed set)
  - Prefilter lookback: 10 bars (≈ FRESH_TICKS × 5 on 2D grid), matching the
    confluence_tiers.CONF_W window of 8 bars plus 2-bar freshness window
  - survivor_bias True for pre-2015: masterplan §4/P0.1 — "pre-2015 rows carry
    survivor-bias stamp until P0.2 says otherwise"

    ── Why not a lossy close-only prefilter (audit F1, resolved this session) ──
    The production gate fires on the PROVISIONAL basis: it re-anchors the final,
    INCOMPLETE 3D/2D resample bucket onto the truncation bar. A T1 `ticks=0` fire
    therefore exists ONLY when the series is truncated exactly at that bar — it is
    an artifact of the partial-bucket computation that has NO counterpart in any
    FULL-series indicator stream. This was proven FOUR ways, each of which drops
    real gate fires the exhaustive recall assertion then caught:
      1. tier_stream(full)                 — misses 8/24 ZS fires
      2. resample phase-shift union        — misses ZS 2024-05-10 (0/3 phases)
      3. resampled cross events ±dilated    — misses AA 2023-05-22 (18-bar drift)
      4. daily momentum-turn net @97% cov  — misses 15/1140 cohort fires
    No close-only heuristic is a guaranteed superset of the provisional-basis fire
    set. The ONLY recall-complete candidate set is every bar (the gate is then the
    detector). The old prefilter's silent recall loss (audit F1) is thus removed
    by construction: candidate ⊇ every fire, trivially.

    The lossy fast-path net survives as prefilter_candidates_fast() for

        brake would demote it. (build_stock_library ~L1246 extension read.)

        knife block (a["knife"] ≥ _ALIGN_KNIFE_BLOCK) — excluded from the trend
        lane. (build_stock_library ~L1973.)

    ── F6/F7 HONEST SCOPE (do not overclaim) ──────────────────────────────────
    The FULL board buy list is NOT reproducible from this harness, and the task's
    own done-check permits reporting why. The shipped us_standouts.json buy list
    is produced by build_stock_library.py L1900-2083 from:
      • stock_score.conviction_profile() → composite_z  (needs event-edge/PEAD,
        quality, tailwind axes + a CROSS-SECTIONAL attach_panel_scores over the
        whole universe — not a per-ticker close-only PIT quantity),
      • entry_signal.assess() → entry_z / alignment,
      • coiled_by cohort-washout bonus, cycle_blocked, ladder.state, Lane-R.
    None of these are derivable from a close-only PIT slice, so the harness CANNOT
