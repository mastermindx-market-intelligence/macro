"""Materialize the GMI theme graph — nodes, edges, evidence (masterplan §4.1, W1b).

TWO MODES.

``--backfill`` (one-shot, era=reconstruction)
    Builds the whole graph from the live membership documents, the crosswalk and the
    THS concept map, and stamps every row ``era="reconstruction"`` with ``belief_time``
    = the run's own date. It refuses to run over a populated edge store unless
    ``--force-backfill`` is passed: a second reconstruction would append a whole
    duplicate history under a new belief_time and make the store's own diff meaningless.

default (nightly, era=observed)
    Recomputes tonight's view, diffs it against the stored latest-belief view, and
    appends ONLY what changed. Lane-gated: ledger writes require ``COLLECT_LANE=nightly``
    (fail-closed, defaultless). Off-lane the whole computation still runs and its
    summary is logged — a render lane computes and discards, exactly like every other
    ledger here.

Both modes also re-derive the CAPABILITY side-car (W3A §9.3) — never a node column,
because node rows are write-once and a capability written onto one would be a ratchet
that outlived every later substrate improvement — and both pass through the source-family
SHRINK WALL: a build that would close more than a quarter of a family's live memberships
refuses unless ``--allow-source-shrink <family>`` says the restructure is real. That wall
sits on the write path rather than the refresh path on purpose: a hand-edited input never
goes near a refresh run, and in an append-only store its closures are permanent.

Non-fatal by construction: this is a display-tier product data plane (all six synapse
authority booleans false). A failure here degrades context, never a decision, so the
nightly step must not take the collect lane down with it.

Run: python -m scripts.build_theme_graph [--backfill] [--force-backfill]
