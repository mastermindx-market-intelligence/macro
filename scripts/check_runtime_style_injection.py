"""TP-0 Task 2 — ratchet runtime stylesheet-injection debt in user-facing JS.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `scripts/check_design_system.py` scans `templates/` only,
deliberately (its closure contract names exactly one path literal and makes
no subprocess call — see that module's docstring). A page composer under
`site/` can therefore obey the design system in templates while building a
parallel, ungoverned presentation layer entirely inside runtime JS strings
(`el.style.textContent = "..."`, `document.createElement('style')`,
`<style>...</style>` markup baked into a template literal, or a raw
`document.styleSheets[0].insertRule(...)`). That is the enforcement escape hatch this guard
closes. It is a SEPARATE script, on purpose: widening check_design_system.py
to cover `site/` too would break its one-root/no-subprocess closure law.

WHAT IT DOES. Scans every `.js` file under `templates/` and `site/` for four
injection signatures (PATTERNS below) and compares the counts against a
frozen baseline (`config/runtime_style_injection_allowlist.json`). TP-0 does
not remove any existing injection — it only FREEZES the current debt so it
cannot silently grow:

  * a file that injects but is ABSENT from the baseline is a hard fail (a
    brand-new opaque runtime stylesheet);
  * a file whose actual count EXCEEDS its pinned per-pattern allowance is a
    hard fail (more debt added to an already-known offender);
  * a file whose actual count is LOWER than its pinned allowance — including a
    file that dropped OUT of injection entirely while its baseline entry
    survives — is ALSO a hard fail (R2, binding deviation from the original
    TP-0 plan wording, which called for an ignorable `::notice`): the ratchet
    only ever tightens, and an ignorable notice cannot deliver that — nothing
    stops the SAME stale allowance from being quietly re-inflated by a later
    PR with no finding at all. The fix is always the same PR: regenerate the
    baseline with `--emit-baseline --generated-from <sha>`.

`theme.js` (both `templates/` and `site/`) is the canonical theme owner the
architecture explicitly permits and is, by a wide margin, the single biggest
entry in the baseline — that is expected and is not debt TP-0 is asking
anyone to remove. Vendored minified libraries (e.g. `plotly-2.32.0.min.js`)
are IN SCOPE and frozen like anything else: no vendor exemption class is
carved out, because an exemption class is exactly the bypass shape this guard
exists to close. A future vendor upgrade that changes its injection count is
expected to require a visible baseline update — that is the intended ratchet
behavior, not a false positive.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check_runtime_style_injection.py
        # scan the committed tree against the committed baseline; exit 1 on
        # any new/absent/over-budget file OR any stale (over-allowed) budget —
        # R2: the ratchet only ever tightens, so stale allowances fail the
        # build too, not just notice it
    python3 scripts/check_runtime_style_injection.py --emit-baseline \\
        --generated-from "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" > config/runtime_style_injection_allowlist.json
        # regenerate the baseline from the CURRENT tree. --generated-from is
        # REQUIRED and is never guessed or substituted by this script — the
        # caller supplies the real commit sha (read-only `git rev-parse`).
    python3 scripts/check_runtime_style_injection.py --selftest
        # exercise the gate against planted fixtures; exit 0 on success

Exit codes: 0 = clean (or --emit-baseline / --selftest succeeded) · 1 =
new/absent/over-budget injection found, a stale allowance found, or the
baseline file could not be read · 2 = --emit-baseline invoked without
--generated-from.
