"""International bridge — the pluggable CLAIM validation harness (W1, masterplan §4.2).

ONE harness, ONE trial-budget family, HARD gates. It does NOT reinvent the anti-overfit
stack — it COMPOSES it:

  * multiple-testing:  engine/trial_ledger.py family "intl_bridge" — the FULL C1-C8
                       claim×horizon grid is logged AT GENERATION (`--declare`), so the
                       Deflated-Sharpe haircut deflates by the honest count (the forex
                       declared-N=60 discipline, ported).
  * core verdict:      engine/promotion_gate.promotion_gate(family="intl_bridge",
                       dsr_min=0.90) — DSR + PBO + CPCV + drift, advisory.
  * intl-specific gates the promotion gate does NOT cover, built on engine/validation.py:
      a. ORTHOGONALITY  — residual forward-DD-reduction / residual IC AFTER partialing
                          out the existing US MRS legs + cross-asset RORO + hk_global_beta
                          (validation.resid_z / cross_sectional_resid). Adds nothing
                          orthogonal → FAILS.
      b. CRISIS-COUNT N — block-bootstrap-by-crisis + leave-one-crisis-out; BOTH the
                          daily-row CI (validation.block_bootstrap_ci) and the crisis-count
                          result are stored; weight_cap scales with independent-bear count.
      c. CRISIS-INDEP.  — positive expected-shortfall reduction after row-deleting the top-3
         EXPECTED-       drawdown windows; else the claim is labelled `crisis_only`.
         SHORTFALL
      d. LEAD-LAG KERNEL— for any cross-market claim: HAC-t (validation.newey_west_tstat) +
                          BH-FDR (validation.benjamini_hochberg) across the ENTIRE declared
                          grid + split-half same-sign (cross-asset-leadlag-phase0 method).
      e. FRESHNESS      — refuse to grade a claim whose source_series violate their SLA on
                          disk (fail-closed; a stale critical series zeroes the leg).

Verdict grammar (ported from calibrate_forex): CONFIRMED / DIRECTIONAL / CONTEXT / INVERTED
/ PENDING. Three-state weight policy (§4.1): CONFIRMED → measured weight_cap; DIRECTIONAL →
half, de-risk-direction-only; CONTEXT/INVERTED/PENDING → 0.

Emits data/intl_bridge/ledger.json (the exact schema engine/intl_feed.py — the sibling
Layer-2 reader — consumes). --backfill encodes the already-run evidence (engine/intl_claims
.BACKFILL) so the registry starts truthful. This harness does NOT wire anything into scorers
(that is W2, with measured weights).

Run:
  .venv/bin/python -m scripts.intl_phase0 --declare        # register the C1-C8 trial grid
  .venv/bin/python -m scripts.intl_phase0 --backfill       # write the truthful starting ledger
  .venv/bin/python -m scripts.intl_phase0 --run            # grade claims with a live builder
  .venv/bin/python -m scripts.intl_phase0 --declare --backfill   # the W1 kickoff (both)
