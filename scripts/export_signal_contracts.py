"""Export cross-repo signal contracts as DATA (audit #7 #9 #45) → site/factordata/contracts/.

The dashboard is the ORACLE. It exports two artifacts the Terminal and bot consume as a
conformance check — so a stale fork FAILS and a correct engine PASSES (the inversion of
the old golden_gate, which self-checked a known-wrong reference):

  1. golden_signals.json — for NVDA + one A-share + one HK name: an inputs-hash and the
     expected BUY/SELL/tier sequence over a FIXED historical window, computed from the
     dashboard's CORRECTED confluence math (engine.canon.confluence_signals: session-
     grouped 3D resample, adjust=False EMA, SMA-seeded RMA). The Terminal reproduces the
     sequence from the same close series; any mismatch means its math drifted (#7).

  2. artifact_manifest.json — {artifact, expected_max_age in TRADING-CALENDAR days} for the
     handoff files the Terminal and bot read (stock JSONs, us/china standouts, regime
     timelines). The consumer fails-CLOSED on genuine staleness (per-artifact cadence)
     without halting on benign weekend/holiday lag (#9).

The window is FIXED (start/end pinned) so the exported sequence is deterministic and the
contract is reproducible across repos and reruns. Never raises on a missing symbol —
it is skipped with a logged warning.

# ── artifact manifest ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# expected_max_age is in TRADING-CALENDAR days: an artifact older than this (excluding
# weekends/holidays) is genuinely stale and the consumer must abstain. A weekend-only
# lag is NOT stale (the cadence is trading-day-aware on the consumer side).
#
# R4 contract governance (NW Rails PR-7):
#   schema_version  — semver string; bump minor when fields are added (backwards-compatible),
#                     bump major when fields are removed or renamed (breaking change).
#   schema_fields   — sorted list of ALWAYS-PRESENT (required) top-level JSON keys.
#                     For list-valued artifacts where kind implies items (e.g. board),
#                     schema_item_fields lists the item-level keys (buy[] / reduce[] items).
#                     scripts/check_contract_drift.py compares these against the live artifact
#                     and exits nonzero on divergence — use --warn-only during the ratchet
#                     period, then flip to hard-fail after one clean week (see that script).
#   optional_fields — sorted list of CONDITIONAL top-level keys the builder emits only when
#                     a data condition holds (present some nights, absent others by design).
#                     Documented for consumers but EXCLUDED from drift (present-or-absent is
#                     fine); a conditional field belongs here, NOT in schema_fields, or it
#                     flaps the drift lane red↔green with the data. A key in NEITHER list is
#                     undocumented and still trips `added` drift. An ITEM-level key that is
#                     emitted on only one of an artifact's arrays (us_standouts `anchor`,
#                     ran[] rows only) may also be registered here as the contract's
#                     may-be-absent notice to consumers — check_contract_drift reads
#                     top-level keys only, so this exempts nothing it would otherwise catch.
#   Per-wildcard artifacts (per_stock_intel, per_stock_signal): schema is derived from a
#   representative sample; all files in the same kind share the schema.
#
# Consumer-registry vocabulary:
#   bot:*       — the autonomous trading bot (bot.mastermind-x.com :8001, Brain BOT VPS
#                 mirror). Reads artifacts at intraday cadence. A stale or schema-drifted
#                 artifact causes the bot to abstain (fail-closed per audit #9). Known
#                 consumers: bot:conviction, bot:lenses, bot:strategist, bot:macro_risk,
#                 bot:china_book, bot:canada_book, bot:hk_book.
#   terminal:*  — the Mastermind Terminal (app.mastermind-x.com, Next.js SaaS). Reads
#                 artifacts for display and chart markers. Known consumers:
#                 terminal:pull_macro_intel (stock intel bridge), terminal:chart_markers
#                 (BUY/SELL/tier markers overlay), terminal:screener (US board candidates),
#                 terminal:regime_banner (macro regime display strip).

    # anchored at all rather than rendering an age derived from the tick count, so
    # a present row's `sessions_since` is trustworthy and `anchor` says how much.
    # `days_since_signal_basis` ("sessions"|"calendar") discloses the units of
    # days_since_signal, which the shared stocktable.js NEW-dot filter reads as
    # sessions; the US board now answers in sessions whenever the verdict carries a
    # marker-anchored fresh_bars count and labels the calendar fallback.
    # `ranking.component_coverage` also lands here (inside the existing `ranking`
    # object, so it adds no top-level or item-level key).
    # 1.6.0 -> 1.7.0 (2026-08-04, prophet-us W4): two DISPLAY-TIER per-row keys, both
    # additive and both conditional. `post_earnings_move` ({date, day0, day0_move_pct,
    # basis, ...}) is attached only when the name reported inside the trailing 5
    # sessions. It is deliberately NOT called `earnings_reaction` — that token is the
    # hot-tape lane's TRIGGER name (engine/marketing/hot_tape.py) for a related but
    # different thing, and one token across two artifact vocabularies makes every future
    # grep ambiguous. `earnings_soon` has shipped since MLC-W5 but was never registered; W4
    # documents it and widens it — besides the existing CHIP shape (days_to + chip_en/
    # chip_zh, unchanged) it now also carries a DISCLOSURE shape on a row whose store
