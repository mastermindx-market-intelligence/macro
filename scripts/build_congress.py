"""Build the Congressional / Politician Disclosed Trades desk: render site/congress_trades.html.

Additive + display-only. Reads the Quiver congressional-disclosure history
(``data/quiver/congress.parquet`` — every STOCK-Act filing by a member of the U.S. House or
Senate) and turns it into a COPY-SIGNAL watchlist:

  * MEMBERSHIP — a ticker joins the watchlist the moment a member discloses a trade in it and
    stays ``ROLLOFF_DAYS`` (~half a year) from its MOST-RECENT disclosure before falling off;
    each new disclosure extends the timer.
  * IMPORTANCE — names disclosed by MORE (and bipartisan) members are flagged more important
    (distinct-member count in-window).
  * SCORE — every name is ranked by a composite of four sub-scores:
      1. CLUSTER  — the politician signal: distinct-member breadth, recency-weighted net-buy bias,
                    aggregate disclosed size, freshness, bipartisan bonus.
                    Freshness is now keyed on TransactionDate (the actual trade), NOT ReportDate
                    (the filing). A trade disclosed recently but executed months ago scores
                    correctly: its economic age determines its weight.
      2. TECHNICAL — the engine read from this name's own ``site/stockdata/<T>.json`` (conviction
                    band/size + the daily tech block); hard vetoes (cycle-blocked / parabolic /
                    avoid bucket) floor it low.
      3. BUYABLE-ZONE ("act now?") — is the name's SECTOR (regime ``sector_rs``) and THEME
                    (allocation ``ranks``) leading, and is the trend constructive?
      4. ENTRY-TIMING (W2 of this desk) — operator-ordered 2026-07-18. Display-tier re-rank
                    toward better entries. Sources wash signals (2W/1M washout), MACD cross, and
                    Stochastic cross from engine/congress_entry.py (entry_snapshot). Deliberately
                    VETO-EXEMPT: a washed-out name in a downtrend is exactly when this leg must
                    surface for entry-hunting. Gate tier (T1/T2/T3) contributes here, not as a
                    badge only. Entry leg is 0 when local close is unavailable (uncovered path).
                    Names with front_line=True are sorted to the front of each unconfirmed bucket.

FRESHNESS FIX (W1-S13 T2): _decay now runs on TransactionDate. A filing_lag_days column
(ReportDate − TransactionDate) is computed per trade; lags > 45 d are flagged "late ⚠️"
(STOCK Act limit). Transaction age (days since TransactionDate) is surfaced as a provenance
chip, and a tx-age downweight depresses trades > TX_AGE_STALE_DAYS.

MEMBER RELIABILITY (W1-S13 T1/T3): engine/congress_members.py computes per-member shrunk
hit-rate (empirical-Bayes toward pooled 39.3% baseline). A small member_quality term is
added to the cluster score (weight W_MEMBER_QUALITY). Every surfaced row gets a member-tier
chip ("hit 62% · n=24 · proven").

PROVENANCE HONESTY (W1-S13 T4): ETF tickers are flagged (visible chip, reduced but NOT
removed). Single-member tickers are flagged. Stale tickers (latest tx > 90 d) are flagged.

ENTRY BADGE (W1-S13 T5): tickers with a T1/T2/T3 signal-gate verdict are badged ⚡ with
their tier. The gate store is site/factordata/signal_gate.json.

DOCTRINE (CLAUDE.md / the desk): the politician cluster GENERATES the idea; the engine + zone
lenses CONFIRM it. A name five members bought that is extended / below its 200d / cycle-blocked
stays HIGH-interest but is NOT ``act_now`` — confirmation over prediction.

Returns 0 on ANY error so it can never break the daily build (mirrors build_alt_data.py).
Display / research only — never trades.
