"""scripts/marketing_fastlane_daemon.py — Runner for the marketing fast lanes.

Drives three intraday lanes:
    earnings  the original earnings fast lane (earnings_feed + fastlane.run_tick).
    press     PRESS-FEEDS B1 (D05 Addendum 2) — the Trump/markets wire spine:
              wire RSS (breaking_feed.poll_all) + press providers
              (press_providers.poll_all: trumpstruth mirror, twitterapi.io x_relay,
              CNN backfill) -> relevance -> corroboration -> summarize-with-citation
              -> persist the Intelligence Desk + live rail; optionally emit
              kind="breaking" outbox items with scheduled_at="immediate".
    reply     XG-W6 reply-desk PRODUCER — reply_producer.run_producer:
              twitterapi.io discovery (reply sub-budget, since-id cursors) ->
              deterministic scorer -> per-persona drafter -> the nine critics ->
              reply_queue.enqueue. NOTHING SENDS: output lands in the M0 queue for
              operator review, and only reply_export at M1+ hands anything to the
              desktop lane. This lane runs HERE, on the wire daemon's host, and
              never on the render path.

Usage:
    python scripts/marketing_fastlane_daemon.py [--lane earnings|press|reply|all] \
        [--once] [--dry-run] [--interval N] [--preflight]

Flags:
    --lane L     Which lane(s) to drive (default: earnings, for back-compat).
    --once       Run exactly one tick then exit (useful for cron / one-shot jobs).
    --dry-run    Compute the full tick (fetch, dedupe, score, corroborate, summarize,
                 card) but write NOTHING to disk. Prints a would-emit summary.
    --interval N Poll interval in seconds. Default 120, except --lane reply, which
                 reads reply_desk.producer.tick_interval_s (300 s) so the cadence is
                 a config key rather than a number frozen into a systemd unit.
                 An explicit flag always wins. Ignored with --once.
    --preflight  Reply lane only. Print the readiness readout (the four arming
                 switches, the author register, per-desk modes, the heartbeat) and
                 exit 0/1. Zero network, zero spend, zero writes; runs even when
                 the kill switch is off, because "the kill switch is off" is
                 exactly the answer it most often has to give.

Kill-switches (BOTH gate press emission):
    MARKETING_FASTLANE_ENABLED != "1"  -> the whole daemon prints a note and exits
                                          0 immediately (no work at all).
    MARKETING_PUBLISH_ENABLED not set  -> the press lane still reads, scores, and
                                          advances the live Intelligence Desk, but
                                          emits NOTHING to the social outbox.
                                          --dry-run forces outbound off too.

Reply-lane arming — FOUR independent switches, each of which fails as silence:
    1. the process runs at all:      MARKETING_FASTLANE_ENABLED=1 (shared with
                                     the wire; main() exits 0 without it)
    2. the lane is invoked:          --lane reply|all, i.e. the sibling unit
                                     app/deploy/marketing-reply-desk.service
    3. the producer is armed:        reply_desk.producer.enabled: true
                                     (config/marketing.yml — NOT inherited from
                                     the wire's switch: this lane bills
                                     twitterapi.io on its own sub-budget)
    4. discovery can poll:           TWITTERAPI_IO_KEY in the environment
    Sending is a FURTHER, independent step (the per-account mode dial).
    `--preflight` reports all four in one readout; the runbook §9 is the walk.

Heartbeat:
    Each successful tick touches data/marketing/fastlane_heartbeat.txt with the
    current UTC timestamp.  --dry-run skips the heartbeat write. That file is
    shared by every lane in this process, so it proves the DAEMON is alive and
    nothing more; the reply lane additionally writes its own per-lane artifact
    (<reply desk state>/producer_heartbeat.json) carrying the tick counter, the
    consecutive-empty run and the last tick's stage counts — the difference
    between "dead daemon" and "alive and finding nothing", which need opposite
    responses.

Press-lane local state (gitignored — data/marketing/press/):
    provider cursors / conditional-GET ETags / spend accounting / flagship counter
    / corroboration window / seen-ledger / the B4c zh translation cache.  The poller
    makes ZERO repo/git writes and advances NO forward ledger (the zh pass therefore
    keeps its cache here rather than in the git-tracked news-translation cache, and
    suppresses the lib.ai_costs append that the nightly is the sole advancer of).

No git writes.  No ledger advances.  The daemon is a fully intraday lane.

    ids the PERSISTED window already has a twin for, and they are skipped: an item
    re-arrives on later ticks (a recomposed body, a tape stamp attached late) with
    no `zh` on it, and without this it would be re-sent every tick for as long as
    it stays in the window — the merge would then throw the freshly-bought
    translation away in favour of the persisted one. The text-hash cache usually
    absorbs that, but "usually free" is not a budget, and one cache wipe would turn
    it into a real per-tick bill.

    The trailing " · <tape_stamp>" is stripped before translating: the stamp is a
    language-neutral "LABEL ±X.X%" that the rail re-renders from the structured
