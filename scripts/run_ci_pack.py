"""Run the legacy CI manifest using a small number of shared runners.

GitHub Actions used to provision one fresh VM for every job in ``ci.yml``.
The repository is large enough that checkout and interpreter setup dominated
the useful test work, so one PR fanned out to more than eighty hosted runners.

The workflow now contains one small ``ci-pack`` matrix instead. Legacy job
definitions live in ``.github/ci/legacy-jobs.yml`` so GitHub does not publish
roughly one hundred skipped check runs on every pull request. The pack jobs call
this script, which validates the manifest and executes every legacy ``run``
step. A hard reset/clean between legacy jobs preserves their former
clean-checkout isolation. Jobs with different declared pip dependencies also
get freshly recreated virtual environments; only jobs whose install commands
are byte-identical share an environment.

Which jobs land in which pack is decided ONCE, by ``build_plan``, and published
as a hashed ``CIPackPlan`` (``--plan-only``). Each pack consumes that exact JSON
artifact, validates its hash/tree/head/base and manifest execution contracts,
and never recomputes selection or partition, so twelve runners cannot quietly
disagree about what the suite is.

The validator is intentionally fail-closed.  A future job using services,
containers, per-step conditions/environments, or an unfamiliar action must
teach this runner how to preserve that behavior before the workflow can pass.

Execution is refused outside GitHub Actions because workspace cleanup is
destructive by design.  Local callers can safely use ``--validate-only``.

# Changed-path scoping (2026-08-09)
#
# Every pull request used to run every legacy job regardless of its diff, so
# a one-template PR paid for the entire engine/site/research suite: 4 packs x
# ~30 min x every PR, against an account-wide hosted-runner pool. Measured
# 2026-08-09: 122 runs queued, packs waiting 46-85 MINUTES for a runner.
# Adding runners buys a constant factor; per-PR cost is what scales with fleet
# size, so scoping the suite to the diff is the only lever that changes slope.
#
# The design is fail-SAFE in every direction, because a false green here is far
# more expensive than a wasted runner-minute:
#   * a job with NO `paths:` always runs (declaring a scope is opt-in);
#   * no --changed-from (main's baseline, workflow_dispatch) runs everything;
#   * a git failure runs everything;
#   * touching a GLOBAL_INVALIDATOR runs everything;
#   * a scope that does not cover the paths its own commands name is a hard
#     manifest error, not a silent skip (see _scope_coverage_findings).
#
# The residual risk is an IMPLICIT dependency: a scoped job whose tests import a
# module the commands never name. That cannot be caught statically here, so the
# the full manifest still audits main. Ordinary PRs do not widen to that audit
# merely because one changed path has no proven owner — that mapping was the
# speed hole (PR #5488: `.claude/hooks/gh_quota_guard.py` → all 185/187 jobs).
# Unowned paths stay on always-on fences + owners of the rest of the diff.
# Main / CI_SCOPE_MODE=off remains the long fail-fast:false heal pack.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A change to any of these invalidates scoping entirely: they can alter what any
# job means, so no per-job scope can be trusted against them.

# 2026-08-14: `engine-render-guards` (1036) was split into three lanes. Its 1036
# was a hosted measurement of the whole job, and no hosted per-STEP breakdown
# exists, so the three weights below are that hosted total re-apportioned by the
# per-step shares measured locally in
# research/CI_RENDER_GUARD_TIMING_RECEIPT_2026-08-12.md (427.6s wall, twelve
# steps): rot sweep + statement-tape 83.4%, the express guards 10.8%, the
# B4/attested-history cluster 5.8%. Two express steps (market-score authority,
# China Policy Watch) were wired AFTER that receipt and are unmeasured, so
# express carries an explicit allowance above its 112s share. These are
# estimates from a measured shape, not a second hosted run — replace them from
# a green post-split run's step timings when one exists.
# Which (role, event) pairs may mint or consume a semantic plan.
#
# ``role`` carries the SUBSTANCE and is enforced separately below: ``pr_head``
# requires an exact changed-file inventory and ``changed_from == base_sha``;
# ``main`` requires one identical tree/head/base SHA and no ``changed_from``.
# The event is the TRANSPORT, and it is allowlisted rather than ignored so a
# combination nobody has reasoned about fails closed instead of silently
# planning something unintended.
#
# The two ``main`` triggers below the dispatch were added 2026-08-19 because
# leaving them out did not fail closed in the useful sense — it left the lane
# that runs every ``gate: data`` job unable to run ANY of them. ``data-health.yml``
# (W2 of research/CI_MERGE_GATE_RELIABILITY_ROOT_CAUSE_2026_08_19.md) took the
# 74 data-gated jobs off the merge gate on the promise that this lane would still
# grade them AFTER the nightly writes the tree they assert against. It fires on
# ``workflow_run`` (daily completed) and on a 13:30 UTC ``schedule`` backstop,
# and both resolve role ``main`` — so both raised ManifestError before a single
# legacy job ran. Measured: run 32262001614 (schedule, 2026-08-19T14:06Z) died
# with ``main/schedule is unsupported``, exit 2, in all SIX packs; the
# ``workflow_run`` run 32246816331 only escaped the same fate because its packs
# were skipped by the daily-success condition. The single execution that lane
# achieved all day came from a manual ``workflow_dispatch``, and it graded the
# universe against ``data/symbol_directory/snapshots/2026-08-10.parquet`` — nine
# days stale, because the 2026-08-19 snapshot (6f3fd8b3ea1f) was not committed
# until 12:16Z, after it. The schedule that exists to catch exactly that ordering
# is the one that could not start.
#
# Both events describe the same shape ``main`` already means: a whole-tree run at
# one checked-out SHA with no diff. Nothing about the substance is relaxed here —
# the ``role == "main"`` invariants still reject a plan that is not that shape.
# The set stays CLOSED; ``push`` is deliberately absent (no gating workflow uses
# it, and ci.yml has no push trigger).
#
# ``ci_semantic_proof._identity`` keeps its OWN, narrower pair set on purpose —
# do not "unify" it with this one. That gate also asserts ``workflow == "ci"``:
# it judges merge-gate proofs, and a data-health plan is not one. Widening it
# would let a non-gating lane's plan pose as authority for a merge.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Plan once, execute many (2026-08-11)
#
# Every pack used to re-derive the entire selection for itself: twelve runners
# each loading the manifest, each running infer_job_scopes over 180 jobs, each
# re-deciding the same partition from the same inputs.  That decision is a pure
# function of (manifest, changed set, scope mode, pack count), so it is now
# computed ONCE by `build_plan`, published by `ci-plan` as a hashed artifact,
# and CONSUMED by each pack (`--plan-json`). Packs still load and validate the
# current manifest's semantic contracts, but never re-run inference or decide a
# partition. Twelve runners silently disagreeing about the suite becomes one
# loud plan-identity error instead.
#
# What this does NOT buy at this revision, measured 2026-08-11 against the real
# 180-job manifest: it saved ZERO packs THEN.  Scope inference derived scopes for
# 179/180 jobs, yet every realistic diff still selected enough of them to fill
# all twelve packs because named pytest suites inherited ``tests/**`` and ``*``
# from opaque traversals inside those suites.  That catch-all is now stripped
# (``exclude_peer_test_ownership``); a one-test-file PR must no longer emit
# twelve packs.  The empty-pack machinery is load-bearing for that narrowing.
#
# Historical v1 packs recomputed the plan to check one output hash, so the
# planner added a thirteenth inference pass. Semantic v2 cannot do that: the
# plan now contains the complete expected `(logical_job_id, proof_id)` surface,
# execution digests, and exact tree/head/base provenance. Recomputing selection
# would create a second proof universe. Artifact consumption is therefore a
# correctness requirement; avoiding the repeated inference is incidental.
#
# What plan-once buys at this revision is therefore exactly two things, both
# correctness: runners cannot silently disagree about what the suite IS, and
# `ci-gate` receives one complete expected proof surface even when scoped CI
# legitimately launches only a subset of ci-pack-0..11.
