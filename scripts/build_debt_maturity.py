"""Bounded XBRL debt-maturity ingestion producer (packet B-F09-3).

Ledger rows MO-PAID-059 / MO-DELTA-018 sequence this as "first a NEW bounded
XBRL debt-maturity ingestion producer" -- a self-contained module, separate
from the general capital-structure companyfacts governance system
(collectors/sec_capital_structure_companyfacts.py), which is a receipt/
coverage-shaped store that deliberately exposes no raw Company Facts bytes
(engine/capital_structure/companyfacts_authenticated_read.py is a metadata-
only read facade by design, not a source of parseable XBRL facts).

Responsibilities, and only these:

  1. Resolve a ticker to its canonical SEC CIK using the two resolvers that
     already exist and are already committed (GATE 0 finding B2) --
     data/edgar/ticker_cik_ledger.json first, falling back to the
     issuer_master reference parquet's own cik column.
  2. Read (and, online, refresh) a small per-issuer cache of exactly the six
     debt-maturity XBRL tags this feature needs, in the real SEC XBRL
     companyfacts shape engine/debt_maturity.py already expects:
     ``{"cik": <int>, "facts": {"us-gaap": {<tag>: {"units": {"USD": [...]}}}}}``.
     The cache lives under its own bounded path
     (``data/debt_maturity/cache/CIK<10-digit>.json``) -- this is a NEW
     producer-owned artifact, not an assertion about the shape of the
     existing companyfacts store.

No network call is required for the pure engine or for tests: a missing or
unreadable cache degrades to ``facts=None`` and a distinct "not loaded yet"
caller-facing status (never "no SEC filings available" -- that is a positive
claim this producer must have actually earned), it never raises out of this
module, and it never invents a name/theme-matched identity.

Three distinct null states (META-CEO ruling round 2, packet B-F09-3 B2)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A cache MISS (this producer has never reached this CIK, or its last attempt
was a transient network failure) is not the same claim as a cache HIT that
positively confirms the issuer has no SEC filings at all -- conflating the two
would render "No SEC filings available" for a listing this producer simply
has not gotten to yet, which is a fabricated negative. ``refresh_cache_for_cik``
therefore always WRITES a cache file once it has genuinely completed a fetch
cycle (even when that cycle found nothing), and marks a confirmed-empty result
with ``confirmed_no_filings: true`` so a caller can tell the two apart:

  * no cache file on disk               -> caller renders "not loaded yet"
  * cache file, ``confirmed_no_filings`` -> caller passes ``companyfacts=None``
    to ``extract_maturity_ladder`` -> engine's own ``no_filings`` status
  * cache file, real (possibly empty per-tag) facts -> caller passes the
    facts through -> engine's own ``no_maturity_facts`` / ``reported`` status

``refresh_cache_for_cik`` has two call modes. Standalone (``full_companyfacts``
omitted) fetches the six bounded tags itself from SEC's companyconcept API --
used by backfill/ad-hoc tooling. Wired (``full_companyfacts`` supplied by a
caller that already fetched the filer's full companyfacts document in the SAME
nightly step -- ``collectors/edgar_facts.py``'s per-issuer companyfacts fetch,
which this producer is wired into) reuses that payload instead of six more
network round trips; passing ``full_companyfacts=None`` there means the
caller's own fetch positively confirmed (an HTTP 404 on the full companyfacts
document, not a timeout) that this CIK carries no SEC filings at all.
