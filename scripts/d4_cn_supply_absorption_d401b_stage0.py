"""D4-01b Stage 0 — deep-discount block reversion falsifier (family cn_supply_absorption).

PREREG SOURCE (frozen at dispatch): research/SIGNAL_LAB_FRONTIER_DAY4_FABLE_ADJUDICATION_2026-07-08.md
§"D4-01 reassessment" → "Registered re-entry design (D4-01b, staged)". The family verdict
of PR #1932 was VACATED at family level (estimand contamination + rank-not-path matching +
false E2 data gap); the construct kill (price-only absorption = momentum, unidentifiable)
STANDS. This lane is the registered staged re-entry. Stage 0 asks the cheapest decisive
question: does deep-discount block reversion exist AT ALL net of the [t,t+10] price path?
If dead in both regimes, the family CLOSES for real.

FROZEN DESIGN — GATES REGISTERED BEFORE ANY OUTCOME CONTACT
===========================================================

Events (Stage 0):
  Source: data/china_block_tape mrtj partitions (canonical host store; the lane sets
    CHINA_BLOCK_TAPE_STORE because the store is runner-local/untracked and worktrees do
    not carry it — the original lane's false "data gap" came exactly from this).
  Filter: block-day rows 2013-01-01+ with premium_ratio <= -0.15 (RAW RATIO units; unit
    assertions + F5-01 pass-rate print + variant-count divergence at -0.10/-0.15/-0.20
    are hard-asserted before any event is accepted).
  Coverage: .SH -> .SS normalization into data/china_stocks_raw (close+volume);
    known-ticker load check asserted.

Anchoring (AM-S0-1, merged-lane convention preserved):
  t = first trading session strictly AFTER the block date d.
  path  = close[t+10]/close[t] - 1                       ([t,t+10], 10 sessions)
  entry = t+10+1 = t+11 (registered family entry; forward window does NOT overlap path)
  fwd   = close[t+32]/close[t+11] - 1                    (21 sessions from entry)

Contrast (strictly within signal-date; continuous caliper, not rank bins):
  Control pool per date d: covered price-store tickers with valid (path, vol, size, fwd),
    EXCLUDING any ticker with ANY block-tape row (any premium sign) in calendar window
    [d-45, d+50] (AM-S0-4: lookback = partially-treated supply overhang; lookahead covers
    the measurement window, which ends ~t+32 sessions ≈ 46-48 calendar days — a control
    that becomes treated mid-window is not a control. The lookahead leg is estimand
    definition for the falsifier, not a tradable filter, and is flagged as such).
  Covariates: (path raw-return, ln trailing vol, ln trailing size).
    AM-S0-3: trailing stats are vectorized on 60 TRADING BARS (min 20) through the block
    date d: vol = std of daily log returns; size = median(close x volume) with
    zero-volume bars set NaN (upgrade over the merged price-only size proxy — volume
    exists in the store; registered here, before results; fallback ln median close if a
    ticker lacks volume).
  Calipers (AM-S0-5): a candidate control must lie within 0.5 x per-date cross-sectional
    SD (pool ∪ events, ddof=1) of the event on ALL THREE covariates. Up to 3 nearest
    controls by summed SD-normalized |delta| (deterministic; ties by ticker sort order —
    no random sampling). NO caliper relaxation; zero-candidate events are EXCLUDED and
    the exclusion rate printed. Dates with pool < 100 valid controls are dropped
    (printed). Achieved match quality (mean |Δpath| etc.) is printed — "matched on the
    path" must be verifiable, not asserted.
  Episode dedup (AM-S0-2): an event is kept only if the same ticker had no deep-discount
    row in the prior 31 calendar days (refractory window = the [t,t+10]+entry span);
    clustered prints are one episode, not N events. Dedup count printed.

Series and estimands:
  diff_e = fwd_event - mean(fwd of matched controls);  m_d = mean over events at date d,
  n_d = matched-event count. Two estimands per cell, printed SEPARATELY (never conflated;
  the merged run's undisclosed estimand switch is the named failure mode here):
    EW  (DECISIVE): equal-weighted mean of the per-date series {m_d}.
    NW-w (printed, non-decisive): n_d-weighted mean, t via influence-function series
      psi_d = n_d (m_d - mu_w) / mean(n); newey_west_tstat(psi_d + mu_w) gives the exact
      HAC t for the weighted mean.
  Inference: Newey-West with lag = 31 observations (AM-S0-6: horizon-matched — entry lag
  11 + horizon 21 - 1; the per-date series is near-daily so observation-space lag ≈
  trading-day lag).

Regimes (mandatory split; pooled is NON-decisive per the 减持新规 law):
  Split at 2023-08-27 by BLOCK DATE d: pre = [2013-01-01, 2023-08-26], post = 2023-08-27+.

FROZEN GATE (Stage 0):
  Minimum-N floor per regime cell, pre-registered before looking at returns:
    n_matched_events >= 300 AND n_distinct_signal_dates >= 100. A cell below floor is
    UNPOWERED: it carries NO verdict either way and is labeled as such.
  Cell ALIVE iff: floor met AND mean_EW > 0 AND |t_NW(EW)| >= 2.0 AND BH q <= 0.10,
    with BH computed across the POWERED regime cells' two-sided HAC p-values (alpha .10).
  Stage-0 outcome:
    >= 1 powered cell ALIVE  -> Stage 0 ALIVE -> Stage 1 (flow-intensity DiD) proceeds.
    no powered cell ALIVE    -> FAMILY CLOSES (per the registered design: the base
      reversion is dead/crowded-out in both regimes and the absorption interaction has
      no room). Unpowered cells are reported, not adjudicated.
    both cells unpowered     -> NO VERDICT; lane returns to the bench (not expected:
      pre-regime has ~8.4k deep rows / 1,565 dates, post ~5.4k / 685).
  The EW estimand is decisive by freeze. If EW and NW-w disagree, EW rules and the
  disagreement is REPORTED (that pattern is exactly the event-heavy-cluster signature).
  No other outcome-bearing cells exist in Stage 0; all other prints are descriptive
  context with zero gate weight.

Stage 1 (pre-declared; RUN ONLY IF STAGE 0 ALIVE): flow-intensity DiD per the registered
  design — treatment intensity = amt_wan / event-date free-float recomputed from the
  price store (not the tape's precomputed amt_pct_mktcap); "absorbed" = price holds/
  rises over [t,t+10]; the not-absorbed counterfactual is PRINTED blocks that gave back
  the print (never absence-of-print — endogenous observability); decisive term = the
  within-date interaction (absorbed - gave-back | heavy supply) minus (same path split |
  no supply). E1 holder-sale windows ride only as a labeled non-decisive ITT leg.

Trial accounting: the full Stage-0 cell grid is logged to the TrialLedger (family
  cn_supply_absorption) AT GENERATION, before outcomes are computed. The lane does not
  commit data/trial_ledger.jsonl (intraday data/-discard law); the delta is reported in
  the PR body.

Run:
    CHINA_BLOCK_TAPE_STORE=<canonical>/data/china_block_tape \
        python -m scripts.d4_cn_supply_absorption_d401b_stage0
Writes reports/d4-cn-supply-absorption-d401b-stage0.md (frozen prereg printed BEFORE
results). Display-tier study output; not a production signal; no signal keys are
originated by this lane.

POST-FREEZE ADDENDUM (added AFTER the gated results were seen; zero gate weight)
================================================================================
The freeze above set the HAC lag at 31 OBSERVATIONS on the stated premise that the
matched per-date series is near-daily. The realized series is NOT near-daily (matched
dates cover roughly one in three trading days pre-规), so lag-31-in-observation-space
mis-scales the intended 31-trading-day forward-window overlap. The direction of the
resulting SE error is NOT uniform across cells (Opus review: the corrected lag raises
t only for pre-规 and lowers it for post-规 and pooled), so no directional claim is
made — the sensitivity simply re-reads both estimands per cell at an overlap-matched
lag (median count of subsequent observations within 45 calendar days ≈ 31 CN trading
days) to establish robustness of the outcome to the lag choice. The frozen gate stands
unchanged per prereg discipline. Trials are ledger-logged; the report labels the block
as post-freeze and non-decisive.
