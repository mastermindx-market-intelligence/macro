"""scripts/build_live_quotes.py — lightweight intraday QUOTES-ONLY snapshot.

Writes a single ``quotes.json`` in the SAME contract the Cloudflare Worker
``/quotes`` endpoint serves, so the browser ``live.js`` treats a worker response
and this static snapshot identically:

    { "ts": <ms>, "asof": <iso>, "source": "snapshot",
      "quotes": { "AAPL": {"price":.., "ts":<ms>, "source":"yahoo|polygon",
                           "basis":"regular|trade|..", "prevClose":..,
                           "changePct":..}, ... },
      "meta": {"requested":N, "resolved":M, "polygon_status":".."} }

WHY this exists: a static GitHub-Pages site can't refresh its own prices. A tiny
GitHub Action runs this every few minutes during market hours and force-pushes the
JSON to a single-commit ``live-data`` branch; the page fetches it from
``raw.githubusercontent`` (CORS ``*``, ~5-min CDN cache), keyless. This is the
ZERO-DEPLOY live path that works WITHOUT the Cloudflare Worker. When the Worker IS
deployed it takes precedence (real-time US via Polygon) and this snapshot becomes
the off-worker fallback — both are wired in ``templates/live.js``.

Universe = every ``data-sym`` the built site emits (so whatever the pages render
goes live) UNION a CORE of US + international index symbols and US index futures
UNION every tracked basket member (US + HK membership files — the basket-pulse
builders compute from this snapshot, see basket_member_symbols()).
Quotes-only: NO scipy, no overlay math — installs fast, runs in seconds.

Graceful: any feed down -> the symbol is simply absent and live.js keeps the baked
number. ``--offline`` writes an empty-quotes snapshot (ship-safe / tests).

# (show_change=true, pinned by tests/test_prophet_card_live_change.py) — but
# DISPLAY_SYMBOLS above is a hand-kept list of macro TILE symbols only, so every
# single-name card asked live.js for a symbol this snapshot never fetched:
# `pick()` returned an empty reading, patchChgNode() bailed on `chg == null`, and
# every board's pills held their baked "—" through a live session no matter how
# the tape actually moved. The board's names are re-picked nightly, so this leg
# is SCRAPED from the built pages rather than hard-listed — same contract as the
# full-universe scrape below ("whatever the page renders goes live"), just
# narrowed to the board pages so the once-a-minute same-origin snapshot stays
# small.
#
# EVERY VISIBLE nb-chg BOARD, not just China (2026-08-19). The original
# China-only cut (2026-08-13) was a scoped-decision placeholder, not a permanent
# split: us_stocks.html, hk_stocks.html and canada_stocks.html render the exact
# same live-change pill and were shipping the exact same dead-pill bug (measured
# in production 2026-08-19 against https://www.mastermind-x.com/live/quotes.json,
# 89 symbols: china_stocks.html 54/54 covered, us_stocks.html 0/3, hk_stocks.html
# 0/4, canada_stocks.html 0/10). Measured in THIS checkout (`site/` scan,
# 2026-08-19): every page below is a page this repo actually builds that emits a
# `.nb-chg` tag carrying a `data-sym` — us_stocks.html 4, china_stocks.html 54,
# hk_stocks.html 4, canada_stocks.html 10, crypto.html 27 distinct (30 tags),
# macro.html 10, canada.html 5, china.html 4, commodities.html 4, hk.html 4.
# Full-site scan found no OTHER built page emitting visible nb-chg+data-sym
# markup outside this list (sector_central.html is the one deliberate exemption
# — see DISPLAY_BOARD_EXEMPT_PAGES below). Board leg went 54 -> 128 distinct
# symbols (still under DISPLAY_BOARD_CAP); universe 89 -> 144 (+55). Vendor
# split of the expanded universe: 12 Polygon-routable US names (one chunk, at
# most 100/chunk, so +1 request) + 132 keyless-Yahoo-routable (batch size 20);
# a free keyless probe of all 45 NEW Yahoo-routable symbols resolved 45/45 in
# 2.13s. Per-symbol serialized size is ~183B median, so 144 symbols is ~26KB —
# nowhere near the 500KB browser-fetch budget. The quality gate
# (scripts/vps_live_orchestrator.py min_resolved=50 / min_coverage=0.10) stays
# far above both floors at the observed resolve rate, so this expansion cannot
# starve the gate or freeze the published file, and the China leg is additive

# THE GATED HALF OF A BOARD PAGE (2026-08-20). Scraping `site/<page>.html` finds

# server-renders just `preview_rows` cards into the HTML and writes the withheld
# remainder to `site/premiumdata/<page>.json` as pre-rendered `*_html` blocks, which
# the page fetches post-auth and splices into the very same `.nbgrid`
# (dashboard.html.j2 `hydrate()`). Those cards are rendered from the SAME partial
# with the SAME `.nb-chg` pill — they are not a different, lesser surface — so a
# scrape that stops at the .html covers the preview and abandons the rest.
#

# none of which reached /live/quotes.json's 146 symbols. Every one of those 60 cards
# showed a live price beside a dead "—" percentage, all night, every night — the
# exact defect DISPLAY_BOARD_PAGES was added to fix, reintroduced for the paying
# tier only, because the gate moved the cards but nothing moved the scrape.
#

# headroom is the point — the US board is re-picked nightly and its 63 names are
# now ALL in the leg instead of 3, so a heavier board night that used to cost 1
# slot can cost 60. At 240 that leaves ~50 slots of swing before `out[:cap]`
# starts eating late-alphabet names ALPHABETICALLY (a truncation that reads, on
# the page, as exactly the dead-pill bug this leg exists to fix); 320 restores the
# ~2x margin the 240 cap had over its own 128. Cost at the new ceiling: ~59KB
# serialized (~183B/symbol median, vs the 500KB browser-fetch budget), <=16
# keyless-Yahoo batch requests (20/batch) plus <=4 Polygon chunks (100/chunk),

# 24/7 btc-live Action and the 30-min intraday fastpath). The

    ~1942 symbols (CORE 39 + site data-sym ~1918 + conviction overlap). A
    Yahoo-path timing run resolved 1938/1942 in 53 s wall-clock — well within the
    live-quotes workflow 8-min job timeout (~11 % utilisation). File size at full
    universe was 275 KB (< 500 KB browser-fetch budget). At cap=800 only ~249/680
    basket members survived alphabetical truncation.
    Raised 2200 → 3000 (2026-07-12, HK pulse): the membership leg joins every
    tracked US + HK basket member explicitly (~810 symbols, +147 unique .HK) so
    pulse coverage never depends on which pages happen to emit a data-sym;
    production universe lands ~2130 unique. At the measured ~37 symbols/s Yahoo
    rate that is ~58 s — still ~12 % of the 8-min job timeout — and 3000 leaves
    ~870 symbols of growth headroom. Basket members sit right after CORE so a
    future cap squeeze can never truncate the pulse universe (the ordering IS
    the priority)."""
