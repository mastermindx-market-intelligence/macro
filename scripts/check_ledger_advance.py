"""CSP-W6 — Forward-ledger heartbeat.

Silent ledger freezes become same-night escalations.

On every trading day where the site has republished (detected via the
--render-happened flag passed by the workflow), asserts that each registered
forward ledger's newest asof has advanced compared to the snapshot taken
during the previous run.  When a ledger is stalled while the site republished,
appends a row type_=ledger_stall to the fail-streak ledger via the shared
push_ops_alert machinery (same W6b spine as check_builder_failstreaks.py) and
emits a ::warning:: annotation to the GitHub Actions step summary.

Design principles (house laws):
 - Detection only, never a gate: this script always exits 0 (CSP-R1 forbids
   fail-dark — detection and disclosure, never fail-dark).
 - Sole-advancer: data/ci/ledger_heartbeat_state.json is the SINGLE state file
   for this check; no other script may write it.  It stores the previous-run
   snapshot of each ledger's newest asof, keyed by the ledger path (relative to
   repo root).
 - Idempotent per asof: same-calendar-day re-runs do NOT double-append to the
   fail-streak ledger or double-alert (dedup keyed on today_str per ledger).
 - Trading-day aware: weekends and US market holidays are skipped entirely (no
   stall detection, no state mutation on non-trading days).
 - Fail-open: any read/parse error degrades gracefully; exit 0 always.
 - Render-happened flag: the workflow passes --render-happened when the site
   commit step ran for that date.  Without it, stall detection is suppressed
   (we only escalate when the site republished with stale content).
 - State file location convention: data/ci/ mirrors the fail-streak ledger
   location (data/ci/builder_failstreaks.json).
 - Atomic-ish write: tmp file then os.replace (same idiom as
   check_builder_failstreaks.py).

Ledger manifest (extend this constant; add a comment when adding):
_LEDGER_MANIFEST is the authoritative list.  Each entry is a repo-root-relative
path to a JSONL forward ledger.  The asof field is the first key tried; fallback
tries 'date', then 'logged_at'.  A ledger that does not exist yet (e.g.
leadership_crack/forward_log.jsonl before W6 ships) is silently skipped — a
missing file is never escalated as a stall (it may simply not have been built yet).

Background (#2738 fail-streak pattern, CSP-W6):
The 2026-07-16 collect-cancel-while-always() incident showed that a silent
ledger freeze on a republish night looks identical to a healthy run at a glance.
This script makes that class of freeze same-night visible without gating or
blocking any pipeline step.
