"""scripts/metabolism_gc.py — Orphan-worktree GC helper (A1 companion).

Reaps wf_*/metabolism worktrees whose branch is fully absorbed into
origin/main or whose journal is in a terminal state (done/failed), subject
to safety checks:

  1. rev-parse --show-toplevel guard (dead-worktree-hits-main trap):
     If the worktree's `.git` file resolves to the MAIN repo root rather than
     a worktree root, the worktree is detached/dead. Do NOT operate on it.

  2. lsof guard (live-parked-session trap):
     If any process has an open file descriptor inside the worktree directory,
     a live session is parked there. Skip it.

  3. Branch merged check:
     ``git merge-base --is-ancestor <branch> origin/main`` — merged iff the
     branch tip is reachable from origin/main (tip-equal-to-main counts: a
     commit is its own ancestor).  NOT an empty ``git log <branch>..origin/main``
     — that range is the INVERSE (empty means origin/main is an ancestor of the
     branch, true for a worktree freshly rebased onto the origin/main tip with
     unpushed local commits).  Squash merges rewrite content into a new commit
     and are invisible to ancestry — the journal-terminal check (4) is the path
     that reaps those.

  4. Journal terminal check:
     The worktree's ``data/metabolism/journal/`` contains at least one journal
     file whose top-level status is "done" or "failed".

Only worktrees matching a configured name pattern (default: ``wf_*`` or
``metabolism-*``) are inspected.  All others are untouched.

STATELESS-CATTLE LAW (R-AUT-3): this script reads git state, acts, and exits.
No persistent sessions.  Idempotent: re-running on an already-removed worktree
logs a clean skip.

NEVER-RAISE CONTRACT: all exceptions are caught and logged.  The script always
exits 0 so a GC failure never blocks the loop.

Usage:
    python -m scripts.metabolism_gc [--dry-run] [--root /path/to/repo]

    ancestor; any other exit (e.g. 128 for an unknown ref) is treated as NOT
    merged — fail-safe, never reap on an errored check.

    Direction trap: an empty ``git log <branch>..origin/main`` is NOT this
