"""gex_state_index — the cross-root positioning aggregate (MSC R3.2/R3.3).

Builds ``site/options_structure/gex_state/_index.json``: one compact row per root
from the per-root ``gex_state`` artifacts already in that directory. The Terminal's
screener columns and watchlist regime dot need ONE fetch across the universe;
before this file existed there was no cross-root positioning aggregate anywhere
on R2 (site/gex/index.json is site-only and speaks the board's two-state regime
vocabulary, not gex_state's six-state one).

Transport is free by construction: the file lands in the gex_state directory,
so it rides the nightly's ``git add site/`` and the dedicated launchd R2
projection (``com.mastermind.gexstate-mirror``) as part of the exact bundle.

Honesty rules:
- Rows are built by GLOBBING the directory — the same set of files the mirror
  serves per-root — so the index can never disagree with what a per-root fetch
  returns. Each row carries its OWN asof date; a root that stopped building
  keeps its last state and its stale date travels with it (staleness is data,
  not something to hide by dropping the row).
- ``pin_probability`` and the trigger fields are deliberately NOT distributed:
  pin is uncalibrated (Tier C — masterplan R2.5) and the triggers are desk-only
  reads. The index carries only the glance-tier fields the consumers render.
- Malformed or ``_``-prefixed files are skipped, never fatal.
