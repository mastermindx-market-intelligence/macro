"""Site page writing — every builder that emits site/**/*.html goes through
write_page() so each page carries the data-base fetch shim even when a builder
runs standalone (its documented usage, e.g. `python -m scripts.build_baskets`)
outside the full render pipeline.

The shim (templates/data_base.js) reroutes the heavy per-ticker OHLC +
search-library fetches to R2 when window.DATA_BASE is set; empty -> no-op. It
must load FIRST, before any page code runs a data fetch, so it goes at the TOP
of <head>, non-deferred, with a depth-aware src prefix ("../" per directory
under site/) — but AFTER an early <meta charset>: the ~1.6KB inline body pushed
an immediately-following charset declaration past the HTML5 pre-scan window
(the parser only examines the first 1024 BYTES for it), so any serving path
that omits charset in Content-Type (python -m http.server previews, mirrors,
some CDN variants) fell back to windows-1252 and every CJK string literal in
classic external scripts (nav_market.js, …) decoded as mojibake (更多 →
æ›´å¤š). A charset meta can never run a fetch, so load-first is intact.
Without write-time injection, committing a standalone builder's
output silently strips the tag and regresses the R2 rerouting (nearly shipped
in #1045). scripts/inject_data_base.py — the CI post-render step — imports
inject_text() from here and remains the idempotent safety net for any page
that slips past this path.

# --- rendered ticker universe (cross-page dead-link filter) ------------------
# WHICH stocks/<TICKER>.html pages exist is decided nightly by DATA, not by a
# template: build_ticker_pages walks membership.parquet and then drops any
# ticker with no stockdata blob, a `limited` profile, or fewer than three
# substantive sections. 2,842 tickers are membership-active; 1,666 get a page.
#
# Every other surface that links a symbol draws from a WIDER source — peer cards
# from factordata/factors.json, the movers board from the heatmap, the crypto
# rails shelf from baskets/membership.json — so each can name a symbol that
# never got a page. scripts/check_site_asset_refs.py measured 47 such targets
# carrying 211 dead links the first time anyone looked: 197 peer cards over 35
# symbols, 12 movers rows/chips, 2 crypto tiles.
#
# The predicate here is deliberately "a page SHIPS for this ticker", not "this
# ticker passes the render gate". It is what the reader experiences and what the
# guard checks; it needs no cross-builder copy of a four-stage gate that keeps
# moving; and it stays correct the next time that gate changes.
#
# Callers snapshot this ONCE per run and pass the set down. build_ticker_pages
# must snapshot BEFORE its own loop starts writing, so the answer cannot depend
# on how far through the alphabet the loop has got. Nothing ever prunes
# site/stocks/, so the pre-run set is a SUBSET of what ships afterwards: a
# ticker whose page is brand new tonight goes unlinked for one night rather than
# being linked to a 404, and picks up its links on the next render.

# --- head preload hints for late-discovered CSS ------------------------------
# Every stylesheet on these pages is render-blocking, so first paint waits for the
# LAST one to arrive — which makes *when the browser learns the URL* as costly as
# the download. Two structural delays put that discovery late:
#
#   1. externalize_css lifts inline <style> in place, so macro.html's 6 biggest
#      sheets (265KB) sit at byte ~48,000 and one at ~109,000 of a 582KB document.
#      The preload scanner only sees bytes that have ARRIVED, so on a cold mobile
#      connection (TCP slow-start) their fetch waits several extra round-trips
#      that the head's own sheets did not.
#   2. theme.css opens with `@import url(product-nav-icons.css)`. An @import is
#      invisible until its parent has downloaded AND begun parsing, so that 33KB
#      sheet is strictly serialized behind 108KB of theme.css — a guaranteed extra
#      round-trip (~460ms at the measured origin TTFB) in front of first paint.
#
# Both are fixed by hoisting DISCOVERY only: emit `<link rel=preload as=style>` in
# <head> for each late URL. The real <link rel=stylesheet>/@import stays exactly
# where it is, so rule order — and therefore the cascade — is untouched; the sheet
# is simply already in the preload cache when the parser reaches it. Same URL +
# same-origin, so the preload and the real reference share a cache entry and the
# byte fetch happens once.
#
# Runs LAST (inside scripts/optimize_assets.py, after ?v= stamping) because a
# preload href that differs from the stylesheet href by so much as a query string
# is a different cache key — it would double-fetch instead of dedupe.

# --- inline-JS externalization (OPT-IN, unlike CSS) --------------------------
# A page's inline <script> is not the same kind of thing as its inline <style>.
# Almost every one on this site mixes render-time DATA with code (the data-base
# shim, the theme boot script, every builder that bakes a payload into a
# `window.X = {...}` assignment), and a content-hashed static file is the one
# place that data must never land: the hash freezes tonight's numbers behind an
# `immutable, max-age=1y` URL, so returning visitors keep replaying a stale
# nightly bake. So this transform lifts NOTHING by default — a block opts in by
# carrying `data-externalize`, which is the author's assertion that the block is
# static code and that every render-time value it needs arrives from a separate,
# still-inline data script.

    returns the ``src`` — or ``None`` to leave that block inline (below a size
    threshold, or one we choose not to touch). ``index`` is the block's 1-based
    position among the page's marked CANDIDATES (marked, and not already
    carrying ``src``). The JS crosses over byte-for-byte, so behavior is
    unchanged.

    OPT-IN is the whole design, and it is the one place this differs from
    ``externalize_css_text``. Inline scripts on this site routinely embed
    render-time data (``window.OEW_TICKER_MANIFEST = […]``, the theme boot
    script's localStorage read, the data-base shim), and a blind lift would
    freeze a nightly bake into a content-hashed file the edge serves
    ``immutable, max-age=1y`` — a returning visitor would replay last week's
    numbers until some unrelated edit re-minted the hash. Marking a block
    asserts it is STATIC: any render-time value must reach it through a separate
    inline data script, or it will freeze.

    A marked tag that already has ``src`` is left alone (nothing to lift), and
    blocks inside inline ``<svg>`` are NEVER lifted (see ``_svg_spans``) — a
    ``<script src>`` there is foreign content, not an HTML script.

    Idempotent: the replacement carries no marker, so a page already swept has
    no marked blocks left and comes back untouched; a block left inline keeps
    its marker and is re-offered next run.

    ``defer`` and the ``?v=`` stamp are NOT this function's business — the
    emitted tag is deliberately bare and ``optimize_assets_text`` (which runs
    downstream in every lane) adds both.
