"""ONE coverage object for the options family (OIP R8).

THE PROBLEM.  Four builders in this family each answer "how much of the universe did we
actually see?" in a different, non-comparable shape:

  build_options_command   covered / universe / coverage_pct / quality_en / quality_zh
  build_gex_board         {group: {covered, total}} + a "__all__" roll-up
  build_options_screener  n_names / n_young / n_mature / n_skew / n_ivspread / n_relvol
  build_flow_desk         a STRING — "353 names · EOD · direction approx"

So no surface can put two of them side by side, no audit can compare them, and the
flow desk's number cannot be read by a machine at all.  R8 defines the shape once.

CONTRACT
  * ADDITIVE ONLY.  Emitted under the key ``coverage_v1`` ALONGSIDE every existing
    field.  Nothing is removed or renamed — the four builders' current keys are load-
    bearing for pages that ship today, and no surface consumes this object yet.
    Surfaces adopt it in later OIP waves.
  * DISPLAY-TIER.  A coverage count never ranks, sizes, or gates anything.
  * PLAIN WORDS, BILINGUAL.  Every name is an EN/ZH pair of ordinary words — no store
    paths, no slugs, no enums, no "n=".  ``key`` is machine-only and must never be
    rendered; surfaces render ``name_en`` / ``name_zh``.
  * HONEST NULLS.  An uncountable universe is ``n: None``, never 0, and
    ``coverage_pct`` is None rather than a fabricated 100%.  ``sessions_behind`` is
    computed from the exchange calendar (``lib.nyse_calendar``), never wall-clock days,
    so a Monday morning does not report every store as a session staler than it is.
