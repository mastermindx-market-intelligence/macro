"""HKEX session calendar — which HK equity sessions exist, computed from the rules.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-07-08 stale-data incident): when `data/hk_breadth/_closes_cache.parquet`
is committed stale (the `-X theirs` rebase allowed a stale local cache to win), the HK page
served data frozen at 2026-07-02 while appearing fresh. This module is the independent reference
that can detect that staleness: pure rule arithmetic, zero data dependencies, stdlib only.

Scope: full-day closures for HKEX (Hong Kong Stock Exchange). HKEX is closed on HK public
holidays and weekends. The session day is defined as 09:30 – 16:00 HKT; `expected_last_session`
conservatively uses a 17:30 HKT settle buffer.

Unscheduled one-off closures (Typhoon Signal No.8, Black Rainstorm Warning, ad-hoc government
declarations) cannot be computed from rules — they live in `ONE_OFF_CLOSURES` and MUST be
appended when announced. The cost of a missing entry is a false "stale" — a banner on the
page until the date is added — never a silently-wrong "fresh".

HOW TO ADD A ONE-OFF CLOSURE:
    Add the date to ONE_OFF_CLOSURES as `date(YYYY, MM, DD)`.
    Example for a Typhoon No.8 on 2026-09-15:
        date(2026, 9, 15),   # Typhoon No.8 closure
    Commit the change so all environments see the update.
