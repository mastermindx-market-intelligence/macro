"""K3-D Economic Propagation — hypothesis-record validator + deterministic composer.

This module is a pure in-memory VIEW/JOIN executor over the two frozen
contract files:

    contracts/economic_propagation/propagation_hypothesis.v1.schema.json
    contracts/economic_propagation/generator_registry.v1.json

It is never a store: nothing here writes to disk, creates a directory, or
persists any output. ``compose_hypothesis`` builds a record purely in memory
and returns it; the caller decides what (if anything) to do with the result.
It is never a graph: it reads owner evidence references and composes ONE
governed hypothesis/abstention record; it originates no edge, no score, no
rank, no grade, and no authority.

Three-graph law (D0, binding): Graph 1 = economic relationship (why transfer
could occur), Graph 2 = fundamental/narrative similarity (what is comparable),
Graph 3 = residual market (how the market treats the names now). Graph 2/3
evidence can NEVER launder a missing Graph-1 relationship, and a correct typed
abstention is a successful product behavior — this module must refuse where a
naive system would overclaim causality.

Binding kills, carried const in every record (``binding_kills``):
DNR:KILL-PSS-SR2-PEER-DIFFUSION, DNR:KILL-PSS-SR3-PARTICIPATION (the
participation target-generator construction is KILLED — any future peer-state
species needs an ORTHOGONAL source; peer participation/breadth alone never
admits a target here), DNR:KILL-CN-SUPPLY-ABSORPTION, DNR:KILL-CAUSAL-DAG-ALPHA.

Public surface:

    load_hypothesis_schema() / load_generator_registry()
        Repository-canonical contract loaders. No caller-supplied path
        override — callers always validate against the frozen files this
        repo ships (K1 no-vocabulary-injection law).

    validate_hypothesis(record) -> list[Finding]
        Structural (jsonschema draft 2020-12) + semantic (K3D_R0xx)
        validation. Fail-closed: unknown anything is a Finding, never a
        silent pass. Never raises on record defects.

    compose_hypothesis(...) -> dict
        Deterministic in-memory composition. Same input -> byte-identical
        output (record_id + content_sha256 included). Derives graph states,
        hypothesis state, mechanism gating and typed abstention from the
        legs; caller-authored summary/confidence/score of any kind is
        refused with EconomicPropagationError.

    aliases Data OS resolved to the same issuer/security are therefore ONE

    Anything Data OS did not resolve fails CLOSED into a separate namespace.

    alias is canonical. Inside that explicitly non-canonical namespace the
    request text is the only thing that distinguishes one abstention from
    another, so it discriminates (two different unresolved counterparties on one
    event stay two records) while asserting nothing about identity. The
    resolution state is included so two different fail-closed verdicts about the
    same alias are never silently merged.

    A target claiming RESOLVED without the full canonical grain also fails
    closed here. The underlying defect is reported separately: K3D_R013/K3D_R014
    for a null or empty issuer_id/security_id, but a NON-STRING value (which
