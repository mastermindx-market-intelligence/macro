"""lib/chat_allowance.py — the ONE place a chat allowance becomes customer-facing copy.

MNZ-R13 (`research/MASTERMIND_COMMERCIAL_ARCHITECTURE.md` §7): **every customer-facing
quantitative claim about an entitlement must be derived from the config that enforces
it.** Prices have obeyed that rule since W4 — `scripts/build_site._plans_view_model`
reads `config/plans.yml` and the savings badges recompute themselves. Chat allowances
did not: `templates/plans.html.j2` hand-typed "5 quick questions a week", "300 a
month", "unlimited", "150 a month" and four more matrix cells, while
`config/brain.yml` is what `engine.neuralweb.brain_gateway._get_allowance` actually
enforces.

The literals happen to be CORRECT today (verified 2026-08-12 — including "Unlimited",
which is the honest rendering of `quotas.pro.fast.limit: -1`, the uncapped sentinel set
by operator ruling 2026-07-28). That is exactly why this is worth closing now rather
than after an incident: nothing binds them. Reprice the Pro fast lane to 2000 tomorrow
and the pricing page keeps promising "unlimited", silently, with no test to catch it —
the same shape as the drift the price-derivation rule was written to prevent.

A pricing page that promises more than the serving spine will grant is the same class
of defect as a signal we cannot defend — it is just aimed at the wallet instead of the
portfolio. This module makes the promise and the enforcement read the same file.

WHY ``lib/``
------------
Both plans builders need it (`scripts/build_site.py` and `scripts/build_public_pages.py`,
which render the SAME template from two entry points), and `lib/` is the layer they
already share — the same reasoning that put `lib/tiers.py` there.

LANE NAMING
-----------
`config/brain.yml` names the lanes ``fast`` and ``pro``. The customer-facing name for
the ``pro`` lane is "Deep Opus chat", and the word "pro" already means a TIER on every
commercial surface, so this module re-keys it to ``deep``. That rename is contained
here: nothing downstream has to know the config's lane vocabulary.

FAIL LOUD, NOT SILENT
---------------------
A missing or malformed quota block raises, exactly as `_plans_view_model` raises on a
missing `config/plans.yml`. This runs at BUILD time over committed config, never in a
request path — a silent fallback here would re-introduce the very drift the module
exists to close, and would do it invisibly.

#: Tiers that appear on a pricing surface, in ladder order. ``trial`` is a STATUS in
#: `brain_gateway` (status='trialing' selects it regardless of tier name), not a
#: purchasable product, so it is deliberately absent — a plans page that advertised a
#: "trial tier" would be describing something the catalog does not sell.
DISPLAY_TIERS = ("free", "essential", "pro")

#: `unlimited` is a real entitlement string (operator comps — `app/paywall.py`, `/api/me`)
#: but it is not a PRODUCT: it is never sold, never priced, and never appears on a plans
#: surface, so it is correctly absent above. It has no `quotas` block either; the chat path
#: bypasses metering for it in `_check_and_increment_quota` before any ledger I/O rather
#: than reading an allowance.

#: config lane key -> customer-facing lane key (see LANE NAMING above).
_LANE_KEYS = {"fast": "fast", "pro": "deep"}

#: Periods a customer surface knows how to render. `trial` is real in `config/brain.yml`
#: (the `trial` bucket uses it) and is deliberately NOT here — a plans page cannot say
#: "25 a trial". `day` IS here because `_get_allowance` returns it for the FREE fast lane
#: whenever guest access is enabled. An unknown period used to pass straight through and
#: render as an EMPTY word in both languages: `period: trial` shipped
#: `<span class="l-en">5 quick questions </span>` — a published pricing string with a
#: missing noun and no error anywhere. Validate rather than default: defaulting would put
#: a WRONG period on the page, which is worse than refusing to build it.

def chat_allowance_view_model(root: Path | None = None) -> dict[str, dict[str, dict]]:
    """Return ``{tier: {lane: {"limit", "period", "uncapped", "none"}}}`` per display tier.

    ``lane`` is ``fast`` | ``deep``; ``period`` is whatever `config/brain.yml` carries
    (``week`` | ``month``), passed through unchanged so the template renders the same
    word the quota resets on.

    Two boolean flags carry the sentinels so no template ever has to know what a
    negative number means — and so the two ends of the ladder cannot be confused:

    * ``uncapped`` — ``limit < 0``. `brain_gateway._get_allowance` documents this as
      "uncapped requests for that lane"; `config/brain.yml` sets it on
      ``quotas.pro.fast`` per the operator ruling of 2026-07-28 ("Pro Flash is
      Unlimited"). Renders as "Unlimited". The `token_ceilings` fair-use backstop
      still applies and is deliberately NOT advertised — it is a fair-use limit, not
      an allowance.
    * ``none`` — ``limit == 0``: the lane is not included at this tier at all
      (``quotas.free.pro``). Renders as ✗, never as "0 a month".

    Raises ``ValueError`` when a display tier or a lane is missing from the config, so
    a quota block that is deleted or renamed reds CI instead of silently rendering a
    stale literal.
