"""NYSE session calendar — which US equity sessions exist, computed from the rules.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-07-07 stale-regime incident): when the nightly collection push
dies, EVERY committed price store freezes on the same stale date, so any store-vs-store
freshness check (e.g. yahoo/SPY vs the massive manifest in
scripts/refresh_regime_if_stale.py mode 3) sees agreement and stays silent. Only the
exchange calendar knows a completed session is missing from the store. This module is
that independent reference: pure rule arithmetic, zero data dependencies, stdlib only.

Scope: full-day closures for US cash equities (NYSE/Nasdaq share the schedule). Early
closes (13:00 ET) are NOT modeled — a session with an early close still produces a daily
bar, and `expected_last_session` only asks "should a bar for day D exist by now?", for
which the regular 16:00 ET close plus a settle buffer is a conservative answer.

Unscheduled one-off closures (presidential mourning, disasters) cannot be computed:
they live in `ONE_OFF_CLOSURES` and MUST be appended when announced. The cost of a
missing entry is a false "store stale" — a red-but-non-fatal gate step and an honest
`stale` stamp until the date is added — never a silently-wrong "fresh".

    The UTC-midnight rollover defect is already fixed by keying off the ET calendar date.

    This is the correct date to stamp in artifact `as_of` fields and state-dedup keys.
    Using date.today() (UTC) or datetime.utcnow() breaks after ~00:00 UTC when ET is

    Several EOD options stores accrue a row on non-session days: as of 2026-07-29
    ``data/cboe/gex.parquet`` carried 13 non-session rows of 39,
    ``data/cboe/putcall.parquet`` 13 of 39, ``data/options_skew/snapshots.parquet``
    8 of 28, ``data/options_ivspread/snapshots.parquet`` 6 of 21, and the
    ``data/polygon_gex/summary_*.parquet`` family ~11 of 39 dates.  A weekend row is
    NOT a harmless carry-forward duplicate: the builder recomputes IV, spot, walls and
    net-GEX off a stale carried-forward price, so the row is a fabricated observation.
    Left in, it corrupts three things at once — ``.iloc[-1]`` (the "latest" reading can
    be a Saturday), percentile/quantile windows (fabricated points in the distribution),
    and POSITIONAL lookbacks (``.iloc[-6]`` stops meaning "5 sessions ago") including
    any ``n_obs`` count used as an activation gate.

    Two frame shapes are supported:
      * ``date_col=None`` — the frame is indexed by date/DatetimeIndex.
      * ``date_col="date"`` — the dates live in that column (str or datetime).

    PER-ROW REALITY (the docstring used to overpromise here).  A value that cannot be
    read as a date is kept when ``keep_unparseable`` (the default), and that now
    genuinely includes null/NaT: ``pd.Timestamp(None)`` returns ``NaT`` rather than
    raising, and ``is_session(NaT)`` is False, so nulls used to be silently DROPPED by
    the very branch documented as keeping them.  Nulls are detected explicitly.

    NOT-A-DATED-FRAME is a WARNING, not a silent pass.  A missing ``date_col`` or a
    non-datetime index (a ``RangeIndex`` from a ``reset_index()`` or a hand-built test
    frame) makes this function a no-op, which is the worst outcome for a guard: the call
    reads as protection and does nothing.  Both cases log at WARNING and return the frame
    unchanged — the caller is doing something the guard cannot honour.

    FAIL-OPEN otherwise: if filtering would empty the frame the original is returned.  A
    calendar-arithmetic surprise must degrade to the old behaviour, never to a blank
    panel.  ``label`` names the store in the log lines (drops log at DEBUG — a drop is the
    normal case and this runs per-ticker inside the stamp pass, so INFO would flood).

    Returns the filtered frame (a view/copy per pandas' own semantics).

# GAP DISCIPLINE — resolving an "N-session" endpoint by CALENDAR, not by position
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# `session_rows` / `session_dates` above remove rows that should never have existed
# (the #3721 weekend class).  The helpers below address the OPPOSITE failure: rows
# that should exist and DO NOT.  A store that took a collection outage is session-
# GAPPED, so `iloc[-(n+1)]` stops meaning "n sessions ago" — it reads FURTHER back
# and publishes the result under the original day-count label.
#
# Measured on `data/polygon_gex/summary_*.parquet` over 2026-06-15..08-06 (37 NYSE
# sessions, 418 stores): six sessions hold zero rows in ANY store (07-06, 07-15,
# 07-17, 08-03, 08-04, 08-05) and the 08-03..08-05 outage is unrecoverable — the
# snapshot API is current-only.  Across every as_of, the positional endpoint is the
# WRONG session for 54.0% of (as_of, name) pairs.  On a DENSE store positional and
# calendar agree, which is exactly why this hides in testing.
#
# CHOOSE THE REPAIR BY THE STAT'S SHAPE.  Picking one rule for all three is the
# documented mistake:
#
#   TWO-ENDPOINT difference (`x[t] - x[t-n]`) — only the endpoints matter, so an
#     INTERIOR gap is harmless and the stat recovers exactly.  Resolve the far
#     endpoint with `row_n_sessions_back`; return None when that session has no row.
#     Exact, or absent.  Never a wider basis under a narrower label.
#
#   FIT (slope/regression/rolling window over N points) — every point carries
#     information, so refusing on any gap throws away most of the sample: measured
#     at 46% of as_of coverage on the ledger's 5-session basis.  Do NOT refuse.
#     Re-weight against SESSION ORDINALS (`session_ordinals`) so the x-axis is real
#     elapsed session time, and bound how far the window may stretch with a span cap
#     (`sessions_apart`).
#
#   COMPARE (two snapshots where the older one is pinned to "yesterday") — there is
#     no honest widening of "yesterday".  Refuse: `is_prior_session` must hold, or
#     the comparison is null.
#
# FAIL-CLOSED, deliberately inverting this module's other convention.  `session_rows`
# and `session_dates` fail OPEN because dropping every row would blank a panel and a
# calendar surprise should degrade to the old behaviour.  These resolvers fail CLOSED
# (return None / False) because their entire purpose is to refuse a mislabeled number:
# a fail-open resolver would hand back the positional answer it exists to prevent.
