"""A-share (SSE/SZSE) session calendar — which mainland equity sessions exist, from the rules.

WHY THIS EXISTS: china.html had no engine-driven delayed-board disclosure because there was
no CN exchange calendar to measure "sessions behind" against — templates/china.html.j2 said so
in as many words ("There is no CN exchange calendar in lib/, so this claims NO session-count
verdict"), and scripts/freshness_sentinel.py therefore ran the china surface bake-only. The
2026-08-06 outage froze the US board for six days while the page re-baked every night; the
same failure on the China board had nothing watching it. This module is the independent
reference that makes the China board's own lag computable: pure rule arithmetic, zero data
dependencies, stdlib only. Mirrors lib/hk_calendar.py and lib/nyse_calendar.py.

Scope: full-day closures for the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, which share one holiday
schedule. The session day is 09:30-15:00 CST; ``expected_last_session`` uses a 17:00 CST
settle buffer.

DIRECTION OF ERROR — the rule this table is built on
    Marking a real holiday as a session  → we over-count sessions behind → a false "stale"
        banner. Non-fatal, self-clearing, and the sentinel's 12-day china budget absorbs it.
    Marking a real session as a holiday  → we under-count → a silently-wrong "fresh".
        This is the dangerous direction and the reason this table is deliberately MINIMAL.

So the holiday spans below encode only days that are closed EVERY year. Mainland closures are
set annually by the State Council and routinely run longer than the statutory core (Spring
Festival is commonly 8-9 calendar days; Labour Day and Qingming are commonly 3-5). Those extra
days are intentionally NOT encoded — they land in the false-stale direction by construction.
The State Council also designates makeup workdays that turn a Saturday into a real session;
those are not encoded either, and a missed one costs at most one session of under-count, which
cannot by itself flip a >= 2-session verdict.

Because the table is deliberately incomplete, callers must not treat it as the only guard:
scripts/build_china_library.compute_board_staleness pairs it with a calendar-day backstop
(MAX_LEGIT_CLOSURE_DAYS) so a genuine long freeze is disclosed even if every rule here is wrong.

HOW TO ADD A ONE-OFF CLOSURE:
    Add the date to ONE_OFF_CLOSURES as `date(YYYY, MM, DD)`.
    Commit the change so all environments see the update.
