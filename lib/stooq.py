"""Stooq free daily-close fallback for US names the primary feed (Yahoo) refuses.

Yahoo 404s specific *live* large-caps whose vendor symbol has drifted from the one
this repo stores them under — observed Marsh & McLennan and Fiserv — so they never
reach data/yahoo and silently drop out of the searchable stock library. Stooq's free
daily CSV covers US listings and fills those gaps.

Those two names are now handled at the source by lib/ticker_aliases (fetch under the
vendor symbol, store under the config ticker), which is the deterministic fix; this
stays as the generic net for the NEXT such drift. Note the two are opposite cases and
neither is a "garbled" symbol: Fiserv renamed FISV->FI in 2023 and Yahoo still serves
the OLD symbol, while Marsh McLennan renamed MMC->MRSH on 2026-01-14 (a real NYSE
symbol change) and Yahoo serves the NEW one.

IP-GATED: Stooq HTML-blocks some IPs (it returns the site page instead of the
CSV); then this returns None and the caller keeps whatever it had. It is reachable
from CI, which is where the nightly build runs. Returns a tz-naive
DataFrame[close, volume] to match the yahoo store schema. Best-effort, never raises.
