"""app/tape.py — the Live Tape relay (Phase 1).

One process-wide background task connects to Yahoo's unofficial streamer
websocket (wss://streamer.finance.yahoo.com), subscribes the six tape symbols,
decodes each frame with the pure vendored decoder (app/tape_decode.py), keeps a
last-quote cache, and fans every update out to all connected browsers over a
same-origin ``GET /ws/tape``. No browser ever talks to the unofficial upstream
directly (China-reachable + no CORS + one shared upstream connection); no API
keys are involved anywhere in this lane.

Fallback ladder (masterplan §0.2 / honesty rails §6):
  1. upstream trade tick  -> basis "quote"  (honest last price from the feed)
  2. a subscribed symbol silent >~60s during expected trading hours -> REST
     poll of that symbol via engine.live_quotes every <=15s -> basis "poll"
     (honestly downgraded)
  3. the socket being down entirely -> the browser's existing live.js polling
     (worker/snapshot) covers the page; and if THAT is down, the baked numbers
     stand. Each tier keeps its own freshness stamping.

Broadcast payload (JSON, one per symbol update, plus a full snapshot on connect):
    {"sym": "ES=F", "price": 5432.25, "chgPct": 0.85,
     "ts": 1753380000000, "basis": "quote"}
  - ts is epoch MILLISECONDS (matches Date.now() on the client so freshness math
    is trivial).
  - basis is one of "quote" (live upstream tick), "poll" (REST fallback), never
    a fabricated "live".

The whole module is import-safe with no network side effects: nothing connects
until start_tape_hub() is called from the app startup hook, and it degrades to a
no-op (the endpoint just serves the empty cache) if the websockets client lib is
absent.
