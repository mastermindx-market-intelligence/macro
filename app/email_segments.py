"""app/email_segments.py — the ONE definition of who is in an email segment (SEE W4).

Two planes need the same answer to "who is in segment X", and they speak different
languages:

  * ``admin/email_center.py`` runs Supabase **Management-API SQL** (the operator PAT) to
    build the roster, the per-segment counts and the CSV export;
  * ``app/marketing_emails.py`` runs inside macro-api with a **service-role** key and no
    PAT, so it assembles the same roster from the GoTrue admin list + PostgREST and
    filters it in Python.

Two hand-written copies of one predicate is how a compliance gate rots: the export would
say 412 people and the send would reach 419, and nobody would notice until seven of the
extra were the seven who had unsubscribed. So every segment is declared ONCE here as a
PAIR — a SQL ``WHERE`` fragment and a Python predicate over the same normalised row — and
``tests/test_email_segments.py`` asserts the pair agrees on a full grid of rows.

G3/G4 — ``marketing_eligible`` excludes by CONSTRUCTION
-------------------------------------------------------
Its membership rule is not "list everyone, then remember to filter the suppressed out".
The exclusion *is* the rule, in both renderings: an address carried by
``email_suppression``, or a user whose ``email_prefs.marketing_opt_out`` is true, is never
a member of the set, so no caller can forget to apply it and no new caller can
accidentally opt out of applying it.

That is the plan. The DECISION still happens at send time: ``mailer.send(cls='marketing')``
re-reads suppression and the opt-out for every single recipient and is fail-closed on the
lookup itself. A segment computed at 09:00 and drained at 09:40 cannot mail someone who
unsubscribed at 09:20, because the segment never gets the last word.

The base
--------
:data:`BASE_SQL` / :func:`base_match` gate EVERY segment, including ``all``: an account
that is soft-deleted, banned, anonymous, or has no address on file is not a person we can
or may mail. This mirrors ``admin/users.py::_ACTIVE`` (the Users page's own definition of
a real account) and adds the mailability clause; ``tests/test_email_segments.py`` asserts
the mirror still holds, so a change to one is not silently a divergence from the other.

The SQL fragments are static text — no value from an operator, a query string or a
database row is ever interpolated into them. A caller resolves a segment by KEY, and an
unknown key raises rather than reaching SQL (:func:`get`).
