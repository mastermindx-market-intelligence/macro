"""Shared public regular-session quote projector.

Why this exists
----------------
``app/dossier_quote.py`` (the static per-ticker dossier) and
``app/intelligence_hub_market_pulse.py`` (the Intelligence Hub batch route)
both republish ONE thing: a debranded, honesty-checked regular-session quote
tuple built from a raw Terminal Quote Hub row. Before this module that logic
lived only in the dossier, duplicated by hand would have been how the batch
route's honesty law drifted from the dossier's the first time either changed.
This module is the ONE owner of that projection; both callers wrap it with
their own HTTP/schema/rate-limit concerns.

Authority boundary
-------------------
Market-data authority stays with the Terminal Quote Plane. This module owns
no quote store, scheduler, socket or vendor credential — it is a pure
function over an already-fetched row.

Honesty law (the whole point — carried over verbatim from the dossier)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
``freshness`` describes the FEED; ``session`` describes the MARKET. A caller
may only claim "live" when both agree — a measured realtime row *and* an open
regular session. Every uncertainty resolves DOWNWARD:

* a delayed basis is never "live", however recently it was fetched;
* a realtime basis whose own clock has aged past the bound is "stale";
* a missing or unparseable clock is "stale", never assumed fresh;
* an upstream row this module cannot trust raises rather than guessing.

``chg`` upstream is always a PERCENT, never dollars, however plausible a
dollar reading would look; the absolute move is always DERIVED from
price/prevClose, never read as-is from an upstream field of a similar name.
Extended-hours fields (``extPrice``/``extChg``/...) are never read here at
all — regular and extended moves can have opposite signs, and reading either
would let the wrong session's number reach the page.

Debrand law (research/licenses/MASSIVE_ENTITLEMENT_RECORD.md): the vendor is
never named on a public surface. This module never reads or forwards
``source``/``basis``/``anchor_source``/transport fields into its output — the
returned tuple is display-only allowlisted data.

Freshness bounds are deliberately CALLER-CONFIGURABLE. A single dossier page
a reader stares at wants a tight live bound (``app/dossier_quote.py`` keeps
its own, tighter, historical values); a page carrying up to 58 names at once
cannot demand the same per-name cadence without flickering on a healthy but
quiet ticker, so the module defaults to the looser, upstream-consistent
bounds and callers override only when they have a documented reason not to.
