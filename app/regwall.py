"""app/regwall.py — the registration wall (operator lockdown order, 2026-07-24).

Every macro-dashboard product path EXCEPT the deliberately small public funnel
and reviewed SEO estate now requires a signed-in account of AT LEAST the free
tier. That includes HTML, generated JSON, data-bearing JavaScript, images, and
other static artifacts.
Caddy consults this endpoint before serving any protected file:

    204  → registered visitor (valid Supabase session cookie) — serve the file.
    302  → no/invalid session on a document navigation — Location:
           /?signin=1&ret=<original path>.
    401  → no/invalid session on an asset/data request — a small JSON lock
           response, never a redirect that fetch() could mistake for data.

FAIL-CLOSED (the exact inverse of app/gate.py, per the MNZ-R1 doctrine): any
exception in this module denies (302 to the landing). The Caddy side mirrors
it — the gated matcher's error branch redirects instead of serving the file
(see app/deploy/Caddyfile). The one-page-still-up guarantee (CSP-R1) is
carried by the landing, which is never gated.

Session verification reuses app/main.py's secretless machinery:
_mm_supabase_access_token (chunked-cookie parse) + _mm_verify_uid_cached
(GET /auth/v1/user, 10-min positive/negative cache, never raises). The
resulting staleness bound: a signed-out-elsewhere session can pass for up to
one cache TTL (10 min) — acceptable for a REGISTRATION wall (the paid wall,
MNZ W3, keeps its own tighter bound when it lands).

Kill switch: REGWALL_ENABLED=0 in /etc/macro-api.env turns the wall off
(204 for everyone) without a deploy — the rollback lever if anything goes
sideways at the edge.

# Public funnel — everything else *.html is gated. Kept in code (not config):
# the list is the PRODUCT boundary, and moving a page across it should be a
# reviewed change, not an ops edit.
#
# EXACT public pages (the marketing funnel, plus the support desk).
#
# /support.html (SEE W2) is public by construction, not by convenience: the people
# who most need it are the ones who cannot sign in, so a contact form behind the
# registration wall would never receive the account/billing tickets it exists for.
# It ships no signals and no customer data, and its one write surface
# (POST /api/support/ticket) carries its own abuse posture in app/support.py.
#
# /about.html is the ENTITY page (research/SEO_SUPERCHARGE_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md
# §0.10). It is public for the same structural reason the legal pages are: a page
# whose whole job is to tell a stranger — and a crawler that has never had a
# session — who we are cannot sit behind a wall that asks them to prove who THEY
# are first. It ships no signals, no data and no write surface.
#
# /special_situations.html and /china_special_situations.html are TIER-PREVIEW
# SHELLS (docs/TIER_PREVIEW_PATTERN.md), promoted from free_registered to
# anonymous-public by SEO_SUPERCHARGE_MASTERPLAN W1a. The shell carries only the
# preview slice, the honest totals and the upgrade wall; every paid row ships in
# a separate payload (/premiumdata/*, plus /allocationdata/special_situations.json
# and /chinaspecialdata/special.json) that app/paywall.py enforces as Essential+
# regardless of PAYWALL_ENABLED. So opening the page opens no rows: the split is
# still the gate, and this wall was only ever costing us the crawl — Googlebot
# has no session, so it was being 302'd off the one desk with proven demand.
#
# /china_heatmap.html is the W2 heatmap conversion (spec:
# research/seo_supercharge/W2_HEATMAP_ETFS_PREVIEW_SPEC.md Part A). It is a THIRD
# shape: the shells above were already split, but this page shipped zero content —
# every tile, stat and mover was built in the browser — so opening the boundary
# alone would have given Googlebot a thin-content 200 instead of the 302 it gets
# today, which is a worse outcome because Google keeps it. The same PR
# server-renders the breadth/movers/sector summary so the page is worth the crawl.
# Nearly all of it is free by construction: a heatmap of market performance is
# market context. The one graded surface — our per-name read — arrives from
# <market>stockdata/<T>.json, which stays OUT of the public list above and
# therefore keeps 401ing anonymous asset requests here; the hover card renders a
# locked slot in its place. hk_heatmap/canada_heatmap run the same builder and
# join by adding one line each, here and in the other two mirrors.
#
# /etfs.html re-flipped 2026-08-03 per masterplan gate 6b: the walled shell is
# committed on main (verified 3 gate markers), so the public grant now points at
# a page that carries its wall. (History: #4426 flip outran the bake, #4446
# closed the ~1h leak, this restores it safely.) It is the same
# shape with one difference worth stating: the two desks above were ALREADY split
# and W1a moved only their access class, whereas etfs.html was fully server-
# rendered with every graded row in the markup, so the PR that opened it is also
# the PR that took those rows off the URL. The free shell keeps the fund coverage
# directory, the rotation backdrop and the honest totals; the consensus board,
# fresh conviction, per-fund adds and trims live in /premiumdata/etfs.json, which
# app/paywall.py enforces as Essential+ regardless of PAYWALL_ENABLED.
