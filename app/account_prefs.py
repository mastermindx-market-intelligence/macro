"""app/account_prefs.py — POST /api/account/prefs (SEE W3, masterplan R4).

``templates/account.js`` has been calling this route (debounced, on ``themechange`` and
``langchange``) since the account card shipped, and nothing implemented it server-side.
This is that implementation — the client is deployed, so the server matches the client:
a one-key body (``{"lang":"zh"}`` or ``{"theme":"dark"}``), fire-and-forget.

Two sinks, one request:

* **Supabase auth ``user_metadata``** — the durable home for a display preference, and
  what ``GET /api/account`` reads back so a signed-in visitor lands in their own theme and
  language on any device.
* **``email_prefs.lang``** — the mirror that makes single-language sends possible later
  without a migration (SEE-R4). Emails ship dual-language in v1; the column is the
  plumbing, filled now so it is populated when the switch is worth flipping.

Identity comes from the Bearer token ONLY (``app.main.require_user``, the same secretless
verification every authed route uses). Any ``user_id`` in the body is ignored — it is not
a field on the model and it is never read.

Analyst OS W3: the enum table and the GoTrue merge-write moved to ``lib/user_prefs.py``,
because the chat gateway now writes a preference too (``set_chat_preference`` — "answer
shorter from now on"). Two hand-rolled merge-writes is how one path clobbers the other's
key. This route keeps its own shape (400 with the offending field named, per-sink booleans,
the ``email_prefs`` mirror) and gains ``brain_depth`` on the body.
