"""macro API — FastAPI serving tier for the SaaS (Slice 2).

Minimal by design: health + overlay now; Supabase-JWT-gated routes activate the
moment ``SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`` is set in the service environment. This wraps the
existing build artifacts under /opt/macro — it does NOT recompute the engine.

DEPLOY NOTE (2026-07-23, CMX W4): this docstring touch intentionally rides with
the app/deploy/update.sh restart-trigger widening (brain_gateway/chart_perception/
doctrine) — main.py matches the OLD trigger regex still running on the box, so
this pull restarts macro-api and brings the already-merged W4 doctrine injection
live; the widened regex takes over from the next cron tick.

W8b PR2 — /api/ask and /api/ask/stream
---------------------------------------
POST /api/ask          — authed (require_user); interrogate the Neural Web brain
                         with a plain-language question.  Read tools only; write
                         tools structurally absent from the schema (Article 1).
POST /api/ask/stream   — SSE streaming variant of the same; tool-calling turns
                         run synchronously, final synthesis turn is streamed.

Live Options Flow Feed — /api/flow/*
--------------------------------------
GET /api/flow/feed          — unauthenticated; live-flow feed (events + unusual_names)
GET /api/flow/heat          — unauthenticated; per-sector/group heat map
GET /api/flow/meta          — unauthenticated; poller meta / cadence info
GET /api/flow/tide          — unauthenticated; market tide (NCP/NPP/gross/vol minute series)
GET /api/flow/dte           — unauthenticated; DTE-bucket tide (5 buckets)
GET /api/flow/ticker/{root} — unauthenticated; per-root drill (root sanitized [A-Z.]{1,8})

All are server-side read-throughs of the R2 live_flow/ objects with a 30-second
in-memory TTL cache.  On fetch failure the last-cached copy is returned with
{"stale":true} merged.  503 only if the object was never successfully fetched.

Options Hub analytics — /api/hub/* (routed from app/hub.py, lane B)
--------------------------------------
GET /api/hub/vol/{root}, /api/hub/gex/{root}, /api/hub/oi, /api/hub/hot
(loaded via try-import at module bottom; no-op if app/hub.py is absent)

KEY-OPTIONAL: when ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is absent from /etc/macro-api.env the
endpoints return mode='memo-quote' (degraded=True) — a relevant excerpt from
data/neuralweb/cortex/memo.json.  The operator arms live mode by adding
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to /etc/macro-api.env and restarting macro-api.service.

DEPLOY NOTE: the per-user/global quota ledger is written to MACRO_API_STATE_DIR
(default /var/lib/macro-api/).  The VPS setup must create this dir once:
    mkdir -p /var/lib/macro-api && chown root:root /var/lib/macro-api && chmod 700 /var/lib/macro-api

    """Every /api/* response is per-user — never let a shared cache keep one.

    FOUND LIVE (2026-07-25 Stripe go-live audit): macro-api sent NO Cache-Control on
    /api/*, so the EdgeOne edge applied its own default and cached **404** responses,
    with a cache key that IGNORES the Authorization header. `GET /api/billing/portal`
    404s for every user without a Stripe customer (i.e. every free user), and that 404
    was then replayed from the edge to PAYING subscribers — who saw "no billing account
    yet" and could not reach the billing portal at all (the only self-serve path to
    update a card, cancel, or downgrade). Reproduced twice with `eo-cache-status: HIT`.

    Measured scope at the time: 404 was cached; 401 and 200 were not — so /api/me and
    /api/account happened to be safe. That is a CDN heuristic, not a guarantee, and it
    can change under us. This removes the dependency entirely: the origin now states the
    caching rule for its own responses instead of leaving it to the edge.

    `setdefault` semantics — a route that already set Cache-Control (the SSE streams'
    `no-cache`, the regwall/paywall gates' `no-store`) keeps its own value.

    Deliberately a RAW ASGI middleware, not @app.middleware("http"): the latter is
    Starlette's BaseHTTPMiddleware, which wraps the response body in an anyio stream and
    has a long history of interfering with StreamingResponse. This app serves several
    long-lived SSE streams under /api/ — the brain lane and its re-attach stream
    (app/brain_runs.py) among them — and a header-only concern has no business in the
    body path for any of them. This touches exactly one dict on the `http.response.start`

    a gated navigation 302'd the visitor to /?signin=1&ret=…, and because the verdict
    was CACHED against their token, the landing's silent refresh could not clear it
    either — every retry for the next 10 minutes hit the poisoned entry, the client's
    45s wall-hop loop guard (templates/onboard.js) gave up, and a signed-in user with
    a perfectly renewable session got a credentials prompt.

    So: an HTTP answer that rejects the token is a VERDICT and is cached; a transport
    failure teaches us nothing about the token and must not be remembered. Both still
    DENY this request — fail-closed is unchanged, and no caller gets a session it
    didn't prove. The only thing that changes is how long a non-answer haunts a user.

#     in access logs and referrers) — hence a POST body, not `GET ?since=`.
#   * Per-user server state would mean a new Supabase table + RLS. It is not needed: the
#     prior snapshot is a display artifact the client already holds, so the server stays
#     stateless and stores NOTHING. A cross-device cursor is the named follow-up.
