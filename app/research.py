"""app/research.py — FastAPI router for the Research Vault serving tier (RV W2).

Mirrors ``app/hub.py`` (R2 read-through + TTL cache + ``{stale:true}`` idiom) for
the two PUBLIC routes, and the ``brain_gateway`` gate idiom (Supabase tier resolve
+ file-based day quota) for the three PAID routes. Contract: masterplan §9.

Routes
------
GET  /api/research/catalog            public  — latest 3 summaries; full catalog for Pro
GET  /api/research/search?q=&…        public  — preview-only results; full search for Pro
GET  /api/research/view/{doc_id}      PRO     — stream PDF inline (rate-limited, no quota)
POST /api/research/download/{doc_id}  PRO     — watermark + attachment (daily quota
                                                10/day; 50/day on a lifetime grant)
GET  /api/research/quota              authed  — read-only remaining today

SECURITY INVARIANTS (the red-team probes these — see the block above each guard):
  1. doc_id is validated to the slug shape ``^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,120}$`` AND must
     EXIST in the catalog before any R2 key is built. The key is
     ``f"research_vault/{doc_id}.pdf"`` built ONLY from the validated id — raw user
     input never reaches an R2 key. Blocks path traversal / key injection / prefix
     listing.
  2. Entitlement fails CLOSED: any error/absence resolving tier → 'free' → blocked
     (402). Reading is PRO-only — essential/free/unknown are NEVER granted view (402
     paid_required); Essential is a browse-and-teaser tier. (The download COUNTER
     fails OPEN per the availability rule in download_quota — deliberate asymmetry.)
  3. Server-authoritative quota: the 402 on exhaustion is returned regardless of
     client state; the counter increments only on a successful allow, before bytes.
  4. No public PDF path: PDFs come from the PRIVATE bucket via server creds; there
     is no public URL and no static route. view=inline, download=attachment; both
     ``no-store`` + ``noindex``.
  5. Never log/leak the bearer, Supabase keys, or R2 creds; never echo a raw IP
     into a filename (view_ratelimit hashes it).

Never-raise at the route boundary: every handler returns a proper HTTP status
(400/402/404/429/503), never a 500 stack.

         search could surface a report that the vault had not admitted and whose
         PDF may not exist. If visibility cannot be established at all (no valid
         catalog anywhere) the route reports ``available: False`` rather than
         answering from the corpus alone.
      2. **tier preview — non-Pro only.** Anonymous, free, and Essential callers

    Gate order (Wave 4, Defect 7 reordered steps 4-6 — see below):

      3. doc_id validate (400/404) BEFORE any R2 key.
      4. ``download_quota.peek`` — read-only. Exhausted → 402 WITHOUT fetching, so
         an exhausted caller can never be used to hammer R2.
      5. fetch PDF. Absent → 404 with the ledger UNTOUCHED.
      6. ``download_quota.check_and_increment`` — the authoritative debit, taken
         only once the bytes are in hand. A concurrent request that consumed the
         final slot between the peek and here is still refused: the increment,
         not the peek, is the server-authoritative gate.
      7. watermark with the buyer's identity, return as ``attachment`` ·
         ``private, no-store`` · ``X-Robots-Tag: noindex``.

    WHY the reorder: the debit used to happen BEFORE the fetch and was explicitly
    never refunded, so a missing object spent one of a paid subscriber's ten daily
    downloads and returned them nothing. That was rationalized as a rare
    just-deleted-document race — but Defect 5 in this same wave made missing PDFs
    PERSISTENT (a failed promotion still admitted the report to the catalog), which
    turns a rare race into a repeatable way to burn a paid allowance. Peek-then-
    fetch-then-debit removes the false debit without opening an unmetered fetch
    path, and needs no refund subsystem — there is nothing to refund.

    NOTE the deliberate asymmetry, unchanged: the tier resolve fails CLOSED
    (unknown→free→402) while the quota counter fails OPEN (broken ledger → allow,
    LOUD) — the first guards the paywall, the second guards a paid subscriber's
    availability. The peek inherits that: a ledger it cannot read reports the full
    allowance, so an outage never blocks a paying reader.
