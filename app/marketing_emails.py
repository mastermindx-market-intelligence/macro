"""app/marketing_emails.py — welcome mail + campaign drain (SEE W4, masterplan §4 W4).

Three legs on one in-process sweeper, all marketing-class, all default OFF:

  ``sweep_welcome``     behaviour-triggered welcome on signup (PIN §7.6)
  ``drain_campaigns``   send a queued ``email_campaigns`` row to its segment (PIN §7.9)
  ``drain_parked``      finish the rows W3's fail-closed suppression check parked

Shape is W3's (``app/billing_emails.py``): env-gated, registered from ``app/main.py``, an
asyncio loop that sleeps FIRST, each wake wrapped, work done in ``asyncio.to_thread``, and
carrying no cursor of its own — the eligible set is re-derived every wake and
``email_log``'s unique ``idem_key`` decides what has already gone out, so a restart
mid-sweep costs nothing.

That last part is exact rather than loose, because a campaign larger than one wake needs a
resume point and there is no column to put one in. The LEDGER is the cursor: ``mailer.send``
claims a row for every recipient it is offered, so ``campaign:{id}:*`` is a complete record
of who has been processed, and a wake skips those and starts its roster scan at the page
that provably cannot be past the first person still waiting (:func:`_resume_page`). A
campaign is marked ``done`` only when the roster has been walked to its END — anything less
is a truncation, and a ``done`` campaign is never selected again.

NOTHING SENDS WITHOUT A RELAY, AND NOTHING IS CLAIMED EITHER
------------------------------------------------------------
``mailer.send`` writes a TERMINAL ``skipped_no_smtp`` row when SMTP is unconfigured, which
spends the idem_key on a message that was never written: the retry answers ``duplicate``
and the person never hears from us. So the two sending legs REFUSE to run at all while
``mailer.is_configured()`` is false (:func:`_relay_ready`) rather than burning the window,
and :func:`drain_parked` picks up any row a pre-refusal build already burnt.

THE BLAST RADIUS, AND THE THREE BOUNDS ON IT
--------------------------------------------
"Every account with no ``welcome:{user_id}`` ledger row" is, on the first run, EVERY
ACCOUNT THAT HAS EVER EXISTED. The idempotency key protects against sending twice; it does
nothing whatsoever about sending once to ten thousand people who signed up last year. That
is the single largest risk in this lane, so the eligible set is bounded three ways and the
first two are hard gates, not tuning:

1. **An activation floor that must be set by hand.** ``MAIL_WELCOME_AFTER`` is an ISO
   date/time; only accounts created strictly after it are ever candidates. **Unset means
   ZERO candidates** — not "everyone", not "since boot". Arming ``MAIL_WELCOME_ENABLED``
   without also naming the day the feature went live therefore sends nothing at all, which
   is the correct behaviour for a half-finished rollout and the one that cannot be
   regretted.
2. **A lookback ceiling.** The floor is combined with ``now - MAIL_WELCOME_LOOKBACK_HOURS``
   (default 72h) and the LATER of the two wins. So even a correctly-set floor cannot mail
   a year of backlog if the sweeper was off for a year: a welcome email three months after
   signup is worse than no welcome email, and this makes that unsendable rather than
   merely unlikely.
3. **A per-wake cap.** :data:`_WELCOME_MAX_PER_WAKE` bounds one wake's sends regardless.

:func:`welcome_window` returns the pair actually in force and is what the test asserts;
nothing computes the bound a second time.

TWO PLANES, ONE SEGMENT DEFINITION
----------------------------------
This module runs in macro-api, which holds a **service-role** key and no Management PAT,
so it cannot run the admin console's SQL. It assembles the roster from the GoTrue admin
list + PostgREST instead. Membership is NOT re-derived here: ``app/email_segments.py``
declares each segment once, and this module evaluates the Python half of that same pair.

SUPPRESSION IS CHECKED AT SEND TIME, NOT AT QUEUE TIME
------------------------------------------------------
Nothing here pre-filters unsubscribers out of a segment and calls that compliance.
``mailer.send(cls='marketing')`` re-reads ``email_suppression`` and
``email_prefs.marketing_opt_out`` for every single recipient, immediately before the relay
is touched, and is fail-closed if that read errors. A campaign queued at 09:00 and drained
at 09:40 cannot reach someone who unsubscribed at 09:20. The counters report what actually
happened — ``skipped_n`` counts the people we did not mail, and a campaign that skips half
its segment says so.

      exhaustion (a campaign).

    Those rows sit at ``status='queued', detail='suppression_lookup_failed'``: the ledger
    claimed the idem_key, so the message can never go out through :func:`mailer.send`
    again — a second call would hit the unique constraint and return ``'duplicate'``
    without sending anything. The claimed row IS the work item and it is completed IN
    PLACE: re-check suppression, then either PATCH it to ``suppressed`` or rebuild the
    message and hand it straight to the transport, PATCHing the same row to its terminal
    status.

    Rebuilding is possible because ``email_log`` stores no body: the content of both
    templates this module owns is a pure function of an identity (``welcome:{user_id}``)
    or of a campaign row (``campaign:{id}:{user_id}``). A parked row from any OTHER
    template is left alone and logged — guessing at content nobody stored would be a
    worse outcome than a row an operator has to look at.

    TWO KINDS OF STRANDED ROW, and the second one is the recovery lane
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    ``status='queued', detail='suppression_lookup_failed'`` is W3's park, above.
    ``status='skipped_no_smtp'`` is the OTHER one: a terminal row whose idem_key is spent
    and whose message was never written, produced by any send attempted while the relay
    was off. :func:`_relay_ready` stops the welcome and campaign legs from creating more
    of them, but rows created before that landed still exist, and nothing would ever have
    looked at them again — the message was simply gone. So once a relay exists they are
    re-offered exactly like a parked row: suppression re-checked, message rebuilt,
    transport handed the result, THIS row PATCHed. While there is still no relay they are
    not selected at all, because re-skipping them is work with no outcome.

    The gates are the LEG's gates, per row. A parked welcome is only completed when the
    welcome leg is armed and a parked campaign only when campaigns are — the same switches

    merely late.
