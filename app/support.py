"""app/support.py — public support-ticket intake (SEE W1, masterplan §5).

One route, deliberately:

    POST /api/support/ticket   — unauthenticated; file a support request.

It is the only *public write* surface on macro-api besides the Stripe webhook, so the
abuse posture is the design, not a decoration:

  * **honeypot** — a ``website`` field that a human never sees and never fills. Non-empty
    means a bot; we answer 200 with a well-formed body and write NOTHING (a 400 would
    teach the bot which field betrayed it).
  * **time-to-fill** — ``t0`` is the epoch-ms the form was rendered. A submission under
    3 seconds old was not typed by a person. Generic 400.
  * **dual-key rate limit** — a caller that reaches the origin directly (ufw permits
    80,443/tcp from Anywhere) can set any forwarding header it likes, so a bot that
    rotates one lands every hit in a fresh bucket. Two independent in-process fixed
    windows, and EITHER can refuse:
      - the CLAIMED ip (``app.main._mm_client_ip``) at 5/hour — tight, and spoofable
        only from OFF the edge since 2026-08-07: the resolver now reads just the header
        the edge overwrites, so a bot arriving through the edge cannot rotate this key
        at all (it used to prefer four headers the edge forwards verbatim). Direct-to-
        origin it is still caller-chosen, which is what the peer key below is for;
      - the TRUSTED peer (``X-MM-Peer``, which Caddy's ``header_up`` overwrites with the
        real TCP peer, so a client cannot set it) at 60/hour — unspoofable, but loose,
        because CN traffic legitimately aggregates behind a few EdgeOne edge IPs.
    An absent key simply does not apply; it is no longer a free pass, because the other
    key still does.
  * **size caps** — subject ≤ 200, message ≤ 5000. The declared-Content-Length check here
    is a cheap early refusal only: a chunked request declares no length, so the REAL cap
    is ``request_body { max_size 64KB }`` on ``/api/support/*`` in app/deploy/Caddyfile —
    the edge is the only place that sits before the body is read.

Header safety: the subject is whitespace-collapsed to a single line BEFORE length
validation, so an embedded CRLF can never reach an email header (app/mailer.py collapses
again at the chokepoint). Left unhandled this is not a garbled message but a permanent
outage for that ticket: every reply's subject is derived from the stored one.

Identity law: a Bearer token, when present and valid, WINS. The server-verified email
replaces whatever the body claimed and the ticket carries the real ``user_id`` plus a
tier snapshot read through the billing spine. A client-sent user id is never trusted and
is not even accepted. An INVALID/expired bearer does not 401 — the form is public, so we
simply file the ticket as signed-out rather than making a user retype it because their
session lapsed.

Privacy: the row stores the user agent and a keyed, truncated HASH of the client IP. The
raw IP is never written — abuse triage needs "was this the same submitter", not an
address.

Mail-off safe: both sends go through app/mailer.py, which returns a status string and
never raises. A dead relay produces a ledger row and a filed ticket, never a 500 at the
user.

Persist first, mail after (SEE W2 / reviewer M4). The two sends — the operator alert and
the submitter's acknowledgment — run in a FastAPI ``BackgroundTasks`` job, AFTER the
response is written. Precisely what that buys:

  * **the submitter waits on the insert, not on the relay.** With SMTP inline, a stalled
    relay costs up to ``_SMTP_TIMEOUT × _SEND_ATTEMPTS`` (~24s today, and more if those
    timeouts are ever relaxed) BEFORE the browser hears anything. Now the response is
    written in milliseconds and the relay is talked to afterwards.
  * **``ok: true`` keeps its literal meaning:** the ticket is STORED. The email is a
    consequence of that, never a precondition for it, and a mail job that explodes
    downstream cannot unmake the row.

What it does NOT buy is threadpool isolation — an earlier version of this docstring
claimed it did, and that was wrong. Starlette runs a *sync* background task through
``run_in_threadpool`` → ``anyio.to_thread.run_sync``, i.e. the SAME default 40-token
capacity limiter that serves every sync route. The work moved off the REQUEST, not off the
pool. What actually bounds how many mail jobs can be in flight is the rate limiter below:
``RATE_LIMIT`` per claimed IP and ``PEER_RATE_LIMIT`` per trusted Caddy peer, per hour.

Honest about mail (SEE W2 review). The response carries ``mail`` — whether a relay is
configured at this moment — because the estate ships dark until SMTP credentials land
(docs/ops/email-support-setup.md) and, with the sends deferred, a response structurally
cannot know their disposition. /support.html reads it to decide whether it may say a copy
was emailed. It never gates the ticket: a filed request is filed either way.
