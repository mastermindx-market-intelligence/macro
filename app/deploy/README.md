# Deploy runbook — mastermind-x.com static origin (Slice 1)

Stands up the existing prebuilt `site/` on the DigitalOcean droplet
(`146.190.142.17`), served by Caddy behind Cloudflare, on **mastermind-x.com**.
This is the *additive serving tier* from `research/SAAS_MVP_PLAN.md` — it reads the
nightly build artifacts and changes nothing in the build pipeline.

**Status:** Slice 1 = serve the site over HTTPS (pre-launch, `noindex`). Product login
(Supabase) + API are Slice 2.

---

## Step 1 — grant SSH access (the one manual unblock)

The droplet only accepts SSH keys and none of the local keys are authorized yet.
Authorize the deploy key via the DigitalOcean **web console** (no SSH needed):

1. DigitalOcean → **Droplets** → your droplet → **Access** → **Launch Droplet Console**
   (opens a root terminal in the browser). If it asks for a root password you don't
   have, click **Reset Root Password** first (DO emails a new one), then log in.
2. In that console, paste this one line (this is the public half of
   `~/.ssh/macro_dashboard_deploy_v2` — safe to share; the private key never leaves the Mac):

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && echo 'ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIEvwuDp7Wk+GYlooJjQl/0OPfubiCtSKswsNbIqQibX7 macro-dashboard-local-20260611' >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && echo KEY_ADDED
   ```

That's it — once it prints `KEY_ADDED`, the agent can SSH in with
`ssh -i ~/.ssh/macro_dashboard_deploy_v2 root@146.190.142.17` and run everything below.

## Step 2 — Cloudflare settings (in the CF dashboard)

1. **DNS** → ensure an **A record**: `mastermind-x.com` → `146.190.142.17`, **Proxied**
   (orange cloud). Add `www` the same way (or a CNAME `www` → `mastermind-x.com`).
2. **SSL/TLS → Overview** → set encryption mode to **Full**
   (NOT "Full (strict)" — the origin uses Caddy's self-signed cert; strict would reject it).
3. (Optional, recommended for a private beta) **Zero Trust → Access → Applications** →
   add `mastermind-x.com` as a self-hosted app with an email-OTP policy. Instant
   zero-code login wall until the Supabase product auth ships in Slice 2.

## Step 3 — provision (agent runs this once Step 1 is done)

The canonical repo is private (DEC:B1-MACRO-PRIVATE-CUTOVER). The droplet needs a
read-only deploy key installed at `/root/.ssh/macro_ro_selfupdate` first (provisioned
out of band — never embedded in this repo), then self-clones over the governed
authenticated remote — see `app/deploy/setup.sh`'s header comment for the exact
one-shot command, or once a checkout already exists:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/macro_dashboard_deploy_v2 root@146.190.142.17 \
  'bash /opt/macro/app/deploy/setup.sh'
```

`setup.sh` is idempotent: installs Caddy, clones the repo to `/opt/macro`, installs the
Caddyfile, opens the firewall, starts Caddy, and adds a nightly `macro-update` cron that
`git pull`s the freshly-built site (~23:30 UTC weekdays, after the daily build lands).

### Install the live plane

After the base site/API is provisioned:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/macro_dashboard_deploy_v2 root@146.190.142.17 \
  'bash /opt/macro/app/deploy/live-setup.sh'
```

This installs three resource-bounded systemd lanes and publishes their browser
artifacts under `/var/lib/macro-live/public`. See
[`docs/VPS_LIVE_ORCHESTRATION.md`](../../docs/VPS_LIVE_ORCHESTRATION.md) for
ownership, capacity, validation, and cutover details. Do not set the repository
variable `VPS_LIVE_PRIMARY=true` until the timers have passed a full-session soak.

### Private option-OI availability canary

`api-setup.sh` and `macro-update` also provision the W1B.5 option-OI source
availability canary. It uses a static non-login identity, a root-owned mode-0710
parent plus disjoint service-owned mode-0700 profile at
`/var/lib/macro-market-memory-options/options-v1`, and the fixed systemd
credential `massive-option-oi-api-key`. The timer remains disabled if that
credential cannot be safely rebound from existing private operator state, if
the reviewed units drift, or until a verified `macro-api` PID transition has
placed the API behind non-optional store and credential deny mounts. The
runtime receipt binds both MainPID and systemd InvocationID, and the oneshot
rechecks it plus the exact reciprocal service/timer fragments before each
request. Sensitive
service-writable state and the credential file are provisioned only after that
API fence exists; fresh hosts create only empty root-owned deny-anchor
directories before the first unit verification/restart.

This is intentionally one first-page source probe—not a complete chain, OI
surface, GEX builder, replay input, or public/API feature. See
[`docs/ops/market-memory-option-oi-canary.md`](../../docs/ops/market-memory-option-oi-canary.md)
for scope, isolation, rotation, and live verification.

### Attach Codex to the production provider pool

`api-setup.sh` and `macro-update` install the pinned official Codex CLI through
`codex-runtime-setup.sh`. Authentication is machine-local state, not a repository
secret. Each ChatGPT account gets its own root-only `CODEX_HOME`; authorize the
three accounts independently:

```bash
ssh -tt -i ~/.ssh/macro_dashboard_deploy_v2 root@146.190.142.17 \
  'CODEX_HOME=/var/lib/macro-codex codex login --device-auth'

ssh -tt -i ~/.ssh/macro_dashboard_deploy_v2 root@146.190.142.17 \
  'CODEX_HOME=/var/lib/macro-codex-2 codex login --device-auth'

ssh -tt -i ~/.ssh/macro_dashboard_deploy_v2 root@146.190.142.17 \
  'CODEX_HOME=/var/lib/macro-codex-3 codex login --device-auth'
```

Complete the one-time code at `https://auth.openai.com/codex/device`, then verify:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/macro_dashboard_deploy_v2 root@146.190.142.17 \
  'CODEX_HOME=/var/lib/macro-codex codex login status && \
   CODEX_HOME=/var/lib/macro-codex-2 codex login status && \
   CODEX_HOME=/var/lib/macro-codex-3 codex login status'
```

The deployed services expose all three stores through `CODEX_ACCOUNT_HOMES`.
Model Desk reports them as `codex_account`, `codex_account_2`, and
`codex_account_3`; the provider router prefers the healthy account with the
lower observed quota-window load.
Their Claude OAuth credentials remain in their respective root-only environment
files; no login cache or refresh token is copied from the Mac or into Git.

## Step 4 — verify

```bash
# origin answers (self-signed -> -k):
curl -ksI https://146.190.142.17/ | head -5
# public domain via Cloudflare:
curl -sI https://mastermind-x.com/ | head -10        # expect 200 + x-robots-tag: noindex
```

## Press properties (W1.5) — cutover runbook

The two press publications (`mastermindx.ai`, `blog.mastermind-x.com`) ship
**dark**: the static trees are built and synced to the box, and nothing serves
them until the cutover. The serving half lives in `Caddyfile` between the
`PRESS-CUTOVER-BEGIN` / `PRESS-CUTOVER-END` marker lines, fully commented out.

`update.sh` already rsyncs `properties/news` → `/opt/macro/press_news.served`
and `properties/research` → `/opt/macro/press_research.served` on every repo
update (same atomic-rename + `--min-size=1` protections as `site.served`), so by
cutover day the content is already on disk.

**Do these in order. DNS first — the config half without the DNS half is a
claim nobody verified.**

1. **DNS (Spaceship, the registrar for both zones).** Add A records pointing at
   the droplet:

   | Host | Type | Value |
   |---|---|---|
   | `mastermindx.ai` (`@`) | A | `146.190.142.17` |
   | `www.mastermindx.ai` | A | `146.190.142.17` |
   | `blog.mastermind-x.com` | A | `146.190.142.17` |

   `www` still needs its own A record even though it only redirects — it has to
   terminate TLS before it can serve the 301, so Caddy needs to reach it over
   HTTP-01 to issue a certificate. The apex is the canonical host (it is what
   `config/press.yml` `base_url` names); www 301s to it.

   These are **grey-cloud / direct** records — no CDN in front, exactly like
   `admin.mastermind-x.com`. Caddy will therefore issue **real Let's Encrypt**
   certificates over HTTP-01 (never `tls internal` for these hosts). Verify
   before moving on:

   ```bash
   dig +short mastermindx.ai www.mastermindx.ai blog.mastermind-x.com
   # expect 146.190.142.17 three times
   ```

2. **The cutover PR — one commit, both halves.** `config/press.yml` `cutover:`
   flips to `true` **and** the marked Caddyfile block gets uncommented, in the
   same commit. `tests/test_press_properties.py` asserts the pairing in both
   directions, so a PR carrying only one half goes red.

   Uncomment mechanically rather than by hand (this strips one leading `#` from
   every line *between* the markers and leaves the marker lines themselves
   commented, which is what the guard expects):

   ```bash
   python3 - <<'PY'
   import pathlib
   p = pathlib.Path("app/deploy/Caddyfile")
   lines = p.read_text(encoding="utf-8").splitlines()
   b = lines.index("# PRESS-CUTOVER-BEGIN")
   e = lines.index("# PRESS-CUTOVER-END")
   lines[b+1:e] = [l[1:] if l.startswith("#") else l for l in lines[b+1:e]]
   p.write_text("\n".join(lines) + "\n", encoding="utf-8")
   PY
   caddy validate --config app/deploy/Caddyfile --adapter caddyfile
   ```

3. **Merge.** The box's `macro-update` cron pulls within 3 minutes.
   `update.sh` gates the Caddy reload on `caddy validate`, so a bad config can
   never take the site down — it refuses the install and logs why. ACME issues
   the two certificates within seconds of the reload, because DNS already points
   here (step 1).

4. **Verify live.**

   ```bash
   curl -sI https://mastermindx.ai/ | head -5              # expect 200
   curl -sI https://blog.mastermind-x.com/ | head -5       # expect 200
   curl -sI http://mastermindx.ai/ | head -3               # expect 301 -> https
   curl -sI https://www.mastermindx.ai/ | head -3          # expect 301 -> apex
   curl -s  https://mastermindx.ai/robots.txt              # expect the Sitemap line
   ```

5. **HSTS ramp — a week later, not on cutover day.** Both vhosts ship
   `Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=300"`. That is deliberate: HSTS is the
   one header a browser will not let you withdraw — a client that has cached a
   long `max-age` refuses plain http for that host until it expires, so a cert
   or DNS mistake on a brand-new domain becomes unreachable-by-design. Five
   minutes is real protection and a survivable mistake.

   After the properties have served a clean week (valid certs, no mixed
   content, no redirect loops), raise **both** blocks — and the `www` redirect
   block — to `max-age=31536000` in a follow-up PR. This step is not paired to
   anything; it is a one-line change with no config counterpart.

**Rollback:** revert the cutover PR. That re-comments the Caddy block and puts
`cutover: false` back in one move — which is exactly why the two halves are
pinned together. The DNS records can stay pointed at the box; with the block
commented, those hosts fall through to the port-80 catch-all and serve nothing.

**What flipping `cutover` changes on the publishing side:** `scripts/run_press.py
--emit` stops writing new pieces to `content/seo/blog` + the `/blog/` estate for
any publication that carries a `property_tree`, and writes them to that
publication's `content_dir` + property tree instead. Historic ledger rows are
never migrated — each row carries the URL it was actually published at.

## Admin per-client identity behind the edge — ONE console step still owed

**Status: the origin half is deployed; the EdgeOne half is an operator action.** Until
that action is taken the admin login lockout keeps behaving exactly as it did before
the fix — safe, but still one shared bucket for edge-borne traffic.

**The problem.** `admin.mastermind-x.com` is edge-proxied, so the TCP peer Caddy sees
(`header_up X-Admin-Client-IP {remote_host}`) is an EdgeOne origin-pull address, not the
visitor. `admin/auth.py` keys its login lockout on that value, so every visitor arriving
through the edge shared ONE bucket: five wrong passwords from anywhere on the internet
locked the operator out of their own console, and kept it locked. `admin/edge_trust.py`
fixes it by resolving the real visitor behind an *attested* edge peer — but attesting the
peer needs something the caller cannot forge, because ufw permits `80,443/tcp` from
Anywhere and anyone can hit the origin directly with whatever headers they like.

**Why a CIDR allowlist is not the answer here.** The credential-free published range list
(`https://api.edgeone.ai/ips`) was deprecated 2026-07-31 and now answers HTTP 200 with a
deprecation notice followed by the literal payload `0.0.0.0/0` and `::/0` — ingesting it
blindly would trust the entire internet. Its successor (`DescribeOriginACL`) needs Tencent
Cloud SecretId/SecretKey, which this infrastructure does not hold. So the shipped default
allowlist is empty, the loader hard-refuses blanket ranges, and the **shared secret below
is the intended mechanism**. Details and evidence: `config/edgeone_origin_ranges.json`.

**The step.** Give the edge a secret to prove itself with:

1. Read the secret (do NOT commit it anywhere). `setup-admin.sh` provisions it — on
   both a fresh box and an existing one — so this should already print a 48-char hex
   value; if it prints nothing, re-run `admin/deploy/setup-admin.sh`:
   ```
   ssh root@146.190.142.17 'grep ADMIN_EDGE_SECRET /etc/macro-admin.env'
   ```
   To rotate, replace the value there, `systemctl restart admin`, then update the
   console rule in step 2 — in that order, since the old secret keeps working until
   the restart.
2. EdgeOne console → the `mastermind-x.com` site → **Rules Engine** → new rule:
   * **IF** HOST equals `admin.mastermind-x.com`
   * **THEN** *Modify origin-pull request header* → **Set** header `X-MM-Edge-Auth`
     to that value.
3. Confirm it took effect. **Log in to the console first** — the probe is an
   authenticated route, because it is the only one that reports the resolved identity:
   ```
   curl -s https://admin.mastermind-x.com/api/site_gate \
        -H "Cookie: admin_session=<your session cookie>" | python3 -m json.tool | grep your_ip
   ```
   `your_ip` must be **your own public IP**. A `43.x` address means the rule did not
   take effect and the console is still on the shared bucket.

   Do **not** try to confirm this from `journalctl -u admin` or from `/api/session`:
   the handler sets `log_message` to a no-op so there is no per-request log line, and
   `/api/session` never resolves a client identity. Both would look "fine" for a rule
   that silently failed.

**Second thing this fixes.** `_real_client_ip()` feeds `site_gate.save_rules()`, which
auto-allows the operator's IP so a gate edit cannot lock them out. Unresolved, that entry
auto-allows an *edge* address — i.e. every visitor sharing that node. The same attestation
makes it mean "the operator" again.

**If you ever add a header here,** read `admin/edge_trust.py` first. Measured 2026-08-07
by probing the live host through the edge with every real-client header forged:
`EO-Connecting-IP` is the only one the edge overwrites. `EO-Client-IP`, `True-Client-IP`,
`X-Real-IP` and `CF-Connecting-IP` all arrived carrying the forged values, and a clean
edge request carries no `EO-Client-IP` at all. Trusting any of those would replace an
operator-lockout DoS with unlimited brute-force bucket rotation.

**The `EO-Client-IP` finding above is about `admin.*` only.** Re-probing
`www.mastermind-x.com` the same way (2026-08-07, headers captured off the loopback hop
to `:8000`) found the EdgeOne "Client IP Header" rule IS active on that zone: a clean
www request carries `EO-Client-IP`, and a forged copy arrives overwritten with the true
client. The zones are configured differently, so neither table generalises — re-probe
whichever one you are editing. Measured on www:

| header sent through the edge | arrived at the origin as |
|---|---|
| `EO-Connecting-IP: 203.0.113.13` | `104.36.50.44` — OVERWRITTEN, true client |
| `EO-Client-IP: 203.0.113.11, .12` | `104.36.50.44` — OVERWRITTEN, single value |
| `-Client-IPCountry: XX` | `US` — OVERWRITTEN, true country |
| `EO-Client-IPCountry: XX` | `XX` — passed through, FORGED (edge never sets it) |
| `True-Client-IP` / `X-Real-IP` / `CF-Connecting-IP` / `CF-IPCountry` | passed through, FORGED |
| `X-Forwarded-For: 198.51.100.7` | `43.175.104.147` — dropped by the edge, Caddy re-set it to the peer |

Two consequences, both now handled in code. The public resolver `app/edge_client.py`
reads only `EO-Connecting-IP` (the one row that holds on *both* zones) and then falls
back to the Caddy-injected `X-MM-Peer` — never to the four forgeable headers, which the
old `app/main.py::_mm_client_ip` preferred ahead of it. And `app/gate.py` now reads
`-Client-IPCountry` *before* the configured `EO-Client-IPCountry`, because the edge sets
the former and not the latter: country blocking was reading a header any caller can set
while ignoring the real one. The gate ships disabled, so that half was latent.

The missing `EO` prefix on `-Client-IPCountry` looks like a console-rule quirk. If it is
ever corrected upstream the header simply goes absent and the configured name answers on
the next rung, so the shipped order is right before and after such a fix.

## Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `setup.sh` | idempotent provisioning (run as root on the droplet) |
| `Caddyfile` | serves `/opt/macro/site.served` plus the external live plane; carries the commented press-cutover vhosts |
| `update.sh` | `git pull` + Caddy reload (installed as `/usr/local/bin/macro-update`, cron'd); publishes `site.served` and the two `press_*.served` trees |
| `codex-runtime-setup.sh` | pins the official Codex CLI and prepares its root-only VPS state directory |
| `live-setup.sh` | installs the fast, full-snapshot, and intraday-bar systemd lanes |
| `macro-sentinel.service` + `.timer` | external freshness sentinel (masterplan W1 dead-man switch) plus the GATE-4 commercial-path pass — same unit, same `/etc/macro-sentinel.env` Telegram/Discord/email transport, no new vendor. Freshness still owns unit status; commercial-path is the leading `ExecStart=-` so a freshness breach cannot skip the money-path page |
| `macro-user-backup.service` + `.timer` | encrypted nightly dump of the nine customer/billing tables to private R2 (MMX-001 / GATE-1) — self-armed by `update.sh` on the API box; restore is operator-only against a scratch project, see `docs/RESTORE_RUNBOOK.md` |
| `live-rollback.sh` | disables the live lanes, restores legacy cron, and preserves artifacts in a backup |

## Notes / gotchas

- **DO cloud firewall:** if the droplet is attached to a DO *cloud* firewall (separate
  from `ufw`), open 22/80/443 there too — `setup.sh` can't change that (dashboard only).
- **CF "Full" vs "Full (strict)":** self-signed origin needs **Full**. Upgrade path:
  install a Cloudflare Origin Certificate and switch `tls internal` →
  `tls /etc/ssl/cf-origin.pem /etc/ssl/cf-origin.key`, then set CF to "Full (strict)".
- **Disk:** the public repo carries `site/` (~395 MB) + `data/` (~367 MB); a depth-1
  clone is ~1 GB. Fine on a standard droplet; `data/` is already there for the Slice-2 API.
- **Pre-launch exposure:** the site is `noindex` but still publicly reachable until you add
  the Cloudflare Access gate (Step 2.3) or the Supabase login (Slice 2). Add the gate before
  sharing the URL if you don't want the full product open.

### Alert delivery drain (macro-alert-drain.service/.timer)

Off-render fired-alert delivery lane (packet B-F08-1b). Drains `public.alert_outbox`
every 5 minutes (`OnCalendar=*:0/5`) and writes two-phase `public.alert_runs` receipts.
User-visible latency budget: 15 minutes p95 from fire to send (three ticks: one to
pick it up, two of slack). Ships DORMANT behind `ALERT_DRAIN_ENABLE=1` in
`/etc/macro-api.env` -- until set, `python -m scripts.drain_alert_outbox` forces
`--dry-run` (decisions only, no sends, no writes). Enabling live sends requires a
separate opus privacy/risk review (F08 architecture freeze section 10 V4) -- this packet
is not that review.

Reach it: `python -m scripts.drain_alert_outbox --dry-run` (any checkout, any host);
`systemctl list-timers macro-alert-drain.timer`; `systemctl start
macro-alert-drain.service`; `journalctl -u macro-alert-drain.service -n 50`. No public
route -- this lane has no user-facing surface.
