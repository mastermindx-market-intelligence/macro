# attacks, or pulling the noindex product around the CF edge / WAF / DDoS protection).
# SSH (22) stays open (key-only — password auth is off). Macro outbound (git pull, Yahoo,
# Polygon) is unaffected (default allow outgoing).
#
# FAIL-OPEN by construction: CF ranges are fetched + validated BEFORE the firewall is touched,
# and `ufw reset` leaves ufw DISABLED until re-enabled — so any error leaves the box reachable
# (just unprotected), never locked out. A monthly cron re-runs this to track CF range changes.
