# Site Access Gate — operator guide

The site-access gate lets the operator block specific IPs, IP ranges (CIDRs), or
whole countries from reaching the HTML pages of mastermind-x.com.  Blocked visitors
see a bilingual coming-soon page (site/coming-soon.html).

## What it does

The gate is enforced at the origin (macro-api) and consulted by Caddy for every
HTML navigation (paths `/` and `*.html`).  Assets (JS, CSS, images, JSON, fonts)
are NOT gated — the coming-soon page is fully self-contained and needs no assets.

Components:

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `app/gate.py` | Gate decision engine: loads rules, checks IP/country, returns allow/block |
| `admin/site_gate.py` | Admin backend: validates and persists rule changes |
| `app/deploy/Caddyfile` | Consults the gate for HTML requests; fail-open on upstream error |
| `site/coming-soon.html` | Fully self-contained 403 page (no external deps) |
| `app/deploy/geoip-setup.sh` | Downloads the MaxMind GeoLite2-Country db (optional) |

## Default state: SAFE (disabled)

The gate ships disabled (`enabled: false`).  When disabled, **every visitor is
allowed** regardless of any lists.  A missing, unreadable, or corrupt store file
is also treated as disabled (fail-open).

The admin panel's master switch defaults to OFF; the operator must explicitly enable
the gate before any blocking takes effect.

## Store file

The runtime blocklist is stored at `SITE_GATE_STATE` (default
`/var/lib/macro-api/site_gate.json`).  This file:

* Is NOT in git — it is ephemeral operational state (survives `git reset --hard`).
* Is written atomically (tempfile + os.replace) by the admin server.
* Is read by macro-api on every check, cached by mtime so changes take effect
  immediately without a restart.

Schema:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "enabled": false,
  "blocked_ips": ["203.0.113.4", "198.51.100.0/24"],
  "blocked_countries": ["RU", "KP"],
  "allow_ips": ["203.0.113.9"],
  "updated_at": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "updated_by": "admin"
}
```

## Fail-open: the gate can NEVER break the site

The gate is designed so that failures make it MORE permissive, not less:

1. **Missing/corrupt store** → treated as `{enabled:false}` → allow everyone.
2. **gate module unavailable** → main.py falls back to allow (204) with no gate check.
3. **Caddy: gate upstream down** → the gate `reverse_proxy` inside the
   `handle @gate_html { route { … } }` block errors; Caddy's `handle_errors`
   block serves the requested static HTML with a forced `200` → the page is served
   normally, never a `502` white-page (which EdgeOne could surface as its own error
   page). Verified with a local Caddy + stub-gate test across all cases: allow →
   200 page (`max-age=60`); block → 403 coming-soon (`no-store`); genuine 404 → 404;
   gate down → 200 page. **If you change the Caddyfile gate/route/handle_errors
   shape, re-run that test** — an earlier `handle` + `handle_response @blocked`
   shape shipped INERT (the gate was never consulted; blocklist did nothing).
4. **country = None** (header absent, no GeoIP) → ALLOW even if country blocklist
   is non-empty.  You cannot accidentally block all traffic by enabling a country
   list without a working detection source (the admin panel's country-detection
   badge shows `unavailable` until a real request resolves a country).

## Self-lockout guard

`allow_ips` is a whitelist that takes precedence over every block rule.  The admin
server always auto-inserts the operator's current IP into `allow_ips` on every
save, and warns (but still saves) if that IP is also in `blocked_ips`.  It is
**impossible** to lock yourself out via the admin panel.

## Country detection: CDN header (primary)

The CDN must emit a country header.  The gate reads, in order:

1. `-Client-IPCountry` — the name the edge actually sets on www (note the missing
   `EO` prefix; it is not a typo here, see below)
2. `SITE_GATE_COUNTRY_HEADER` env (default `EO-Client-IPCountry` for EdgeOne)
3. `EO-Client-Country`
4. `CF-IPCountry` (Cloudflare fallback)

**Rung 1 is first because only rung 1 is trustworthy.**  Measured on www 2026-08-07
(probe through the live edge, headers captured off the loopback hop to `:8000`): the
edge sets `-Client-IPCountry` and REPLACES a forged copy of that name with the true
country, while `EO-Client-IPCountry`, `EO-Client-Country` and `CF-IPCountry` are set
by nothing and arrive carrying whatever the caller sent — even through the edge.  With
the configured name checked first, as it was until this change, any visitor could
defeat country blocking with one request header while the genuine signal sat unread.
Rungs 2–4 are kept as fallbacks for a differently-configured zone; they are only as
good as the caller, so do not promote one above rung 1.

The missing `EO` prefix looks like a console-rule quirk.  If it is corrected upstream,
rung 1 simply goes absent and rung 2 (now genuinely edge-set) answers — the order is
right before and after such a fix, which is why it is hardcoded rather than configured.

### EdgeOne console setup

To enable country detection with EdgeOne:

1. Open the EdgeOne console → your domain → **Edge Functions** (or **Rules**).
2. Add a rule that forwards the visitor's country to the origin as
   `EO-Client-IPCountry`.  EdgeOne's "Client Country/Region" variable (e.g.
   `${geo_country}` in a rule action) can be mapped to a custom request header.
3. Verify that the header reaches the origin: check `/api/gate/status` and
   confirm `last_seen_country` is populated after a real visitor request.

The exact header name varies by EdgeOne product version.  Use `/api/gate/status`
→ `country_detection.source` to confirm which source the gate is actually reading.
If `source` is `"unavailable"`, the CDN is not forwarding a country header and
GeoIP is absent — **or the gate is simply disabled**, which short-circuits `decide()`
before any country is resolved, so `source` stays `"unavailable"` on a healthy zone.
Read that field as evidence only while `enabled` is true.

To see what the edge really sends without guessing, capture the origin-side headers
directly (this is how the table above was produced):

```
ssh root@146.190.142.17 'timeout 60 tcpdump -i lo -A -s0 -w /tmp/p.pcap "tcp port 8000"'
curl -s "https://www.mastermind-x.com/api/gate/check?probe=X" -H 'EO-Client-IPCountry: XX'
```

then read the request head out of `/tmp/p.pcap`.  A header the edge sets survives the
forgery; one it does not set arrives exactly as you typed it.

## Country detection: GeoIP (fallback)

If no CDN country header is present, the gate can optionally look up the country
from the visitor's IP using a MaxMind GeoLite2-Country database.  This is entirely
optional — the gate works without it.

Setup:

```bash
# 1. Get a free MaxMind account and licence key at:
#    https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup
# 2. Run geoip-setup.sh with the key:
MAXMIND_LICENSE_KEY=your_key bash /opt/macro/app/deploy/geoip-setup.sh
```

The db is written to `GEOIP_DB` (default `/var/lib/macro-api/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb`).
The gate re-opens it lazily on the next request — no restart needed.

Add a weekly cron to keep it current (MaxMind updates GeoLite2 twice a week):

```cron
0 4 * * 0  MAXMIND_LICENSE_KEY=<key> bash /opt/macro/app/deploy/geoip-setup.sh >> /var/log/geoip-setup.log 2>&1
```

## Security note: soft gate (header spoofing)

IP and country blocking via CDN headers is a **soft gate**.  A determined actor
hitting the origin server directly (bypassing the CDN) can spoof any header.  This
is consistent with the existing `noindex` + Supabase auth posture — the gate is
intended to deter casual access from certain regions, not to provide cryptographic
security.  For hard enforcement, use a CDN-level WAF rule or firewall to block
direct origin access (the existing `firewall-cloudflare.sh` locks the origin to
CDN IPs only, which makes header spoofing impossible from public internet).
