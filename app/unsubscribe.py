"""app/unsubscribe.py — the public unsubscribe endpoint (SEE W4, masterplan R5).

``POST /api/email/unsubscribe`` — **public and unauthenticated by design.** The person
clicking this link is, very often, precisely the person who cannot or will not sign in;
requiring a session to stop email would make the unsubscribe a dark pattern and would
break RFC 8058 one-click, which no mail client can authenticate. Authorisation comes from
the token instead: an HMAC over the identity with ``MAIL_UNSUB_SECRET``
(``mailer.unsub_token`` / ``verify_unsub_token``, constant-time compare, shipped in W1).
No token, a tampered token, or an unset secret — nothing happens and the caller is told
the link is not valid.

Two callers, one route
----------------------
1. **A human** on ``/unsubscribe.html?t=…`` presses the button; the page sends JSON.
2. **A mail client** doing RFC 8058 one-click POSTs ``List-Unsubscribe=One-Click`` as
   form data to the URL in the ``List-Unsubscribe`` header, with the token in the query
   string. Gmail and Yahoo require this of bulk senders.

So the token is read from the query string OR the JSON body, and a body that is not JSON
is not an error — it is case 2.

**Nothing mutates on GET.** Corporate mail scanners and link-preview bots fetch every URL
in an inbound message; a GET that unsubscribed would silently opt people out who never
touched the link. The page loads inert and the mutation is a POST the reader initiates.

Idempotent by construction
--------------------------
The suppression write is an upsert and the preference write is an upsert, so a second
click is a success that reports ``already: true`` — never an error, never a duplicate-key
500 shown to someone who just wants the mail to stop.

Resubscribe is a SEPARATE action, never the default, and it deliberately refuses to lift
a suppression whose reason is ``bounce`` or ``complaint``: those are not preferences the
reader gets to overrule from a link. A hard bounce means the address rejected us and a
complaint means someone pressed "spam" — sending again because a link was clicked is how
a domain's reputation dies. Only an ``unsubscribe`` (and an operator's ``manual``, from
the Email Center) is theirs to undo.

THE TOKEN IS SCOPED TO ONE ACTION
---------------------------------
The footer token authorises ``unsubscribe`` and nothing else: the action is inside the
MAC (``mailer._token_payload``), and the action is read from OUR JSON body only — never
from the query string, which is where a mail client's one-click POST cannot put it and
where an attacker could. Before that, ``?t=<any footer token>&action=resubscribe``
reversed someone's opt-out, and that token rides in every marketing footer and in the
``List-Unsubscribe`` header.

Undoing is therefore a capability the SERVER hands out, and only to the party that just
performed the opt-out in this very request: a successful, NEWLY-recorded unsubscribe
answers with a ``resubscribe_token`` the page keeps in a closure. Be precise about what
that buys — the token does not expire (it is the same HMAC construction), so the property
it has is that it is never DISTRIBUTED: it appears in one HTTP response, to the caller who
just opted out, and in no email, URL or DOM node. An already-suppressed address gets no
token at all, so replaying a stolen footer link cannot manufacture one, which is what
closes the escalation. An attacker who unsubscribes a not-yet-suppressed target can undo
their own action and reach the state they started from; they can never reverse a standing
choice somebody else made.
