## Failures (these block publish)

- radar: CONTENT FROZEN — as_of advanced 2026-10-03→2026-10-04 but signal values are byte-identical to the prior vintage (builder did not recompute)
- altdata: CONTENT FROZEN — as_of advanced 2026-10-03→2026-10-04 but signal values are byte-identical to the prior vintage (builder did not recompute)
- news: CONTENT FROZEN — as_of advanced 2026-10-03→2026-10-04 but signal values are byte-identical to the prior vintage (builder did not recompute)

_Invariants: coverage floor · score-column degeneracy · content-freeze (as_of advanced but values identical) · staleness · distribution drift. Ground-truth-free — see engine/signal_sanity.py._
