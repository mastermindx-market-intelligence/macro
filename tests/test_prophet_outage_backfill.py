"""tests/test_prophet_outage_backfill.py — the force-majeure 2026-08-09 replay.

DESIGN OF RECORD: research/PROPHET_OUTAGE_BACKFILL_2026_08.md (rev-1, 2026-08-11).
Operator order: replay the ONE receipted origination event the 2026-08-09 bake
refused on a mixed-vintage flag that #5241 later proved wrong. The standing
no-backfill law (research/PROPHET_LEDGER_SCHEMA.md) is not repealed — it is exempted
for exactly this event, and these tests are what keeps the exemption from widening.

WHAT EACH GROUP PINS

  INPUT IDENTITY (§0.2) — the blocker review found. The replay input must be the
  BAKE-TIME board, not a later re-render of the same ``as_of``: the 2026-08-10
  re-render swapped the ranker v1→v2, refreshed its options snapshot, and admitted
  three tickers through a wall-clock earnings-blackout hole. Four hard refusals are
  pinned here (sha256, as_of, ranker, ancestry), and the sha256 one is checked
  against the REAL contaminated board on main, not a fixture.

  THE HEAL IS RECOMPUTED, NOT ASSERTED (§0.2). Flipping ``mixed_vintage`` is only
  honest if the flag was wrong, so the tests drive the real ``_panel_price_reach``
  over a panel that reproduces the board's own receipt (six Sunday-dated members
  against a Friday majority) and pin both directions: a panel that clamps clean
  verifies, and a genuinely torn panel REFUSES.

  SEGREGATION THROUGH EVERY CONSUMER (§0.6) — the set of plans stamped
  ``origination_mode`` and the set enumerated in the disclosure must be the SAME set,
  both directions; and the stamp must survive into the index row, the FORWARD-LEDGER
  row at close, and the published record's split. Marketing surfaces must
  HARD-EXCLUDE, and the stage-shadow tilt cohort — the one block read back into live
  geometry — must exclude too.

  MUTATION CHECKS ARE TESTS, NOT NOTES (M9). The two segregation-critical mutations
  are executed in-process via monkeypatch: the suite proves the guard goes red when
  the guarded behaviour is removed, rather than asking a reader to trust a pasted
  terminal transcript.

NOTHING HERE WRITES THE REPO. Every executing test builds a throwaway git repo under
``tmp_path``. The real-tree census tests are read-only and skip when the checkout is
sparse (agent worktrees commonly omit ``site/`` and ``data/``); those are the ones
that run for real in CI, where the checkout is complete.
