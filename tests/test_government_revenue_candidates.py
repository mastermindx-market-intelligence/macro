    ``graph_known_at`` (measured 54/54 on the 2026-08-19 defense21
    republish), so an unaccounted row minted in the very same republish that
    produced the newest issued row sits exactly AT the frontier, not behind

    It was accidentally equal to *everything the source engine could see* while

    as the contract -- so it red on 2026-08-12T23:50:04Z, when fifteen forward
    candidates issued on seven award records the review never touched.

    Regenerating the manifest to cover them would have auto-issued fifteen
    unreviewed ``do_not_backfill`` decisions and stamped a ``reviewed_at`` no
    human reviewed, against rows that were never suppression-eligible: they were
    issued forward, which is the correct disposition and the one the nightly
    already took (``candidate_projection_status`` ``status: ok``).  So partition
    the rebuild the way the engine itself partitions it -- quarantined vs active
    -- and hold the reviewed cohort to identity equality on its own terms.

    ``observed_known_at`` is excluded from that equality: it tracks
    ``graph_known_at`` and would red on every legitimate republish, inviting a
    regen that stamps observation after the review act.  The engine already
    binds by :func:`historical_suppression_entry_key` (graph/clock-independent)
    and substitutes the reviewed entry's clock before comparing a current row.
    The clock is still asserted present and offset-aware on both sides.

    The gate the count was standing in for is restored explicitly below: every
    row the source engine currently sees must be accounted for in the append-only
    audit ledger.  A first-seen candidate that is neither issued nor reviewed
    still fails here, which is the protection the manifest's own limitations
    clause promises.

    A DIFFERENT guard already covers a DIFFERENT failure mode and survives
    independently of the row-level discriminator below: the manifest loader
    itself (``candidates.py:315-324``,
    ``load_candidate_issuance_correction_manifest``) requires every entry's
    ``observed_known_at`` to sit at or before its own declared
    ``predecessor.projection_generated_at``, refusing to admit an entry that
    claims to have been observed AFTER the predecessor projection it is
    supposedly correcting.  That is the surviving forward-retiming guard for
    anything that actually reaches the manifest in this receipt-present
    regime; it says nothing about an unaccounted row that never reached the
    manifest at all, which is exactly the gap the ``escaped`` check below
