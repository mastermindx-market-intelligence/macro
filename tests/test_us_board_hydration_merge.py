"""Hydration must MERGE the withheld board cards into the groups the shell drew.

THE BUG (reported on the live board 2026-08-20, reproduced against the shipped
site/us_stocks.html + site/premiumdata/us_stocks.json): the US Prophet board
showed "LIVE NOW · 13" twice — once over three cards, then again over ten
different ones — with "Setting up · 38" below both.

Neither side of the tier wall was wrong on its own. Both render from the same
partial (templates/_us_board_cards.html.j2) and each groups ITS OWN rows: the
shell heads the preview slice, the tier payload heads the locked remainder, and
both stamp the TRUE full-board count (build_site._us_board_group_items — that is
deliberate, so a gated shell's heading stays honest while only the preview shows
under it). The defect was purely in how the two were joined:
`grid.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', payload.cards_html)` appended the payload's
whole heading-bearing block after the shell's, so

  * every stage present on BOTH sides drew its heading twice, and
  * every withheld group landed after every shell group, so a preview that
    spanned two stages put the withheld "Live now" BELOW "Setting up".

These tests run the SHIPPED merge — sliced out of the rendered page, not
reimplemented — against a stub DOM (tests/us_board_hydrate_harness.js), plus the
markup-contract pins that keep the join key alive on both sides of the wall.

JINJA2-ONLY, deliberately (same discipline as tests/test_us_board_gate.py's own
"import-light where possible" note). Nothing here imports scripts.build_site: the
merge block it slices carries no Jinja and no gate-derived value, so a hand-built
`gate` dict renders the identical bytes, and pulling build_site in would drag
pandas/plotly — and, in a curated `scope: exclusive` CI job, build_site's whole
engine import closure — behind a suite that only needs a template render. If the
gate contract ever moves out from under `_gate()` below, `_merge_source` fails
LOUDLY on the missing block rather than passing over a shell that never rendered
the hydrate script.
