"""Voice doctrine v5 — the census-by-content ratchet (2026-08-11).

WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR. The v4 register was not a drift, it was COMMANDED: the
system prompt ordered "Mix 'I' and 'we'... Give a stance: watching, leaning,
respecting, fading", `CORPUS_EXEMPLARS` fed first-person lines, the persona
cards registered "mixes 'I' for the read", and `validate_copy` REQUIRED a
theme_list body to end on "?". Measured on the 679-item shipped corpus
(2026-08-11): first person in 175 items (25.8%), "so far today" in 79, and
"Watching, no position." / "Levels, not advice." dominating the 72 items that
end on a short closer. Across 205 posts from 12 real reference accounts,
rhetorical-question hooks, topic hashtags and exclamation emphasis appear zero
times. Doctrine: docs/marketing_voice_doctrine_v5.md.

WHY A CENSUS BY CONTENT rather than a grep over filenames. The register lives in
DATA — template banks, exemplar tuples, persona `example_lines` in YAML — and a
new bank is one dict away. This suite IMPORTS those objects and walks their
values, so a lane that adds a seventh voice, an eighth persona or a new kind is
covered the night it is written, with no test edit. That is the house rule
(memory: census-by-content-not-by-filename) and it is the only mechanism that
stops v4 re-entering through a bank nobody thought to grep.

Deps: stdlib + pytest + pyyaml. No pandas, no numpy.

# 4. The number budget must not tax the doctrine it enforces (2026-08-11)
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# THE LIVE LOSS. On 2026-08-11 the voice screen quarantined 26 items while 22
# posts published, and the press-wire hot poll kept refilling the queue during a
# hot tape, so seven consecutive post-now dispatch runs (14:42Z-15:15Z) ended
# "NOTHING POSTED". Two independent defects in `number_soup_violations`, both
# pinned below:
#
#   1. A month-day DATE counted as a figure. The counter already stripped
#      cashtags, list enumerators and YEARS, but "set on August 5" contributed
#      an 5 and "on August 11" an 11 — while v5 REQUIRES the dated precedent
#      ("first time since", prior record + when it was set). The gate was
#      taxing the exact form the doctrine commands.
#   2. `breaking` sat on the default budget of 2 while it is 65% of recent
#      supply (258 of the last 400 items) and its contract is four figures by
#      construction: print, delta, prior/reference level, gap.
#
# These are REGRESSION pins for the two items below, quoted verbatim from
# data/marketing/outbox/status_ledger.jsonl. Neither half is allowed to widen
# further: the dump and default-budget cases below are the other side of it.
