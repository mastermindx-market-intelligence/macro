"""tests/test_theme_hash_deeplink.py
====================================
Guards the ``#theme-<id>`` deep-link contract, US receiving side + emitters.

The alerts board (engine/alert_triage.py SOURCES joins ``page`` + each event's
``anchor``) and engine/theme_alerts.py emit ``#theme-<id>`` deep links; alert
rows live ~90 days and bookmarks longer. The emitting engines are covered by
tests/test_sector_pulse_wiring.py and tests/test_theme_alerts.py; this file
covers the *receiving* side, which regressed silently twice:

* The 2026-07 revamp (#3282) removed the US page's ``#theme-<id>`` elements but
  left the boot handler calling ``openTheme()``, which returned early — every
  inbound link landed and silently did nothing, for months. #4254 fixed it with
  ``resolveThemeHash()``: validate the id, then ``location.replace()`` to
  ``basket/<id>.html``.
* The Sector Intelligence consolidation (#4237) turned baskets.html.j2 into a
  redirect stub whose hard-coded ``location.replace("…#actnow-section")`` ATE
  inbound hashes, and its merged-page handler hopped through an unguarded
  ``location.href`` — the same silent failure plus a Back-trap and a 404 path
  for retired ids. This suite was in no CI pack, so main stayed green.

The contract now has three US pieces, and all must hold:
  * the baskets.html stub FORWARDS ``#theme-<id>`` hashes to the merged page
    (non-theme traffic keeps the designed #actnow-section landing, which
    tests/test_sector_intelligence_page.py pins);
  * sector_central.html resolves the hash by navigating to ``basket/<id>.html``
    — it renders no ``#theme-<id>`` elements, so scrolling is not an option;
  * the alerts board emits theme links against the merged page directly, not
    the stub.
The china/hk/canada/intl pages still render ``.tcard`` elements with
``id="theme-<id>"`` and must keep routing through the shared ``openTheme()`` —
so nobody "cleans up" the shared function on the strength of the US pages no
longer calling it.
