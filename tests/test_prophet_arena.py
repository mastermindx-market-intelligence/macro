series, and temporary roots.  No committed artifact is pinned (a test that asserts on
tonight's board grades the tape, not the code) and no fixture is anchored to the wall

    """21 buy rows engineered so every policy resolves to a DIFFERENT, exact set.

    Admission is the STATUS CLASS (ANTICIPATION A1, 2026-08-08): an entry status in
    ``{bounce_wait, wait_pullback, hold, buy_now, partial}``, a tone in ``{up,
    caution}``, and ``band != 'low'``.  It was ``act_level >= 2 AND band != 'low'``
    before that, which is why several rows below carry an act_level that no longer
    gates anything (it still drives C1's ORDERING leg, which is untouched).

      A01..A14  admitted; scores 90 down to 25 in steps of 5; act_level alternates
                3, 2, 3, 2, ... so C1's "act_level==2 first" re-order is unambiguous.
      X03       admitted, lowest score (10) — C0 retains it; capped challengers cut it.
      R01       stage 'ran', status 'hold' — ANTICIPATION A1 (2026-08-08) admits it
                into the champion pool on its status; it used to sit outside on
                act_level 1.  Left as-is deliberately: a stage-ran patience row
                entering on its own is exactly what A1 was built to do.
      R02..R03  stage 'ran', statuses the class refuses ('extended' / 'topping');
                R03 is also band 'low'.  The champion cannot admit them, and neither
                can C7 — its probe relaxes the status leg for `buy_soon` ONLY.
      X01       band 'low' with the highest score of all — a hard exclusion no
                policy may ever reach.
      X02       status 'buy_soon', band high — refused by the champion's STATUS CLASS
                (A1) and the ONE row C7's admission probe is allowed to rescue.  It
                was act_level 1 before A1 and excluded by the act gate; the row keeps
                act_level 1 so C1's ordering leg is unaffected.
      X04       status 'buy_soon' AND band 'low' — C7's widening must NOT rescue it,
                because the band leg still runs inside the probe.  Score 93 is chosen
                so a wrong admission would visibly reorder the top of the book: it
                would land above X02 (92) and A01 (90) rather than hide in the tail.
