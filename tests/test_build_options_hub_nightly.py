"""tests/test_build_options_hub_nightly.py — scripts/build_options_hub_nightly.py.

OEU bug-wave finding: the published options_hub/gex/{ROOT}.json carries a
headline `asof` and a self-consistent `coverage` block (both computed live from
the greeks/OI read for that session), but its `history` tail comes from a
SEPARATELY-CADENCED store (data/polygon_gex/summary_{ROOT}.parquet) that can lag
behind by one or more sessions with nothing in the payload disclosing the gap —
a reader sees one "asof" and a stale history tail contradicting it.

_attach_gex_history is the one place `history` is joined onto the live gex
payload (scripts/build_options_hub_nightly.build_root, CONTRACT v2). This
suite pins:
  - history is still OMITTED (not set to null) when the store is absent —
    CONTRACT v2's own frontend-checks-key-presence rule, unchanged.
  - when history IS attached, coverage now carries `history_asof` — the tail's
    own last date — so asof vs coverage.asof vs coverage.history_asof can be
    reconciled by a reader instead of silently disagreeing.
