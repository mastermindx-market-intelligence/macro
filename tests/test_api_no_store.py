"""Regression test — every /api/* response must forbid shared caching.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-07-25 Stripe go-live audit, found live in the sandbox):
macro-api sent NO Cache-Control header on /api/* at all. The EdgeOne edge therefore
applied its own default heuristic and cached **404** responses — with a cache key that
IGNORES the Authorization header. `GET /api/billing/portal` returns 404 for any user
without a Stripe customer (every free user), so that 404 got parked at the edge and
replayed to PAYING subscribers: they saw "no billing account yet" and could not open the
billing portal at all — the only self-serve path to update a card, cancel, or downgrade.
Reproduced twice against production with `eo-cache-status: HIT`.

The fix is app.main._api_no_store. These tests pin the three properties that matter, so
the bug cannot come back silently if the middleware is reordered or dropped:

  1. a 404 on /api/* carries no-store          <- the exact response that was cached
  2. a 401 on /api/* carries no-store          <- the other auth-shaped failure
  3. a 200 on /api/* carries no-store          <- per-user payloads (/api/me et al)
  4. a route that sets its own Cache-Control keeps it (setdefault, not clobber)
  5. non-/api paths are left alone (the static site WANTS to be edge-cached)

Offline: no network, no Stripe, no Supabase — TestClient against the mounted app.
