"""Bitemporal materialization of the theme graph (masterplan §4.1, directive §2C).

WHAT THESE PROTECT — the honesty invariants, which are all invisible at runtime:

* A backfill is RECONSTRUCTION. Every row says so, and its belief_time is the run's own
  date, so the graph never claims to have known a membership when it took effect.
* ``date_provenance`` separates a real dated changelog entry from the seed CONSTANT a
  membership document uses for its first-run members. That constant is where a series
  begins, not when a company joined a theme, and stamping it ``curated_changelog`` would
  be exactly the "make present knowledge look historically known" failure G0.2 forbids.
* Corroborating evidence is ADDED, never merged: a member the raw vendor dump also shows
  gets a second receipt beside the membership document's, and nothing nets.
* The store is append-only. A removal appends a NEW row carrying valid_to; the row that
  opened the interval survives, and the closed edge keeps resolving.
* A THS concept code the vendor has since renamed is reported, not fatal.

Fixture-only: every input is built under tmp_path, the identity-break table is stubbed
empty, and nothing here reads live ``data/`` or pins a live count.
