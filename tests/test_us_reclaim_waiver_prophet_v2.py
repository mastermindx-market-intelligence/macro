"""The RATIFIED counter-trend reclaim waiver — Arm P, `us_prophet_v2`.

WHAT THIS PINS.  `engine.signal_quality` now waives ONE leg of the buy filter — the 2-bar
200-day RECLAIM required of a name that is both below its 200-day average and weekly-down —
for a US name whose basket peers are themselves washed out at the ratified notch.  Authority:
`research/RECLAIM_VETO_CONDITIONAL_PREREG.md` (family `reclaim_veto_conditional_v1`) §4 Arm P,
adjudicated and ratified §5 on 2026-08-10, notch moved to 20% family-wide by the operator in
the same log; the era fence `us_prophet_v1 -> us_prophet_v2` was pre-specified by
`research/prophet_us_audit/RECLAIM_VETO_PACKET_2026-08-05.md` §7.  It is the ONE revival path
§9 left open for this leg, so `DNR:KILL-200DMA-RECLAIM-VETO-FLAT` is complied with, not
worked around: a flat drop stays killed.

THE BOUNDARY IS THE POINT.  Only the PURE reclaim failure — the hold leg PASSED, the reclaim
leg refused — may convert.  `CT_HOLD_FAIL` and `CT_BOTH_FAIL` are byte-identical to v1 under
every state, because §5 named that boundary explicitly when it ruled the motivating exemplar
HL 2026-06-16 out of reach ("the basket state admits it but this construction cannot" — a
hold-leg relaxation is a different construction owing its own prereg).  Half of the tests
below exist to make widening that branch fail loudly.

HERMETIC BY CONSTRUCTION.  Every case writes its own artifact to `tmp_path` and points the
loader at it.  Reading the COMMITTED `site/factordata/basket_washout_state.json` would be a
scheduled red: the waiver's PIT window is five sessions wide around a stamp that moves every
night, so a test riding the live artifact passes this week and fails next week for a reason
that has nothing to do with the code.

Siblings: `tests/test_us_reclaim_veto_packet.py` (the frozen v1 isolation the study measured
against — it must keep passing UNCHANGED, and does, because the waiver defaults to absent at
`_buy_filter`), `tests/test_hk_reclaim_veto_policy.py` (the flag HK drops flat).
