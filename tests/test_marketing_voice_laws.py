"""The operator's graded batch, encoded (2026-07-30).

On 2026-07-30 the operator read a full batch of LLM-written posts and graded it
**F**, quoting the defects back one at a time. This file is that review turned
into assertions: every string below is either a post they APPROVED (must stay
shippable forever) or one they REJECTED (must never ship again), in their words.

The axis the batch separates on is not tone, length, or accuracy. It is whether
the reaction COSTS the writer something:

    APPROVED  "Hershey's closed green eight days in a row. No corroborated
               driver on the tape for it yet."                 (refuses to fake insight)
    REJECTED  "EQT is back at the price where buyers kept showing up... that's
               the whole observation, no target, no thesis."   (thoughtfulness at no cost)

VOICE DOCTRINE v5 (2026-08-11) kept that axis and moved the SUBJECT. The
approved posts above were written in the first person; the reaction that costs
something is now stated about the market, the level or the streak, never about
the author. `cw.voice_v5_violations` is in this file's battery, so a fixture
that drifts back to the narrator turns this suite red rather than certifying it.
See docs/marketing_voice_doctrine_v5.md.

Two of these guards replaced a MANDATE. Signal posts used to be REQUIRED to
carry an invalidation phrase and an honesty caveat; stacking both into 275 chars
alongside a level and a stance produces "37.1 is my trigger, 30.9 proves me
wrong. One pattern isn't a guarantee" by construction. The house voice was not
drifting toward the machine register — the config was ordering it. See
``config/marketing.yml`` copy_laws and memory ``marketing-voice-fact-plus-cost``.

The enumerable half of this class lives here. The open-ended half ("is this
post actually interesting?") belongs to the batch auditor in
``engine/marketing/copy_auditor.py`` — a ban list cannot reach it and should not
try.
