"""tests/test_prophet_earnings_split_brain.py — R0-C: the legacy earnings arm is fenced.

WHAT THIS FILE PINS (earnings/company-event suite Wave 0, ticket R0-C).

Prophet had two earnings paths. The governed one — ``_load_earnings_evidence_context``
/ ``_earnings_plan_annotation`` — runs strictly after ``select_candidates`` and is
hard-fenced to annotation. The other was a split-brain: ``engine/prophet_bridge.py``
and ``engine/prophet_stage_shadow.py``, both PRODUCTION modules on the nightly lane,
imported ``engine/prophet_stage_fusion.py`` — a RESEARCH BACKTEST HARNESS — to reach a
handful of point-in-time primitives, and through it read a legacy earnings parquet.

Two properties are pinned here.

1. SEVERANCE. No production module imports the research harness. The shared
   primitives live in ``engine/prophet_stage_inputs.py``; the harness re-exports them,
   so published PSF/PSQ results stay reproducible against identical code.

2. BLAST RADIUS. The legacy earnings source cannot reach candidate identity, order,
   rank, size, gate, geometry, options, or tranches. Its ONLY lawful channel is the
   provisionally-promoted hold-horizon leash (PSQ-H1, 2026-07-20), and that channel is
   pinned to its ratified numbers — 45 base, 56 tilted, nothing else.

WHY A THIRD PROPERTY IS DISCLOSURE, NOT INVARIANCE. The legacy parquet
(``data/stage_analysis/backfill/earnings_calls.parquet``) is gitignored, was never
committed, and has no fetch/publish pair, so it is ABSENT on every CI and deploy host.
The leash's earnings arm therefore never fires in production: the tilt has been inert
since it shipped. That is not repaired by deleting the leash (a promoted authority
needs an operator ruling) nor by re-pointing the join at a different, differently-scaled
artifact (that would silently re-scale a promoted construction). What IS repaired is
that the starvation used to be invisible — "no positive earnings call" and "no
earnings-call data at all" produced identical output. They are now distinguishable in
the plan block and in the forward shadow that arms the leash's auto-demote clause.
