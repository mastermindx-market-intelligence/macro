"""The agent worktree-root list is duplicated in four places; pin them in step.

A repository serving several agent fleets accumulates one checkout root per fleet.
Each root has to be declared three times, and each declaration does a different job:

* ``.gitignore`` — keeps the root out of every session's ``git status``.
* ``config/worktree_gc.json`` ``roots`` — makes the root DELETABLE by the GC, and
  walkable by ``scan_orphans``. Registered worktrees are classified from
  ``git worktree list`` either way, so a missing root does not dent the report —
  it fails later and quietly, at the belt in ``apply_deletions`` that refuses any
  target ``outside configured roots``.
* ``ship_loop_guard.AGENT_WORKTREE_ROOTS`` — excludes another fleet's churn from
  this session's dirty gate.
* ``worktree_create_sparse.SESSION_WORKTREE_ROOTS`` (added 2026-08-20) — the roots
  the WorktreeCreate hook climbs OUT of when choosing where to plant, so a spawn
  from inside a session tree makes a sibling instead of a nested child. A root
  missing here nests silently: the child is then invisible to the GC's depth-1
  orphan scan and is dragged along when its parent is swept.

Drift is silent and each miss fails differently, which is why it went unnoticed
twice. Measured 2026-08-11: ``.codex/worktrees/`` was declared in NONE of the three
while holding 55 live checkouts, so it surfaced as untracked dirt in every session,
could be classified SAFE by the GC and then refused at deletion, and false-blocked a
session at Stop over a Codex tree it could neither commit nor delete. ``.claire/worktrees/``
was in the guard and the GC but not ``.gitignore``.

Home-dir roots (``~/...``) are deliberately out of scope: they are outside the
repository, so neither ``.gitignore`` nor the ship-loop guard can see them.
