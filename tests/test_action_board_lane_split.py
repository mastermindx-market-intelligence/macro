"""CN/CA/HK action-board lane split — ports the #1513 US (urgency, tag) routing to
scripts/build_china._china_action_board, scripts/build_canada._action_board and
scripts/build_hk._action_board (the "what to act on now" board on each stock page).

Pins (mirrors tests/test_basket_integration.py::test_action_board_caution_tag_routing):
  * caution + "DON'T CHASE"             → on_the_run   (extended uptrend — never take_profits)
  * caution + "UNCONFIRMED — HIGH RISK" → avoid        (bear-trend countertrend bounce)
  * caution + anything else (incl. "TAKE PROFITS") → take_profits; exit → take_profits
  * tag literals match engine/cycles.py entry_timing BYTE-for-byte (em dash U+2014 in
    UNCONFIRMED, ASCII apostrophe in DON'T — a curly-quote drift silently unroutes a lane)
  * both standalone templates render the new lane and stay missing-key-safe on the
    pre-split actions shape (no on_the_run key).

NOTE: The US action_board (scripts/build_site.py) uses lane_hint-first routing with a
conservative unknown→hold default (not take_profits) per the 2026-07-10 us_stocks
scorecard adjudication. CN/CA/HK boards retain the pre-adjudication take_profits
default — their tests below reflect that.
