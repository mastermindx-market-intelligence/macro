"""Regression tests for the 2026-07-29 adversarial audit of the macro.html Risk Radar.

One test (or small cluster) per audited defect.  Every fix here is a BUG / HONESTY fix — no
gate value, threshold, weight, band cut or calibration constant moves, and several tests assert
that invariance directly.

Index of what is pinned:
  1  market_state._flip_text ......... impossible flip claims (both directions unreachable)
  2  market_state ceiling vs blend .... score_source / capped / score_gap + disarmed amplifiers
  3  conditions + market_state ........ NFCI silent-neutral, drawdown composition, vintages
  4  risk_radar.build_nh_contraction .. structurally-inapplicable leg diluted the sub-score
  5  risk_radar.subscore_series ....... display_only leg set the displayed number
  6  risk_radar calibration honesty ... flat "~1.5-2x lift" claim vs a state measuring 0.90x
  7  risk_radar_audit ................. context-gate counterfactual was unfalsifiable
  9  the minor cluster ................ 9a copy, 9b rounding, 9c bounds, 9d PIT gate, 9h replica
