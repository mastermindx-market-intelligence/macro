"""tests/test_marketing_relay_hygiene.py — THE SOURCE'S PAGE IS NOT OUR POST.

Fixture-driven; ZERO live network, ZERO live LLM.

THE LIVE POSTS. ForexLive/InvestingLive was armed as a `tier: wire` RSS feed on
2026-08-03 (#4352). In its first ~30 hours it produced FOUR outbox items and
THREE carried a defect — every one of them the source's own page conventions
relayed verbatim:

  1. ob-2026-08-04-5b059eea4a  (posted to @mastermindx001)
     "More info on this - South Korea core inflation hits 2-1/2 year high
      despite headline cooling -- wire reports"
     A DANGLING REFERENCE. "More info on this -" is their headline prefix for a
     follow-up to their own earlier post; off their site "this" points nowhere.

  2. ob-2026-08-03-7d40131982
     "investingLive Americas FX news wrap 31 Jul; It's a wrap for the month of
      July -- wire reports"
     THE PUBLISHER'S BRAND in our body. The de-handling law screens "@handles",
     so a bare brand walked through — and the configured display name is
     "ForexLive" while the site now writes "investingLive", so even a
     display-name check would have missed it.

  3. ob-2026-08-03-fffec5dc90
     "China private survey July manufacturing PMI 50.9 (expected 51.5, prior
      51.7)" + "On the wires: I'll have more to come on this separately,
      details etc."
     THEIR AUTHOR'S FIRST PERSON as our line 2, promising a follow-up we were
     never going to write — and it passed the restatement gate as ADDITIVE,
     because that gate counts lexically novel tokens and filler is novel.

WHAT IS PINNED, and the mutation each pin is armed against:
  1. The pointer is SCRUBBED, not dropped — the story survives, and the
     publisher's original headline survives as `headline_source`.
  2. A scrub may never empty a headline or leave a fragment.
  3. Prose that merely CONTAINS a marker word ("more information reaches the
     market slowly") is untouched — the separator is what makes it a pointer.
  4. Furniture DROPS: calendars, house wraps, "what are the main events".
  5. A DATE is not a market reading — the escape that rescues "Markets wrap:
     S&P closes -1.8%" must not rescue "...wrap 3 Aug".
  6. The brand check reads the URL HOST, so a rebrand needs no config edit.
  7. First person and page-artifact references are caught in headline AND body.
  8. The deterministic lead scan skips a first sentence that does not fit
     instead of discarding the whole paragraph — and never truncates one.
  9. restatement_verdict calls filler what it is.
 10. End-to-end: the exact live post text cannot be reconstructed.
