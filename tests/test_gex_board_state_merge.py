"""scripts/build_gex_board.py — the OIP W1 site/gex/<T>.json enrichment.

engine/gex_state.compute_gex_state()'s three additive fields (oi_delta_clusters,
wall_persistence, net_gex_pctile, PR #3976) are computed by
_compute_and_write_gex_state() and written to a SEPARATE file,
site/options_structure/gex_state/<KEY>.json — but W1_DESIGN_SPEC.md's own
template code reads them as `gx.wall_persistence` / `gx.oi_delta_clusters`,
`gx` being site/gex.js's name for site/gex/<T>.json, the payload Ticker mode
and gex.html actually fetch. Without folding the fields into THAT payload too,
every wall-check chip and "Where positions built" panel would read undefined
forever, regardless of a name's real coverage. This suite pins the fold.
