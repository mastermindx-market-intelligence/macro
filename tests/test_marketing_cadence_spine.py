"""tests/test_marketing_cadence_spine.py — XG-W2 cadence + collision spine.

The four gates this wave has to hold, and the sections that hold them:

  1. The resolver REPLACES the decorative per-account behaviour — a spec's
     posts_per_day / min_spacing_min genuinely bounds emission (§1 unit, §2
     through the live publisher on a fixture clock).
  2. The `session` schema field validates and Cici's committed spec exercises
     it (§3).
  3. Two accounts drawing the same story produce exactly ONE emission (§4).
  4. Cross-account near-dup rejects a candidate near-identical to ANOTHER
     account's recent post (§5).
  5. press_lane + fastlane emit through make_item/validate_item — no
     hand-rolled writer remains (§6, including a source-text grep).

Plus §7 (wire routing is config, not code) and §8 (jitter determinism).

CONVENTIONS. tmp_path for all I/O, an injected `now` everywhere (no wall clock
in any assertion path), zero network. Import closure is stdlib + pyyaml so the
suite runs in full in the marketing-engine lane — nothing here is
importorskip-gated, so it can never decay into a skip-only suite.
