"""China SI Workspace shell invariants — sibling of tests/test_si_workspace_shell.py.

sector_central_china.html.j2 and templates/si_workspace_china.js are a deliberate
SECOND copy of the US workspace, not a shared module: the two pages differ in view
count (China has no Money & Breadth organ), asset manifest, anchor table and read
composers, and the US router's tables are pinned line-by-line next door. Two small
files with a guard each beats one file with four conditionals — but a fork with no
guard drifts, so this file pins the China half.

What it defends, and why each pin exists rather than being obvious:

* **Router table.** The organs kept their section ids specifically so the router can
  reach them. A legacy id dropped from LEGACY_ANCHORS does not 404 — the deep link
  silently lands on Overview, a failure with no symptom except a user who never finds
  that panel again. Both halves are checked: the row exists AND the element it names
  is really inside the view it routes to.
* **Lazy mounting.** sector_cycles.js and subsector_rotation.js size themselves from a
  container's clientWidth. Loaded eagerly they measure 0 inside a display:none view and
  bake a blank chart for the whole session, so each must be injected by the router
  after its view is on screen — and must NOT also be loaded by a plain <script src>.
* **The board's cycle dependency.** The Overview conviction cards draw mini
  cycle-position sparklines from window.SECTOR_CYCLES, so '@cycles' has to be on the
  overview lazy list too. Drop it and 31 cards ship with an empty 66px slot each until
  the reader happens to open The Map.
