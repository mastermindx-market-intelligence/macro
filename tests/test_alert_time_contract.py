"""Alert Command Center TIME CONTRACT + evidence routing (Wave 7, PR A).

The Alert Center is a triage layer: its ranking, its "today / 1d ago" wording, its
recency points and its catalyst countdown decide what a PM looks at FIRST.  Two defects
made those lie, and these tests pin the repair so neither can come back:

  D1  ``engine.subsector_rotation_alerts`` stamped events with the rotation payload's
      ``generated_utc`` (when our builder ran) instead of its ``asof`` (the settled
      session the read is about) — so Aug-19 conclusions displayed as "Aug-20 · today".
  D2  the board's own "today" was UTC midnight and every aware timestamp was run through
      ``tz_localize(None)``.  Between 00:00Z and ~05:00Z — a window the nightly pipeline
      runs straight through — a US cross-asset desk rolled its day over while New York
      was still in the previous afternoon, and source timezones were destroyed on read.

  D6  emergence alerts carry a precise ``#ne-<signature>`` anchor but were routed at
      ``baskets.html``, a redirect stub that forwards only ``#theme-*`` and dumps every
      other hash on ``sector_central.html#actnow-section`` — so "Open →" landed on a
      generic page section instead of the exact evidence card.

Every clock here is INJECTED.  No test in this file reads a wall clock.
