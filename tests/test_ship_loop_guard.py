    session syncs to tip first — `git reset --hard origin/main` — to check the fix
    where it actually landed, so HEAD moves with zero session-created commits and
    the old check missed it. The chain it was then held to is unsatisfiable:
    GitHub refuses a zero-diff pull request ("No commits between main and
    <branch>") and `unmerged` is not an escapable external blocker, so the only
    exit observed in the field (2026-07-26, claude/serene-colden-e5b716) was
    resetting back to start_head. Nothing shipped here, so nothing is asked of
    GitHub either — the stubs below fail the test if it is consulted at all.
