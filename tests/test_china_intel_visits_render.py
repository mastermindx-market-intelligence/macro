"""Render tests for the K2c Institutional Visits block in china_intel.html.j2
(P1, China Alpha Intelligence, PR #6050 — SOL acceptance-review repair).

Renders the REAL template through the SAME Jinja environment the production
builder uses (scripts/build_china_intel.py's `_env()` — imported, not
hand-rolled): same loader, same autoescape flag, same i18n globals. A
hand-rolled Environment could silently diverge (wrong autoescape, missing
`t`/`td`/`tr` globals) and pass while the real page fails, or the reverse.

Covers every state the block can actually render (masterplan §9.3 ten-state
taxonomy, the six reachable at this build stage): ok, measured_no_event,
no_coverage, stale, source_failure, not_applicable. Also asserts:
  - unresolved / not_yet_available visitor identity renders the honest unknown
    line, never disappears, never a bare zero
  - a resolved visitor identity DOES render its name (the "when actually
    resolved" branch)
  - "first seen since coverage start" wording appears; "first ever" never does
  - no directional hue class (rs-pos/rs-neg/stage-*) is emitted BY the visits
    block itself (those classes exist elsewhere in the page for unrelated
    desks — this suite scopes its negative assertion to the disc-card markup
    the visits block actually emits)
  - no translated text lands in a bare title= attribute (house CI i18n guard)

This suite is wired into the china_intel_hub owner lane in
.github/ci/legacy-jobs.yml (unrun-brain-desks) alongside test_china_intel_hub_visits.py.
