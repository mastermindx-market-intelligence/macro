"""Render smoke tests for templates/dashboard.html.j2 (macro.html + us_stocks.html).

Why this exists: the template is rendered ONLY by scripts/build_site.py's nightly
build — no test rendered it, so template-level Jinja errors (undefined filters,
missing-key crashes per the `{% if d.key is not none %}` gotcha) reached the
nightly uncaught.  Concrete incident: PR #1784's original commit shipped
`{{ _nbr | map('extract', _NBR_EN) }}` — 'extract' is not a Jinja2 filter — and
the full suite stayed green; the crash would have surfaced as a dead
us_stocks.html render.  This suite reproduces build_site.py's exact environment
and render calls against a small synthetic view-model so that class of bug fails
here first.

The environment mirrors scripts/build_site.py: FileSystemLoader on templates/,
filters['min'], and globals td / tr (engine.i18n) + zip.  The template is
rendered twice with the same vm — mode='macro' (macro.html) and mode='stocks'
(us_stocks.html) — exactly like the build.

The standout-board fixture row carries a `dossier` dict (action / why_now /
no_buy_reasons / stale_flags / authority_level) matching the Buy Decision Packet
producer shape (PR #1784, build_stock_library join) — a non-empty
`no_buy_reasons` list is what caught the 'extract' filter crash.  Do not trim
these keys.  NOTE (PR #3012, 2026-07-19): the dossier/details markup is now
gated `mode != 'stocks'` while the board itself is `mode != 'macro'`, so the
dossier renders in NEITHER mode — the fixture now proves intentional absence
(see test_stocks_mode_dossier_block_intentionally_absent) instead of reaching
the markup.

# panel without x-scroll: at ≤680px the tertiary columns are hidden, keyed by
# per-column c-* classes.  The contract has two halves:
#   1. every <th> in BOTH strip tables carries a c-* class — a classless column
#      would silently sit outside the mobile budget and re-widen the table;
#   2. each class is either in the mobile KEEP set (identity, edge, stance) or
#      named in the 680px hide rule.
# Adding a column therefore forces an explicit mobile decision here.
# The G0.5a theme column only renders when a row stamps a theme, so the fixture
# stamps one to bring it under contract; its decision: context, not stance → hidden.
