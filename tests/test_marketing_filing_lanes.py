"""Fact-locked filing lanes — congress, insider, house picks (XG-E2).

Covers `engine/marketing/congress_feed.py`, `engine/marketing/insider_feed.py`
and `engine/marketing/house_picks.py`, plus their registration into the planned-
kind machinery (`outbox.KINDS`, `content_studio.PLANNED_KINDS`,
`expression_dial.PROFILES`).

WHAT THESE LANES CAN GET WRONG, which is what the file is organised around:

1. **Publishing a stale trade as news.** A congressional disclosure can be six
   weeks behind the trade and the site's own writing says so. §3 proves the lag
   sentence is present AND writer-visible, and that a packet which loses it
   REFUSES rather than shipping quietly.
2. **Ranking on the dollar headline.** The codex measured a $6.92M purchase
   reading as more important than a $299K one that multiplied its holder's stake
   twelve-fold. §2 is the mechanism table, including that exact RBKB case.
3. **Calling compensation a purchase.** §4 pins the open-market-only filter and
   the dividend-reinvestment exclusion.
4. **Printing an internal score as prose.** §6 proves the display-tier phrases
   carry no digit and that the guard raises when one appears.
5. **Re-posting a name a desk covered yesterday.** §5 is the LKFN-class
   interplay through the real outbox ledger.
6. **Laundering a screen into a call.** §7 proves every house pick names its
   desk in plain words and carries that desk's own disclosure.

LANE PURITY. The pure-logic tests import nothing beyond the engine modules and
stdlib, so they run in the thin marketing CI pack (`pytest pyyaml jinja2`). Only
the parquet-fixture tests need pandas, and they gate on it INSIDE the test body
(the sibling pattern in tests/test_marketing_card_parity.py) so the arithmetic,
lag and register guarantees keep their teeth in a pandas-less pack rather than
the whole module skipping.
