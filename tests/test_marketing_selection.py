"""tests/test_marketing_selection.py — Content Studio W1 selection layer (Builder B).

Every test here is keyed to a §0 acceptance gate of
`research/MARKETING_CONTENT_STUDIO_LLM_FIRST_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md` (operator
directive 2026-07-29, after the 65-post outbox batch was aborted at D1-S15), and
to the B-list of `research/marketing_dockets/CONTENT_STUDIO_W1_BUILD_CONTRACT.md`:

  * cooldown            — LKFN posted yesterday is ineligible today (gate 3c);
                          a |move| >= 4% re-opens it, with the reason threaded
  * reuse budget        — ARES on a 3rd account is refused, and a 2nd SIGNAL
                          account is refused (gate 3b)
  * degenerate stat     — "231 of 231" carries no information and is dropped
                          (gate 3h)
  * shape mixer         — corpus quotas, deterministic, no RNG (gate 4)
  * emit refusal        — a planned-kind item with no model copy does not queue
                          while copywriter.llm.required is on (gate 1)
  * expiry              — a planned item 36h past its slot is quarantined
  * auto-approve scope  — a planned kind waits for the operator; a publish-time
                          mover still clears (masterplan §7)

LANE PURITY. Nothing here imports `anthropic`, opens a socket, or reaches the
network: the writer is a stub injected by monkeypatching
`copywriter.write_posts_llm_v2`, and every ledger read/write happens under
tmp_path. The marketing-engine CI lane installs pytest + pyyaml and nothing
else, which is exactly the environment this file must pass in.
