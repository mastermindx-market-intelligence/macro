"""tests/test_support_page.py — /support.html (SEE W2 public support desk).

The page is a PINNED design (mockups/support_email/PIN.md + support_page.html), so this
suite guards the properties a later edit could quietly break without anything else going
red — the ones that are invisible in a screenshot:

  * the API contract: the form POSTs the exact seven fields app/support.py validates, to
    the exact route it serves;
  * the abuse hardening: the honeypot exists, is off-screen, unfocusable and un-autofilled
    — and is NOT merely `display:none`, which some bots and some password managers skip;
  * t0 is stamped at render, or the API's time-to-fill gate has nothing to measure;
  * bilingual dual-spans for every user-visible string, and NO translated text in a
    `title=` attribute (l-en/l-zh cannot operate inside an attribute);
  * PIN §1.1, as an executable assert: success/error use --ok/--act and NEVER --up/--down,
    because theme.css swaps those two under html[data-lang="zh"] for the Asia red-up
    convention — a success panel painted with --up turns RED for every Chinese reader.
