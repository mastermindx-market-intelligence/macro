"""Tests for engine/us_candidate_lanes.py — the US candidate-pool lane partition.

Five things are pinned here, in order of how badly a regression would hurt:

1. **NO AUTHORITY LEAK.**  This is a display-tier block over a scored board.  If any
   admission-path module ever learns to read it, the board's membership starts depending
   on a lower tier that was built precisely because it has no say.  ``TestNoAuthorityLeak``
   pins that three ways — a static token sweep over every module tree, an import-closure
   walk from the three authority modules, and a BEHAVIOURAL invariance check that
   ``prophet_bridge.select_candidates`` returns the same list with and without the block.
2. **buy[] IS UNTOUCHED.**  Membership, order and the row objects themselves.
   ``TestBuyLaneUntouched`` deep-compares against a pre-change snapshot; the mutation
   check for it is recorded in the PR body.
3. **THE PARTITION IS LOSSLESS** — ``sum(lane_counts) == len(rows) == eligible``, every
   eligible name exactly once, every off-board name with a non-empty reason.  This is the
   CN invariant (``china_board_rank._partition``) and the whole point of the block.
4. **THE STORE SCHEMA.**  ``pool_*`` columns land on the existing candidates store under
   its own rules — schema union, keep-first, null off the pool, no permanently-dead
   column.
5. **GRADUATION DERIVES FROM THE STORE**, not from anything the builder happens to hold
   in memory, and is absent rather than faked when there is no history.

Hermetic: every store test passes ``root=tmp_path`` with ``event_rows={}`` and
``with_context_dims=False``, so nothing reads the repo's real ``data/`` tree.
