"""Release importance decides the desk — a minor print leaves the brand account.

THE DEFECT (operator, 2026-08-05, reading the live @mastermindx001 timeline):
"These posts are so boring, we get absolutely no engagement on them. I think it
will hurt our accounts by posting these really boring economic releases... These
arent the ones people really care about."

Measured from the committed outbox, the SEVEN `kind="breaking"` items the
flagship shipped after the 2026-08-03 clustering fix merged (14:39Z) — i.e. the
live behaviour, with every earlier burst excluded:

    South Korea core inflation           JOLTS job openings
    US non-farm payrolls lookahead       Canada June trade balance
    "Unite Secures Inflation-Beating     investingLive Asia-Pacific FX wrap
     10.5% Pay Package ... GXO Drivers"  USA Trade Balance For June

Not one is a top-tier US release. THE CAUSE IS NOT VOLUME AND NOT DEDUP — the
per-account ceilings were removed by operator order on 2026-08-04, and no
repeat-event burst has shipped since the clustering fix. It is SELECTION:
`breaking_relevance._MACRO_PRINT_KEYWORDS` is a flat list, so every macro print
scores the same base 55.0, and `wire_routing.classes.macro_print: flagship` then
addressed all of them to the brand account. `test_the_flat_list_defect_is_the
_whole_story` pins that equality directly.

BOTH DIMENSIONS BIND. Tier alone leaves GERMANY RETAIL SALES (a tier-1 TOPIC) on
the flagship; economy alone leaves JOLTS and the US trade balance there. The
tests below fail on the pre-2026-08-05 code, where every case returned
"flagship".
