"""Tests for engine/neuralweb/prophet_governor.py — Prophet cross-market governor.

Coverage:
  1. Governor per-market blocks build with tiny fixtures (absent store => data_gap).
  2. Absent store returns data_gap, NOT fabricated zeros (SA-R15).
  3. cross_market block contains NO excess/return keys (PR-R5 hard law).
  4. Suggestions deduplicate by code; first_seen stable.
  5. Suggestion high-severity => count is bounded by _MAX_SUGGESTIONS.
  6. Initial bake: build_and_write writes only the two new artifacts.
