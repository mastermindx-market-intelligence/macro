"""tests/test_marketing_market_clock.py — the 2026-08-02 temporal defect report.

THE THREE CLASSES, AS SHIPPED. Every fixture below is the literal text of a real
outbox row (data/marketing/outbox/items.jsonl), not a paraphrase, so a future
edit that would let one of them out again fails here by name.

  A. ob-2026-08-02-7fb823aecd — PUBLISHED Sunday 2026-08-02 20:16Z, generated
     Sunday 03:50Z. An overnight frame on a weekend, plus "earnings land July
     29" said four days after July 29.
  B. ob-2026-08-01-a83c188711 — generated Saturday 21:49Z, "$AMZN +15.3% today"
     about Friday's session.
  C. six posts anchored on ONE Friday breadth read, fanned across slots
     D1-S1/S5/S6/S10 and four desks in two weekend runs. The sentinel caught
     four; two rode through QUEUED.

WHAT EACH LAYER OWES. Generation stamps the honest word (market_clock ->
market_facts / movers_source / content_studio); enqueue refuses a second post on
one fact; and the PUBLISHER re-asks both questions at the exit, because the
queue is a bypass around every generation law and all three of these were
written honestly and went false while they waited.

MUTATION-CHECKED. Every clock assertion here is paired with a test that BREAKS
the calendar (`is_session_day` forced True — the "no tzdata / no calendar" shape)
and asserts the same fixture then PASSES. Without that pair a green test proves
only that the string was rejected, not that the CLOCK is what rejected it.
