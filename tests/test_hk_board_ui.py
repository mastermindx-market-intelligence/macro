"""Rendered-HTML contract for the HK board priority display layer (hk_prophet_v2 — era bumped 2026-08-03 with the reclaim-veto removal).

Program: research/HK_BOARD_RESURRECTION_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md
Gates covered here: G1 (the seven witnesses are visible), G2 (leaders lane),
G3 (ran lane, marker-anchored, fail-closed on unknown age), G4 (stage buckets +
filter chips + featured + priority score), G9 (fail-soft on pre-v1 artifacts).

TWO SHAPES, ONE TEMPLATE.  The assertions come in pairs: the new schema must
produce the priority surface, and the OLD schema must still produce the flat
three-lane board with none of it.  A regression that quietly drops the fail-soft
branch would ship a broken board the first night the engine lane degrades and the
artifact on disk comes back without `ran[]` / `leaders[]` / the era stamp.

FROZEN FIXTURES, NEVER THE LIVE ARTIFACT (incident 2026-08-04).  Both shapes are
read from committed fixtures pinned to the 2026-07-31 session — the same session
`tests/fixtures/hk_board_2026_07_31.json` and ``BOARD_ASOF`` are pinned to.  They
used to be read from `site/factordata/hk_standouts.json`, which the NIGHTLY
REWRITES, and that is a fixture with a fuse in it: this suite pins BOTH sides of a
one-way migration, so no single state of a live file can satisfy it.  The nightly
at 94568a91302 crossed the boundary (`ran: None→12`, `leaders: None→15`,
`board_definition: None→hk_prophet_v1`, `as_of: 07-31→08-03`) and took NINE gates
here red in one commit, while the same drift silently SKIPPED nine more in
tests/test_hk_board_rank.py through an ``as_of``-mismatch guard — eighteen dark
gates, and the red ones read as a template regression that had never happened.
The live artifact keeps exactly one, era-agnostic assertion here
(``test_the_live_artifact_still_renders``); everything era-specific reads a
fixture.  A fixture that has to be regenerated is a ledger event: re-pin
``BOARD_ASOF``, the price panel and BOTH json files in the same commit, or the
board is being scored against a session it did not happen in.

ASSERTION STYLE (harness law): every presence/absence assertion targets a full
markup string (`'<div class="nb-stage-hd sg-live"'`), never a bare class token.
pv_css() and this page's own <style> block emit the class SELECTORS as literal
text on every render, so `'nb-stage-hd' in html` is true even when nothing
renders — an absence test written that way is vacuous.

TWO FIXTURES, ONE RULE (adversarial review, 2026-08-03).  `production_fixture()` is
the board the nightly will actually ship — every row scored, staged and ordered by
`engine.hk_board_rank`, no synthetic name anywhere — and it is the ONLY thing the
screenshot pass photographs.  `shapes_fixture()` is that board plus the row shapes
the 2026-07-31 tape does not contain (an `approx` anchor, an unmeasurable move, a
blocked buy card, a featured card), on obviously synthetic 88xx.HK "Sample Holdings"
tickers, and it is never photographed.  The behaviour and copy tests run on the
shapes board; a block of fidelity tests at the foot of this file asserts the
production board is free of anything synthetic, so the two can never blur.

    THE SCREENSHOT FIXTURE MUST NOT FLATTER THE BOARD (adversarial review,

    every card with a crc32 stand-in for the priority score, stamped cohort chips by
    hand, and carried the pre-G5 laggards under their old key with the wrong sign —
    so the committed reference shots showed a board that does not exist.  Every

                  lane on 2026-07-31 is three names, and three is the operator's
                  complaint, not something a fixture gets to fix.
      * lanes   — `engine_lanes()` under the production claim order.
      * laggards— re-cut on the shipped selection key, `laggard_z` stamped.
      * chips   — `hk_board_rank.stamp_leadership_chips`, the builder's own helper.
      * ranking — `hk_board_rank.ranking_block` (real weights, points form).
      * the artifact stamps the board reads: rank_by / board_definition /
        universe_excluded / universe_source_rows / lane_counts.

    """THE SAME KNOWN DEFECT, pinned through its second disclosure mechanism.

    The defect has never changed: `ext_z` is set nowhere in
    `scripts/build_hk_library.py`, nowhere in `engine/hk_board_rank.py`, and on no row
    of the frozen 2026-07-31 artifact.  HK has no extension reading at all.  What has
    changed twice is what the shared US machinery DOES about it:

      * #4684 (B3, 2026-08-06) made an absent reading a featured VETO.  On the US
        board that is fail-closed on a wired input that happened to be null.  On HK
        it was UNSATISFIABLE — no wiring exists to repair — so the featured aura went
        dark board-wide, and the predecessor of this test pinned that darkness with
        `featured_count == 0` / `featured_blocked_unknown_extension == 3`.
      * ANTICIPATION v1 (2026-08-08, `us_board_rank`) replaced the absence-veto with a
        per-row disclosure after the same veto published a US featured lane of 0 out
        of 69 on a one-night data gap.  HK inherits that wholesale, so the shelf is
        reachable again — by rows whose chase-risk check still has no input.

    That inheritance is a CROSS-MARKET consequence of a US-program change and it is
    pinned here rather than left to a board diff.  The HK repair is unchanged and is
    still a board-owner call, not a CI heal: wire an HK extension reading, or scope
    the leg off the way `reclaim_veto=False` already scopes off the other leg HK
    cannot satisfy (`signal_quality._confirm_legs` calls that one "an UNSATISFIABLE
    condition" in as many words).

    WHAT THIS TEST MAY NOT DO IS PIN A TAUTOLOGY (audit finding, 2026-08-09).  It
    previously asserted `featured_with_unknown == featured_count`, which is
    identically true given the assertion three lines above it that EVERY row is
    `ext_unknown` — if every row is unknown then every featured row is unknown, for
    any board, under any code.  Worse, on this fixture both sides are 0 (the real
    2026-07-31 tape features nothing, held by `adv_unknown`), so it compared zero to
    zero and would have survived the absence-veto being reinstated.  Replaced with
    claims that can fail: the gap is real and total, the absence no longer vetoes, and
    the shelf stays BOUNDED by its caps now that a veto is no longer doing the
    bounding for it.  The DISCLOSURE-reaches-the-reader half is pinned separately, on
    rendered HTML, in the test directly below.

# ── THE FIVE GATES THE VETOED LANE'S CONFIRMATION ANCHOR OWNS (sparse policy R8) ──
# These five read a MEASURED vetoed-lane move, and that move only exists when the
# confirmation close can be derived.  `hk_board_rank.confirmation_move()` walks the
# HK session grid through `signal_quality.confirmation_date(..., market="HK")`, which
# anchors on `data/hk/_HSI.parquet` — a COMMITTED tree that a sparse session worktree
# omits (R8: data/, site/, mockups/, verify_shots/ are 87 % of the checkout).
#
# The degradation is SILENT, which is the whole reason this needs a marker rather
# than the conftest's traceback attribution.  `confirmation_move()` catches the
# session-anchor FileNotFoundError on purpose — a missing reference is the disclosed-
# null case it already documents, not a crash the nightly should take — so every
# vetoed row comes back `pct_since: null`, no traceback ever names `data/`, and the
# conftest sparse annotator has nothing to match on.  What a sparse tree sees instead
# is five clean assertion failures that read exactly like template-vs-fixture drift:
# "fixture has no measured moves", a missing `pbv-pop` block, and 9961.HK — which
# earns its seat in the vetoed lane — vanishing from the witness count.
#
# Measured 2026-08-19 on origin/main bytes (f69f224c9723) in a sparse worktree:
# 5 failed / 97 passed / 1 skipped.  `git sparse-checkout add data/hk` on the same
# bytes, nothing else changed: 102 passed / 1 skipped.  No test flips the other way,
# so the tree is the whole difference and these five are the whole blast radius.
# CI is unaffected — `unrun-hk-board` runs on a full `actions/checkout@v4`.
#
# Marked, not deleted or loosened: in a full checkout (CI, the nightly host, any tree
# that ran `worktree_sparse.py full`) all five still gate exactly as before.

    Those gates are pinned on a chip `shapes_fixture()` stamps by hand (#4889), which is
    the right call — the column, the mobile budget and the HKRV-R5 disclosure must stay
    tested — but it means nothing above notices that the REAL strip carries no cohort
    member at all.  This does.  On the 2026-07-31 panel the leaders strip carries ZERO
    (it was two), the strip fills 14 of LEADERS_CAP=15, and `ran` fills 3 of 12.

    Root cause, measured 2026-08-07: `signal_quality.signal_frame` joins the
    calendar-absolute W-FRI weekly leg onto the 3D grid's INDEX LABEL —

        wbull = (wm >= wsg).shift(1).reindex(s3.index, method="ffill")

    — while a bucket's `close` is its LAST close.  R-SQ2 made that label the bucket's
    OPEN date, so each 3D bar is handed the weekly regime from up to a bucket before its
    own close.  Joining on `_tf_grid(...).last_session` instead flips `weekly_bull` on 28
    of 157 names here, and `weekly_bull is True` is half the leaders admission gate
    (`hk_board_rank.build_leaders_rows`); with it, 0941.HK and 9618.HK re-enter the strip
    and leaders/ran/vetoed all fill their caps (15/15, 12/12, 12/12).

    NOT REPAIRED IN THE PR THAT WROTE THIS TEST, deliberately.  The join is not an R-SQ2
    regression — `git log -S` puts the line at the module's original commit, and the
    retired 3B label was the synthetic LEFT edge too (mean 1.87 sessions before the close
    it carried), so this has always been label-anchored; the era only removed a truncation
    bin that had been masking it at this as-of.  Repairing it is therefore a SEMANTIC
    REVISION, not a defect repair, and R-SQ6 pins `_confirm_legs` semantics as
    "byte-identical".  It owes: `ANCHOR_ERA` bumped (R-SQ3), a committed blast-radius
    report (R-SQ4 — 107/157 marker lists move on the HK panel alone; US/CN/CA unmeasured),
    and the two sibling joins fixed with it (`above200` at 0.30% disagreement,
    `rising2_on3` at 19.76%) so `_confirm_legs` does not read two different as-of dates.
    `engine/canon.py:370,444` — the golden oracle — already joins the weekly on the
    bucket's last session and calls it leak-free; that is the precedent that work should
    cite.  Full site table: research/SQ_BUCKET_LABEL_AS_DATE_FINDINGS_2026-08-07.md.
