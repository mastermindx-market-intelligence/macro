"""ONE coverage shape across the options family (OIP R8).

Four builders each answered "how much of the universe did we see?" differently, and one
of them (build_flow_desk) answered it in a STRING no machine could read.  No surface
could put two side by side; no audit could compare them.  ``lib/options_coverage.py``
defines the shape once and all four now emit it under ``coverage_v1``.

These tests pin: the schema, the honesty rules (unknown stays None, never 0 or a
fabricated 100%), the calendar-derived staleness (never wall-clock days), the plain-word
bilingual naming (gate 4/5: no slugs, no enums, no "n=", in either language), and — the
load-bearing part — that all four builders actually construct it, ADDITIVELY, with every
pre-existing key intact.
