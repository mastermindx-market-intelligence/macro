"""tests/test_support_tier_routing.py — plan-based support routing (packet B-F13-3).

Covers lib.help_directory.route_for_tier (pure) and app/support.py's threading of that
routing into the ticket receipt, the operator notification subject/kv, and row["meta"].
Follows the tests/test_support_api.py idiom: the route function is called directly with a
fake Request/BackgroundTasks so no HTTP client or heavy app.main import is needed.
