"""The US track-record era boundary: the stamp, the frozen pre-era block, and the guard.

Era break ruled by the Fable main loop 2026-08-07
(``research/US_TRACK_RECORD_ERA_BREAK_PROPOSAL.md`` §0.1). ``_ob_mask`` inherited PR
#4732's absolute session anchor by direct import, which moved every published number in
``site/factordata/us_track_ledger.json`` without appearing in that PR's diff, its
blast-radius report, or R5's era-stamp channel. These tests pin the three things that
close it:

  §0.2  the era string is carried IN the artifact, not only in a commit message;
  §0.3  the pre-era headline is preserved and shown — including across repeated
        recomputes, which is where the obvious implementation self-erases;
  ruling the writer REFUSES a headline move that carries no matching stamp, and says so
        with a line-start ::error annotation.

The guard tests drive the REAL ``engine.track_ledger.atomic_write``. A test that
re-implements the comparison would stay green with the guard deleted.
