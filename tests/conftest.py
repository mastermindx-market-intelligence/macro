"""Test-suite conftest.py — repo-wide pytest configuration.

COLLECT_LANE sentinel
---------------------
Forward-ledger writers gate on ``COLLECT_LANE=nightly`` (or the legacy alias
``US_LANE=nightly``).  All pre-existing tests that call a writer function and
expect a write to succeed were written before the gate existed; rather than
touching every test file we set the sentinel here at session scope via an
autouse fixture.

Tests that explicitly verify the *blocked* path (e.g. TestUsLaneGate in
test_basket_turn_watch.py) pop COLLECT_LANE / US_LANE directly via
``os.environ.pop`` — that overrides the autouse value and the gate fires as
expected.  Monkeypatch-based gate tests work identically (``monkeypatch.delenv``
removes the key before the assertion, and monkeypatch restores after).

data/ + site/ write tripwire (MM_DATA_GUARD)
--------------------------------------------
Because COLLECT_LANE=nightly is armed for every test, any test that reaches a
writer WITHOUT isolation (root= param, monkeypatched lib.config
data_dir/ROOT) mutates the repo's REAL data/ tree.  Those writes ride any
later ``git add data/`` from the same checkout (nightly data commits, agent
sweeps) and permanently pollute forward ledgers —
data/foresight/policy_calendar_ledger.jsonl carries a committed synthetic
test row (theme=solar, asof=2026-07-03, logged 2026-07-04T00:30:49Z) from
exactly this failure mode.

The tracked site/ tree has the same failure mode through builder entry
points that default their output dir to the repo's real site/ (render
helpers, snapshot writers): synthetic test fixtures overwrite committed
pages/JSON and ride any later ``git add site/``.  Render-oriented tests are
legitimate — they must redirect output (tmp_path out dir, monkeypatched
lib.config ROOT/SITE), never write the real tree.

The guard snapshots ``git status --porcelain`` for each watched tree
(``data/``, ``site/``) at session start and fails the run (exit 1) when NEW
entries appear by session end.  Modes via the MM_DATA_GUARD env var:

  (unset)  session-level tripwire (default; two git calls per session)
  off      disable entirely (deliberate data-writing local flows only)
  trace    per-test attribution — re-checks after EVERY test and reports the
           offending nodeids in the session-end summary (slow: one git status
           per test; use it to hunt a culprit, not in CI)

Known limitation: a file already dirty at session start that is modified
*further* during the session produces an identical porcelain line and is not
detected.  Fresh checkouts (CI, new worktrees) start clean, which is the main
protection surface.  Writes under gitignored paths are invisible to git and
likewise not detected (they also cannot be committed).

sys.modules eviction tripwire (MM_MODULE_GUARD)
-----------------------------------------------
A test that removes a name from sys.modules, or rebinds one to a different
module object, and does not put the original back poisons every LATER test in
the process.  The victim lands in an unrelated FILE, so the failure only appears
when the collected file set happens to pair culprit and victim — the failure set
moves as files are added, which reads as flake and gives a real regression
somewhere to hide.  Measured 2026-08-06: a `requests` eviction in
test_admin_live_runs.py killed test_capital_structure_share_count_materializer.py
three files later, and both suites are green in isolation.

Checked after EVERY test, in the post-yield half of the teardown hookwrapper —
the only window where all fixture finalizers, monkeypatch.undo included, have
already run.  Additions are ignored, and importlib.reload() keeps a module's
identity, so the ~40 files that reload are unaffected.  Modes via the
MM_MODULE_GUARD env var: (unset) on | off disable entirely.
See tests/test_no_module_leak.py for the static half and the mechanism pins.

    overrides the synthetic cfg a unit test constructed, and a routine admin
    click turns CI red on main with no code change at all.

# writer (root-aware); a test that drives it without a tmp root would write the
# REAL data/master_brain/reply_cache tree — the exact class this guard exists
# for. DISABLE the cache for every test (get misses, put drops) rather than
# emulate it in memory: an emulated cache makes two same-prompt stubbed calls
# inside one test serve the first reply to the second, breaking tests that
# stub different replies per call (producer suite). The dedicated roundtrip
# tests opt out by name to exercise the real helpers under tmp_path.
#
# An opted-out test MUST isolate itself (root=tmp / absolute reply_cache_dir).
# Keep this set in sync when a roundtrip test is added: an un-listed one reads
# GREEN while asserting nothing (get is stubbed to always-miss, put to a no-op)
# — test_w7_llm_determinism.py::test_master_brain_cache_hit sat that way until
# its check() ledger was gated (2026-08-09).

# red — 8 failures asserting cross-account near-dup quarantines and non-empty
# `receipts` queues that can only hold while those desks are enabled. Nothing in
# the marketing engine had changed. Worse, that job is path-filtered to
# engine/marketing/**, so it fires ONLY on marketing PRs: the breakage was
# invisible on every other PR and would have ambushed the next marketing change.

# Card-path logo resolvers are CACHE-ONLY under pytest — no CDN, no repo litter.
#
# chart_render.resolve_logo / resolve_color_logo hardcode ``fetch=True`` into
# logo_cache (chart_render.py:1732,1745), so ANY test that composes a card with
# a logo_root whose ticker misses the cache fetches the nvstly CDN AT TEST TIME
# and writes <root>/data/marketing/logos/<TICKER>_{white,color}.png
# (logo_cache.py:172-173,224-225).
#
# 2026-08-08: tests/test_marketing_filing_lanes.py::
# test_filing_items_take_a_real_d1_ladder_slot deliberately composes a real
# content plan against the REPO root (it reads the repo's tracked filing /
# house-pick supply and skips if empty), so every run littered 24 untracked
# *_color.png into the real tree. That tree is one the nightly lane COMMITS —
# regime-update commits carry data/marketing/logos/ — so test litter could ride
# straight into a production data commit. MM_DATA_GUARD catches it only on a
# FRESH baseline: a warm checkout that already holds the litter is silent by the
# guard's documented known limitation, which is how this survived. And the
# litter set is data-dependent (whatever tickers today's tracked supply names),
# so CI was never stably red on it either.
#
# Downgrade both resolvers to cache-only for every test. Seeded tmp-root caches
# and the tracked repo set still resolve; a miss is None — no network, no write,
# any root. Tests that exercise the FETCH path call engine.marketing.logo_cache
# directly with a stubbed ``requests`` (tests/test_watchlist_card.py:448) and
# never cross this seam, so no opt-out is needed. Per-suite stubs that pin their
# own resolver return value still win: conftest autouse fixtures instantiate
# BEFORE module-level ones, and monkeypatch teardown is LIFO.
#
# One test was relying on the fetch: test_earnings_card's _write_logo_cache
# seeded only <TICKER>_white.png while render_earnings_card resolves through
# resolve_color_logo, so "test_logo_embeds_from_cache" was in fact asserting on
# a live download of Apple's real icon. Fixed at the seam it belonged to — that
# helper now seeds both cache files.
