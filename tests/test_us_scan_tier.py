"""Tests for the §4.5 US SCAN TIER — the widened seeing set ("see everything, admit
selectively").

The tier ships across four modules, and the regressions worth catching are the ones
that would let the widened set quietly become authority, quietly double-count a name,
or quietly render an unrestored store as "no runners tonight":

* ``engine/us_scan_universe.py`` — the liquidity floor. It is a DISPLAYED rule, so the
  printed sentence and the applied comparison must move together; and it must attribute
  every dropped name to exactly one reason, in evaluation order, so the counts sum to
  the store total.
* ``engine/us_context_vector.py`` — the ``tier`` discriminator. Two lanes stamp the same
  monthly part on the same night; the store is only usable for cohort work if the two
  populations never blur and no name survives twice.
* ``engine/prophet_miss_audit.py`` — the scan-tier audit + the W0 mirror. An absent store
  must be a DISCLOSED null carrying the rule that did not run, never an empty runner list.
* ``scripts/heal_shallow_caches.py`` — a splice into a live cache. Prepend-only,
  target-schema-preserving, idempotent: anything less silently rewrites data a consumer
  already trusts.

Hermetic by construction: every test passes ``root=tmp_path``/``event_rows={}``/
``with_context_dims=False`` or builds its own synthetic store under ``tmp_path``. No test
reads the repo's real ``data/`` tree, hits the network, or writes outside tmp_path
(MM_DATA_GUARD). Deterministic: prices are constructed, never randomised, and no
assertion reads a wall clock — the tier's own ``price_through`` is the store's last bar.

# curated_universe — the yahoo-parquet proxy, and the hub backfill that breaks it
#
# `curated_universe` is the set EXCLUDED from the scan tier, and one of its legs
# uses "has a data/yahoo parquet" as a proxy for "is in the curated roster". That
# proxy held while collectors/yahoo.py was the only writer, whose fetch list IS a
# curated universe. scripts/backfill_yahoo_universe.py breaks it: a parquet then
# means "the hub signal ledger mentioned this ticker", which is the opposite of
# curated. Measured 2026-08-08, a fully drained backfill queue would have moved
# 4,601 names out of the scan tier this way — silently, because the exclusion is
# an ABSENCE and nothing prints it.
