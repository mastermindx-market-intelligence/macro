"""TrendSpider hardening PR-C — chart director, timeframe facts, follow-ups.

THE FOUR GATES THIS SUITE EXISTS FOR (masterplan §0). Each one is written so
that REVERTING the enforcement turns it red, not so that it merely exercises a
happy path:

  1. the claim-window law   — a fact whose evidence window is wider than the
                              widest permitted axis is REFUSED, and the refusal
                              is visible in ``ChartSpec.rejected``.
  2. the forming-bar law    — a Friday-partial week never reaches a fact.
  3. in-frame restatement   — a caption number the chart does not draw is a
                              violation.
  4. the long-tail quota    — a shortfall prints a bare line-start ``::warning``.

Everything else here is the doctrine table, the grammar budgets, and the
degradation paths (empty pools, short history) that must not fabricate.
