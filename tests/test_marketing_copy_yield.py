"""tests/test_marketing_copy_yield.py — W4e copy-lane yield (masterplan §8).

Program: ``research/X_GROWTH_SUPERINTELLIGENCE_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md`` §8.2 W4e.

THE NIGHT THIS FILE EXISTS FOR (2026-08-02, in production). The copy lane
attempted 79 posts and shipped 7. The single largest cause was 32 drops reading
``provider returned no text`` — a string that names an outage and sends the
reader to check credentials. It was neither. That exact string is reachable from
ONE branch of ``copywriter._call``: the provider ANSWERED, the reply was not the
contracted ``{"text": ...}`` object, ``_v2_extract_text`` returned "" and the
item was dropped on the spot with ``fault`` never set — no retry, no failover,
no rung named, and an editorial-looking census entry for a post no validator
ever saw. Every other provider-fault path in that function sets a named reason
(``provider_no_text:``, ``provider_error:``, ``provider_refusal``,
``provider_unavailable:``), so the legacy string is a fingerprint, not a
coincidence.

And the second cause, 19 ``number soup`` drops, was the prompt fighting its own
validator: the HARD BANS block ordered "ONE number per post" while
``number_budget_for`` — the single source of truth — has never once returned 1.
On all 154 items of that plan the model was handed a cap no post could satisfy
and that no gate enforced.

TWO LAWS BIND EVERY TEST HERE:

  * A PROVIDER drop (nothing usable came back) may be retried. An EDITORIAL drop
    (a validator refused a draft the model wrote) may not, and the tests below
    pin BOTH directions — a one-directional guard leaves the quiet half open.
  * NO GATE MOVES. ``_NUMBER_BUDGET``, ``_SHAPE_NUMBER_BUDGET`` and
    ``_NUMBER_BUDGET_DEFAULT`` are pinned by value here precisely because the
    fix is next door to them: what changed is what the writer is TOLD, never
    what the validator ALLOWS.

Fixture-driven; ZERO live network, ZERO live LLM. Every provider-path test hands
``engine.llm_auth.build_providers`` a fake provider whose client is a local
object, so the REAL waterfall and the REAL request builder run and only the
transport is fake.
