"""Geometry pins for the breaking radar card (W4g, operator 2026-08-02).

The operator's verdict on the one post that shipped that day: *"the illustration
needs fixing (text too small for both mobile and web, needs to be much larger
and digestible, too much whitespace too; and the title header is too long and
gets cut off)"*.

Before this suite existed, ``tests/test_marketing_breaking_card.py`` asserted
structure, escaping and presence — and NOT ONE geometry value.  So the card
could (and did) ship with:

* a 15.5px summary carrying the primary information — ~5.3 CSS px once X
  renders the 2000×1120 PNG in a ~340 CSS px mobile media well;
* a headline size table that bottomed out at ``>150 chars → 26px/56ch/3 lines``,
  i.e. ~168 characters displayed and everything past that hard-clipped with an
  ellipsis.  The live 2026-08-02 Iran item's ``headline`` is the entire Truth
  Social post — 814 characters — so the card cut mid-sentence at "…World War II…"
  and the actual news (the attack was CANCELLED) never appeared in the hero.

Every test here fails on the pre-fix renderer.  The three load-bearing ones and
the mutation that catches each:

===============================  ==========================================
test                             mutation it catches
===============================  ==========================================
no_ellipsis_in_hero              restore the wrap-then-clip ellipsis, or
(the real 814-char fixture)      remove the derive_card_headline() bound
body_font_size_floor             drop the summary back to any size < 26
headline_reconstructs_verbatim   any silent truncation anywhere in the path
===============================  ==========================================

The fixture is the REAL artifact, read from ``data/marketing/outbox/items.jsonl``
when present and pinned verbatim in this file otherwise, so the suite still
guards on a fresh checkout with no data tree.
