"""TP-1 (theme-parity-tp1-canada-20260828-sol-001): contract tests for the
governed Canada stock-dashboard stylesheet pair
(templates/stock-dashboard.css / site/stock-dashboard.css).

Canada's V3.8 composer (site/canada-stock-v36.js) used to author its own
presentation as a runtime `<style>` tag built from JS string concatenation
(injectCss()) — exactly the opaque runtime stylesheet system
research/THEME_PARITY_RATCHET_PRESENTATION_CONVERGENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md §4-5
and the house theme-parity law forbid on a governed surface. This wave moves
every rule injectCss() used to own into this governed, token-clean, paired
plain-copy stylesheet instead. These tests freeze the boundary:

  * the hidden-attribute visibility overrides the composer's
    ``card.hidden = !show`` mechanism depends on (pinned separately in
    tests/test_canada_v36_composer.py) now live here, scoped under the
    canonical ``.mx-stockdash--ca`` mount class;
  * the mobile one-lane Act-Now grammar (previously pinned against the
    composer's injected CSS text) lives here too;
  * the stance/lane-header color family reads the Prophet stance tokens,
    never a market-direction literal;
  * the stylesheet is byte-identical between templates/ and site/ (paired
    plain-copy asset law); and
  * the stylesheet is token-clean per TP-0 design-system enforcement — no
    color/font/radius literals, no parallel :root token family, no emoji.
