"""W5b EDGE chips wiring tests.

Edge 1: CN drawdown radar sleeve-size chip in china.html.j2 stocks board header.
  T1 — chip renders when setups.sleeve_chip has a valid radar_state
  T2 — chip absent when setups.sleeve_chip is None (degrade-don't-crash)
  T3 — chip absent when radar_state is None
  T4 — chip absent when mode == 'macro' (dual-mode isolation)
  T5 — 'caution' state → var(--warn) accent colour
  T6 — 'elevated'/'risk-off' state → var(--down) accent colour
  T7 — dual-span EN/ZH in chip (no CJK inside title= or HTML attribute values)
  T8 — no affirmative 'Validated'/'validated' text emitted in chip HTML
  T9 — help tooltip text is not empty / accessible
  T10 — chip does not appear in macro mode render (Jinja parse + render)

Edge 2: AI-semis confirmer chip wired in sector_central_china.html.j2 + build script
(was baskets_china.html.j2 until the 2026-08 China Sector Intelligence consolidation).
  T11 — is_target_basket recognises AI-supply basket IDs
  T12 — compute() returns dict with 'on', 'state', 'targets' keys on degraded (null) path
  T13 — build_baskets_china_ths.py imports and calls cn_ai_semis_confirmer without error
  T14 — sector_central_china.html.j2 has #semis-chip host element and renderSemisChip() call
  T15 — sector_central_china.html.j2 semis chip JS: label_en / label_zh dual-lang path
