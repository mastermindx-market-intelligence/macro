        Era history, because this constant has now been all four things:
          * pre-2026-08-04 the US and CN maps were IDENTICAL, on the premise that
            the entry-status vocabulary is market-independent;
          * 2026-08-04 the CN V1 loser audit refuted that premise for the VALUES —
            in the legacy split-adjusted A-share comparator the patience statuses were
            the era's best cohort
            (bounce_wait 6.9% loser rate) and the action statuses its worst
            (buy_now 30.0%; CN masterplan §2.3/§2.11).  This was ordinary return
            context, not exact legal-band evidence.  cn_prophet_v3 adopted that
            order; the US map kept the trend-tape order;
          * 2026-08-08, first draft of A2: the US map adopted the CN ordering on
            the parity anatomy's evidence.  It never reached main;
          * 2026-08-08, this amendment: the §6.6 US re-measurement's first run
            (`research/prophet_us_audit/US_STATUS_REMEASUREMENT_2026-08-08.md`,
            2,816 statused episodes, 23 board dates 06-15..07-30) read ADVERSE —
            buy lane H=5 `bounce_wait` 54.9% loser (n=153) vs `buy_now` 39.0%
            (n=95), H=10 `bounce_wait` 65.4% (n=52), and the watch lane repeating

            marks at H=21 anywhere out of 345 episodes, with H=63 never matured for
            any status — so the horizon the patience thesis actually claims has no
            US data at all.

        The short ruler refutes the CN order; the right ruler is unmeasured.  So the
        map claims NOTHING about the order among admissible statuses, and this test
        is what keeps it that way.  Re-introducing an ordering — patience-first,
        chase-first, or any other — must go through the pre-registered revision rule
