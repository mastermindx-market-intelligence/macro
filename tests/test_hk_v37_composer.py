"""Static-shell and enhancement pins for the HK Stock Dashboard V3.8.

site/hk-stock-v36.js is the HK composer, corrected to V3.8 per
research/STOCK_DASHBOARD_V38_ACTION_LEADERSHIP_ARCHITECTURE.md and
DEC:V38-ACTION-IS-NOT-LEADERSHIP (carrier
stock-dashboard-v38-hk-ca-fable-20260826-sol-001). Canonical V3.8 law:
ACTION TIMING ≠ TREND LEADERSHIP. These pins hold the constitution in place:

  Laws still controlling:
  - Top Picks is the owner's pv-featured cohort, never a position slice.
  - No LIVE plane exists for HK — no LIVE text, no live-quote enhancement,
    zero fetch() calls anywhere.
  - Evidence & Record and the HK track-record owner render in place; the
    composer never moves or recomputes them.
  - Leadership/action-group filtering never silently switches the Top
    Picks / All Candidates population.
  - Grid/Table and card filters preserve owner show-more state.
  - The Southbound flow cue is gated on the owner's own materiality marker
    (.sbah-sig sig-in/sig-out/sig-neu), never on mere node existence.
  - The loader (templates/dashboard-icons.js + site/ pair) retry pins.

  V3.8 corrections (new pins below):
  - What to Act On Now renders AT REST above Prophet — never only inside
    the Expand-leadership modal — with the exact owner-native lanes, at
    most 3 group rows per lane before View all, and name-first rows with
    no performance/score/percentile towers.
  - The visible sector rank is the OWNER's Sector Rotation rank rendered
    as `RS #N` under a visible "Relative strength vs HSI" basis label; a
    sector the owner did not rank shows "—" — lane traversal order is
    never minted into a rank number.
  - Action stance stays a separate axis/field from rank (RS #1 can be
    Reduce / Avoid; that is information, not a contradiction).
  - The ambiguous BOARD count label is gone: the count column is labelled
    Prophet/候选 and renders only when canonical membership is known —
    unknown membership must never render as zero.
  - Mobile (§5.5): one segmented lane selector, one lane body at a time;
    lane switching never mutates the Prophet selection.
