"""tests/test_prophet_live_evaluator.py — Prophet Live P0 gates G0.2, G0.3, G0.5, G0.6.

The */5 lane's job is to say one of six honest things about a name, or say nothing.
This file pins the four ways it could stop being honest:

  G0.2 LEDGER LAW      it writes no ``data/`` path and commits nothing, ever.
  G0.3 DEGRADATION     a stale pack darks the WHOLE artifact; a stale or missing
                       quote darks THAT NAME and leaves the rest live. No path
                       invents a state, and every dark carries a reason.
  G0.5 DEBOUNCE        one pass above a trigger is never a public state; two are; a
                       breach through the buffer on EITHER edge fades and a marginal
                       one does not; a re-cross pays two again.
  G0.6 VOCABULARY      fired / confirmed / refuted / validated / 证伪 appear nowhere
                       in the payload or the module.

EVERY TEST PINS ITS CLOCK. The ET window, the confirm cutoff and the last-completed-
session gate are all wall-clock logic, so a fixture with a bare date literal is a
scheduled red waiting for a Tuesday. ``NOW`` is passed explicitly everywhere and the
session-date fixtures are derived from it, never from ``datetime.now``.
