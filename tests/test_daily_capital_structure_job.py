"""The capital-structure lane owns its own job, and its blast radius is itself.

`daily.yml`'s capital-structure chain is an all-or-nothing SEC publication
protocol.  Its compilers are FATAL BY DESIGN — no `continue-on-error`, no
quarantine, no fail-soft — because a partial generation must never be committed
(#4578 added `continue-on-error` to the event spine and was correctly reverted).

That contract is right for the lane and was catastrophic where the lane used to
live.  Inside `collect`, a fatal-by-design chain sat in the one job the whole
nightly hangs off, and three DISTINCT capital-structure defects redded the
entire nightly on three consecutive nights:

    2026-08-04  #4600  pyarrow schema unification broke manifest identity
    2026-08-05  #4640  the SEC-HEADER opener grammar EDGAR actually emits
    2026-08-06  #4740  observation-lineage bytes

Every fix was correct.  The PLACEMENT was the defect, so 2026-08-06 moved the
chain into the `capital_structure` job (`needs: collect`) that nothing needs in
turn.  These tests pin both halves: the lane keeps its undiluted all-or-nothing
law INSIDE the job, and the job cannot reach anything outside itself.

**The handoff is the load-bearing part of the split, and the least obvious.**
Every other post-collect job in this workflow (`us_scan_tier`, `collect_tail`)
reads its inputs from the COMMITTED tree.  This one cannot.  `run collectors`
(`sec_capital_structure`) APPENDS tonight's rows to the TRACKED
`source_manifest.jsonl`, and `collect`'s market checkpoint deliberately UNSTAGES
that path — an unaccepted source ledger must not be committed, and that carve-out
is exactly what preserves #4600's self-heal.  So tonight's rows exist only in
`collect`'s workspace and must cross the job boundary as an artifact.

If they did not, the failure would be silent rather than loud: a fresh
`actions/checkout` would serve the LAST COMMITTED ledger, the compilers would
reproduce yesterday byte-for-byte, "no capital-structure changes to commit"
would print, and the lane would freeze forever while every step stayed green.
Measured on this tree 2026-08-06: 1,258 rows committed against 1,447 in the run
— 189 rows a night lost, their retained R2 bytes orphaned.  So the download is
pinned to precede every compiler, and the receipt check that proves the bytes
are tonight's is pinned to be fatal.
