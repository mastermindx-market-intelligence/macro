"""Public dossier quote projection — the honesty boundary for a live US price.

The dossier used to bake a nightly price into HTML and print a decorative
"Live" stamp beside it.  On 2026-08-27 that shipped NVDA at $209.66 with a
static ``-$3.39 · -1.59%`` while the measured regular-session close was
$227.98 (+8.74%) — the page claimed "Live" while showing the PREVIOUS close
and a previous-day move.  That is the defect this route exists to make
impossible.

The tests below pin the three properties that keep it impossible:

1. The route never invents freshness.  ``live`` is returned only when the
   upstream quote plane itself asserts a measured realtime row AND that row's
   own timestamp is inside the accepted bound.  A delayed basis, a stale
   timestamp, or a missing clock all fail CLOSED to an honest weaker state.
2. The regular-session move is computed from the regular-session fields only.
   An extended-hours print must never become the regular-session percentage.
3. The projection is allowlisted and debranded.  No vendor name, no raw
   upstream payload, no transport internals reach the browser.

# pairing is deliberate — the 503 regression of 2026-08-27 shipped because every
# fixture in this file was an RTH capture, so no test ever exercised the state
# the page is actually in for most of the day.
#
# The load-bearing difference is the ANCHOR.  With no session in hand today, the
# hub's anchor has already rolled forward to the last completed close, so
# `prevClose` EQUALS `last` and the naive move is exactly zero.  `chg` and
# `prevSessionChg` still carry the move that produced that close, and upstream
# publishes `prevSessionChg` precisely to say "the move you want is the previous
# session's" — it deletes the field the moment today's session is in hand.
