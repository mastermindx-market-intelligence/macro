"""W4f — the mastermind_news arming, and the config knobs W4a/W4d read.

WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR. Arming a desk is a CONFIG act with a wide code blast
radius: seven modules resolve liveness through
``engine.marketing.accounts.effective_accounts`` and change behaviour the moment
one boolean moves. A config change with no test is a change nobody can refute, so
every claim the arming makes is pinned here against the SHIPPED
``config/marketing.yml`` — never a fixture. A fixture would prove that the code
can arm a desk; only the real file proves that THIS desk IS armed.

Five claims, in the order the masterplan §8.2 W4f gates state them:

  1. mastermind_news resolves ENABLED through the accounts model, with the
     legacy ``disabled`` key gone rather than flipped, so the two keys cannot
     disagree (``accounts._config_enabled`` lets ``enabled`` win, which is
     exactly how a stale ``disabled: true`` would read dark to a human and live
     to the code).
  2. It starts on the COLD ramp tier with the cold caps, and it gets there
     DELIBERATELY — ``created:`` present and parsed — not by ``resolve_ramp``
     failing closed, which produces the identical tier for the opposite reason.
  3. The wire classes route where the charter says: stance-free relay classes to
     the wire desk, house-view classes to the flagship.
  4. The W4a/W4d config knobs exist under the exact key paths those lanes read.
  5. hot_tape's overrides stay in config/hot_tape.yml — there is deliberately NO
     second home for them in marketing.yml.

DETERMINISM. Every ramp assertion is anchored to the desk's OWN ``created:``
date plus a fixed offset, never to the wall clock: a suite that asserts "cold
today" is a bomb that detonates on day 14 (see the fixture-date-plus-wall-clock
trap). Tier boundaries are asserted on BOTH sides so the cold window is pinned as
a window, not as a moment.
