"""Freshness sentinel (masterplan W1) — the dead-man switch outside GitHub.

The load-bearing tests are the two failure modes of the 2026 outages:
  * §0.1 acceptance gate — a simulated dead nightly (every bake stamp >26h old)
    must produce a breach report, a composed operator alert, and a DELIVERED
    transport, proven against a real local webhook receiver (no mocks on the
    HTTP path).
  * the Jul-31→Aug-6 replay — the page re-baked every day of that outage while
    the board froze, and the page carries per-panel "as of" dates (options
    ceilings, rotation tooltips) that stay fresh throughout. The board check
    must anchor on the delayed-board marker the template renders only when the
    engine itself reports the lag, and must NOT be fooled by fresh peripheral
    as-of strings.
  * the 2026-08-08 Prophet replay — the same re-stamp trap one layer down.
    data/us_prophet_rank/candidates/2026-08.parquet froze at stamp_date
    2026-08-05 while us_stocks.html re-baked fresh every day, so BOTH checks
    above stayed green through it. The prophet_us surface anchors on the store's
    own ``asof`` measured against the NYSE session calendar, so the weekend the
    freeze was found on cannot excuse it and cannot fake it either.

#
# 2026-08-27: a pre-#6554 build stamped as_of=2026-08-27 MID-SESSION. The */5
# evaluator refused the pack as stale_pack all day; this surface read it "ok
# (0 sessions behind)", because sessions_behind floors a future-dated stamp at
# 0 by its own docstring ("no completed session is missing"). The fence: as_of
# must be neither behind beyond the existing budget NOR ahead of
# expected_last_session — an ahead stamp is its own named breach
# (pack_ahead_of_calendar) with no grace.
