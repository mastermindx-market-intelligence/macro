"""No entitlement-gated payload may reach the committed candidates store.

`data/us_prophet_rank/candidates/*.parquet` is tracked in a PUBLIC repository.
`engine.neuralweb.context_api.context_frame` flattens each Context Snapshot
dimension's whole ``value`` dict into columns with no allowlist, and
`engine.us_context_vector.context_dimension_frame` merges the result into the
row that gets committed. That pair put the compact Filing Forensics findings —
the same rows `/api/forensics/state` serves only behind `require_site_full_user`
— into a tracked parquet for 722 tickers, where `git clone` reads them.

Two guards here, and the second is the one that lasts:

1. the named paid columns are dropped at the committing seam; and
2. EVERY non-scalar column in the stamped frame is explicitly classified as
   either forbidden or reviewed. The flatten is generic, so without (2) the next
   dimension to grow a paid body leaks in exactly the way forensics did — the
   defect would recur under a different column name and this file would still
   pass.

(2) is a HARD FAILURE and stays one: a producer must classify its column, and a
test that merely warned would be a suggestion. What changed on 2026-08-14 is what
happens at RUNTIME to a column that reached the writer unclassified anyway —
`engine.us_context_vector._contain_unclassified_nonscalars` drops it and prints a
line-start `::warning`, so it costs that column instead of the whole night's
stamp. `regime__live` cost six nights of a committed store precisely because the
only runtime consequence was a `to_parquet` that raised into a fail-soft catch.
The two halves are pinned against each other in
:func:`test_the_runtime_drop_and_the_hard_fail_law_agree` below: the runtime must
never keep something this file would fail on, and never drop something it blesses.
