"""tests/test_marketing_anchor_law.py — the 2026-08-01 anchorless-macro kill.

Three macro/event posts cleared every deterministic gate, cleared the batch
auditor, were APPROVED, and were then pulled off the queue by hand:

    "4 of 11 sectors green on a day growth data firmed and inflation stayed
     warm. Not a clean enough read to lean on yet."                (flagship)
    "Not a clearcut tape. Growth firming a bit, inflation still warm, and only
     4 of 11 sectors managed green. I'm watching, not deciding."   (founder)
    "growth data firmed a touch while inflation stayed warm. 4 of 11 sectors
     closed green. steady liquidity is the part i'm watching..."   (kelly)

Operator verdict: "too bland, too weak, no real value, so esoteric no one knows
what it's talking about, zero engagement, people might even report us cuz only
bots/llm write garbage like this."

THE DEFECT WAS UPSTREAM OF THE COPY. All three are faithful renderings of the
fact packet they were handed, and the packet's lead fact was a pre-baked
abstraction minted by ``market_facts._growth_words`` / ``_inflation_words``.
So this suite pins both halves of the fix:

  * the PACKET now names the print (``market_facts`` §Named prints), and
  * the VALIDATOR refuses an abstraction that carries no print
    (``copywriter.anchorless_macro_violations``), wired at generation time AND
    at post time, because the queue is a bypass around every generation law.

Every negative fixture below is one of the three killed posts, verbatim.

Kept stdlib-only so it runs in the thin marketing-engine CI lane.
