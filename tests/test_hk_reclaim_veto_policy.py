"""The HK `reclaim_veto=False` admission policy (operator ruling 2026-08-03).

WHAT THIS PINS.  `engine.signal_quality._buy_filter` gained a keyword-only
``reclaim_veto`` flag.  Default True = the validated US/CN behaviour; HK passes False
(``scripts.build_hk_library.HK_RECLAIM_VETO``) to drop ONE leg — the requirement that a
name both below its 200-day average AND weekly-down close back above that average within
2 bars.

WHY THE LEG WENT.  It is unsatisfiable by construction for a deep drawdown: a name 17%
below its 200-day line cannot close above it inside two sessions, so every buy signal it
fires is auto-blocked until it has already recovered — i.e. until the move is over.  It
produced 68% of HK rejections and blocked 0700/9988/1810/3690/2318 into +8.7%..+44% runs.
Measured on the committed HK panel, flipping the flag turns 6 of the 9 witness July
markers from `block` to `take` at their original signal dates.

The tests below are deliberately built on SYNTHETIC series rather than the live panel:
the panel moves nightly, and a pin that drifts with the data cannot fail for the right
reason.  Each case constructs the exact branch it means to exercise.
