"""tests/test_marketing_reply_voice.py — E4 reply-craft acceptance suite.

Program: Content Studio LLM-first §10 E4 ("reply-craft intelligence").
Doctrine: research/MARKETING_REPLY_DOCTRINE_BY_FABLE.md, distilled from
research/marketing_dockets/reply_corpus_2026_07_29/ (180 top replies under 12
large finance posts, captured 2026-07-29).

Fixture-driven; ZERO live network, ZERO live LLM. Every provider-path test
monkeypatches engine.llm_auth.build_providers / make_call, and the arming env
flag is set through monkeypatch so it can never leak into another suite. Import
closure is stdlib + pyyaml — the thin marketing-engine CI lane has NO anthropic
package, so a top-level ``import anthropic`` in engine/marketing/reply_voice.py
would turn this file red at COLLECTION. Test 9 pins that mechanically.

The load-bearing tests are the negative ones. It is easy to write a phrasing
pass that ships model copy; the claims worth pinning are that a hallucinated
number CANNOT ship, that a failed gate costs phrasing and never the reply, that
a disarmed lane touches no provider at all, and that adding a critic did not
quietly weaken the queue's full-roster gate.

Covers:
  1. The doctrine file exists and still carries the taxonomy (drift guard).
  2. Prompt pins: ten exemplars verbatim with likes, the anti-exemplars, laws.
  3. The gates: numbers, advice/calls, length, links/hashtags/mentions/dashes,
     smuggled cashtags, the per-persona dial.
  4. The provider path: clean copy ships, dirty copy falls back, failures and
     raises fall back, the per-run cap falls back.
  5. Arming: disarmed touches nothing; armed-but-mute announces itself.
  6. The drafter hook: off by default, voiced when armed, alternates untouched.
  7. The reply_value critic, one test per anti-pattern class + its exemptions.
  8. Roster completeness: the queue accepts a full stamp and refuses one that
     is missing the new critic.
  9. Import closure + dependency direction.
 10. config/marketing.yml ships the voice block.

#: not", and pinning the pre-warmth string turned that into "the deterministic
#: draft is the one the warmth build replaced". Composing it here keeps the
#: assertion about the FALLBACK CONTRACT and lets the register evolve; the

#: THE ``thread_id`` IS LOAD-BEARING (added 2026-08-01, the tail build). The

#: ships and every fallback-contract test below fails on a sentence neither the
