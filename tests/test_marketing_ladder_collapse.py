"""W4a/W4b/W4c — the nightly ladder stops throwing away the day it publishes.

MASTERPLAN: research/X_GROWTH_SUPERINTELLIGENCE_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md §8.

WHAT WAS BROKEN (measured on the 2026-08-02 nightly, not inferred):

  * `plan_account(n_days=7, per_day=28)` booked a SEVEN-day ladder — 1,176 items
    across six enabled desks — while `outbox.emit_from_content_plan` takes only
    `D1-` slots and nothing reads a previous plan. 89% of every night's output
    was discarded by construction.
  * The cross-day cooldown pool was applied to the EMITTED day only, so an empty
    cooled pool dropped a D1 rung while the never-published days kept filling
    from the uncooled pool — the one day that ships was the only day that could
    starve.
  * Kelly has never posted once, ever. Her sole D1 item on 2026-08-02 was a
    `theme_list`, which `sentinel.ramp.weeks_1_2.theme_list_allowed: false` kills
    at plan-build. The planner spent her only at-bat on a banned format.
  * `report["dropped_cooldown"]` — the largest volume sink in the allocator —
    was written into a caller-supplied dict and never reached the plan `summary`.

WHAT IS NOT ALLOWED TO CHANGE, and is pinned below: an empty cooled pool still
DROPS the rung. It must never fall back to the uncooled pool, which would
publish exactly the repetition the cooldown exists to stop (masterplan §5.5).
