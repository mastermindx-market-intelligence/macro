"""tests/test_marketing_approval_desk.py — the autonomous approval desk.

WHAT THIS PINS. `engine/marketing/approval_desk.py` is the machine form of the
operator instruction "closely audit them, then approve them so they go out
quickly without me". It is the only path to live for the nine planned kinds:
`data/marketing/outbox/decisions.jsonl` (the designed operator-approve path)
has ZERO rows in repo history, so before this desk every planned post that ever
reached X was hand-transitioned by an agent session.

A gate with that much authority has to be pinned by OUTCOME, not by call count.
Every test below asserts the ledger status an item actually reaches and the
CHECK NAME recorded in its note, because the note is the operator's only handle
on "why did the desk do that".

Layout:
  1. behavioural matrix — one item per verdict class, `audit_item` only (pure)
  2. the sweep — `run()`: cap, kill switch, human decisions, dry-run
  3. publisher integration — a planned item goes queued → approved → dispatched
     in ONE sweep, while the breaking and mover lanes are untouched
  4. the Floor — every desk counter carries plain words and lands in the right
     ledger half
