"""tests/test_marketing_expression_dial.py — the expression dial + codex quirk pass (XG-W1).

Deps: stdlib + pytest + pyyaml only (runs in the ``marketing-engine`` CI lane,
which installs exactly that). No pandas, no numpy — engine/marketing/
expression_dial.py keeps stdlib + personas at module level, and a heavy top-level
import there must turn this suite red at collection. Nothing here is
``importorskip``-gated, so the suite cannot become a silent no-op.

Test list:
  1.  The dial map covers every known kind explicitly; nothing exceeds the ceiling.
  2.  CALIBRATION SET — the four pinned masterplan §5 dial-1 examples pass
      VERBATIM, and a dial-3 fixture is rejected.
  3.  The whitelist binds: one persona may not wear another's signature.
  4.  Dark canon is BANNED, and the loader refuses a spec that switches one on.
  5.  Frequency caps (per-post / per-day / per-7d / share-of-7d).
  6.  AM-R1 detectors fire, key off the pinned prose, and do not false-positive
      on the committed first-person example_lines.
  7.  apply_pass strips only what it may, and is a no-op off the dial.
  8.  DRY RUN — one item per employee through the real copy pipeline with the
      quirk pass ON, zero AM-R1 violations (the XG-W1 §0 acceptance gate).
  9.  Anti-vacuous tripwires: the index is non-empty, every marker is declared by
      someone, and the whole deterministic template bank is dial-clean.
