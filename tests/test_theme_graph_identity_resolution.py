"""V4-D2A — the GMI -> Data OS identity resolution bridge.

Contract: ``research/prophet_v4/d2/D2A_FROZEN_CONTRACT_2026-08-18.md``. This suite runs
the §6 hostile-case table VERBATIM against the REAL committed stores
(``data/theme_graph/{nodes,edges}.parquet`` + ``data/reference/{security_master,
vendor_aliases}.parquet``) — a planted-AAPL-only fixture would be insufficient (handoff
§14): the whole point of the bridge is what it says about the real, messy graph.

Mutation tests (§8) isolate the algorithm's mechanics from the real committed table's
redundant CURRENT-CATALOG rows (``store``/``yahoo_fetch``), which are unconditionally
open and would make almost any real, vendor-covered symbol resolve regardless of the
query date — so a genuine two-clock (dated-boundary) assertion needs a fixture table
carrying ONLY the historical vendor space under test.
