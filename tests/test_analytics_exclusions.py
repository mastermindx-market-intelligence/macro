"""Tests for admin/analytics_first_party.py — operator self-exclusion, table filtering,
and row caps (the pure, no-network parts).

The SQL is executed against the Supabase Management API in production; here we monkeypatch
`_query` to CAPTURE the generated SQL and assert on it, and monkeypatch `status` so the
`_guard` wrapper lets `run()` execute without a real PAT. No network is touched.
