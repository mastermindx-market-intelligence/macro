# a completed+success ci.yml run on a main DESCENDANT of the merge — executes
# ON the merged authority, so it is proof of main under the new gate, never the
# candidate-era evidence the fence forbids. These tests pin that E1 clears an
# authority-ONLY freeze, that a classified own-regression is never blanketed,
# that infrastructure ambiguity stays outside the path, and that the probe
# fails closed.
#
# The evidence is built by the REAL emitter (`reconcile_evidence`) and judged
# by the REAL gate (`semantic_gate_verdict`), never hand-shaped dicts: the
# emitter records the authority freeze itself as an
# `authority_self_excuse_refused` infrastructure row, so a hand-built
# "authority true, infrastructure empty" fixture is a shape it cannot produce —
# the first draft of these tests pinned exactly that unrealizable shape and
# therefore could not catch the predicate reading the wrong fields (pre-ship
# red team, 2026-08-19).

# be cleared by a descendant PASS, so it must never pin a session (PR #5936,
# 2026-08-19). Semantic eligibility is role-dependent — ci.yml plans the merge
# gate `--gate code` while `gate: data` jobs run on data-health.yml, which
# emits no main-role evidence at all — so a head planned before that split
# froze blocking units no main run will ever name again.
