"""Theme/sector SPOTLIGHT tilt — pure geometry + the dominance guarantees that keep it honest.

The contract these tests pin (the whole reason the tilt is safe to ship into the flagship
board): the spotlight RE-ORDERS names that already pass the risk gates, but it can never
(a) rescue an over-extended / cycle-blocked / AVOID name onto the buy list, (b) outrun the
macro / idiosyncratic risk taxes, or (c) inflate a position's suggested size.
