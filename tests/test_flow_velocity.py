"""Flow-velocity engine guards — the measure, not just its plumbing.

The desk shipped for weeks with a readout that was pinned by construction: velocity is a
drift-vs-ZERO t-stat, but neither source has a zero null (主力净占比 is structurally ~-2.5%,
southbound net is structurally positive), so the sector breadth gauge printed "broad outflow"
on 93.4% of days and "broad inflow" on 0 of 256, and southbound printed "accelerating in" on
96.6% of the last two years. Everything was green the whole time — there was no test that
looked at the *distribution* of the verdict, only at whether the panels rendered.

These tests are built to fail on that class of defect:
  · a null-drift series must score ~0 regardless of its structural offset (the actual bug)
  · a quiet stretch must not manufacture an extreme velocity (the leaderboard artifact)
  · truncated display lists must ship their true population counts (the "6 speeding up" lie)
  · the displayed rate must never contradict the velocity's sign on screen
