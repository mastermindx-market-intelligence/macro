"""tests/test_ontology_explorer_shell.py — F04-X1 public shell (RED first).

`site/ontology.html` and its paired assets are served publicly by Caddy. They are
the discoverable entry point, so they must be able to describe the product
without containing a single current owner reading — no inlined snapshot, no
bootstrapped JSON, no commented-out sample, no source map.

The failure this guards against is mundane and common: a builder that renders a
"realistic" example into the static shell so the page looks alive before the
fetch resolves. That example is a current premium value published to a public
host.
