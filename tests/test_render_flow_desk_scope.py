"""build_flow_desk must keep EXPRESS-LANE coverage — the #3515 freeze class.

FD-EXP (2026-07-30).  ``scripts/build_flow_desk.py`` builds site/flow_desk.html,
site/flow_desk.json and site/flowdata/cohorts.json.  It was wired in ``daily.yml``
ONLY, so those artifacts refreshed once a night while BOTH express lanes
(``render.yml`` on a push/dispatch, ``engine-render.yml`` on an ``engine/**`` push)
rebuilt the stores around them and committed the desk unchanged.  Identical class to
``build_flow_leaders`` (#3515) and ``build_research_vault`` (#3487): a page whose
builder lives in one lane while its inputs refresh in three.  An edit to the builder
or ``templates/flow_desk.html.j2`` sat unbaked until the next nightly.

ADMISSION PRECONDITION — the reason this builder was held out of the express lanes
while its options-family siblings went in: ``build()`` upserted committed ``data/``
parquets unconditionally.  #4007 closed that by gating all three write paths on
``COLLECT_LANE=nightly`` (HOUSE-U5).  :func:`test_the_admission_precondition_still_holds`
pins the gate, because deleting it would silently turn every express render back into
a ledger writer — the failure this admission depends on NOT happening.

ORDER matters twice: the desk reads ``site/flow/index.json``, which
``build_options_flow`` rewrites in the same band, so the desk must run AFTER it and
inside the same sequential cluster.
