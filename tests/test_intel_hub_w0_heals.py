"""Intelligence Hub — Wave 0 measurement-integrity heals + the policy-vote A7 heal.

Program: research/INTEL_HUB_LOBE_AUDIT_AND_UPGRADE_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md §4 / Appendix A.
One section per defect, each named with its register key:

  ITEM 1 (D13) — the policy desk's LLM-originated lean voted in BOTH scored aggregations
                 (net_confirm/agreement/conf_bonus → composite; lag_up → gap_mult →
                 opportunity). Operator ruling 2026-08-08 Option A: remove the vote, keep
                 the facet. DNR:KILL-LLM-ORIGINATION / constitution A7.
  ITEM 2 (D22) — snapshot rows carried no rank / cohort / hero-rejection provenance, so
                 "did Command win?" and "how often does the hero gate bar a #1 name?" were
                 unanswerable from 38 accrued nights.
  ITEM 3 (D2)  — the governor read data/radar/radar_ic.json, which engine-render never
                 commits, and degraded silently to identity trust on a stale/absent input.
  ITEM 4 (D21) — asof-or-BEFORE price reads were unbounded: a stalled series graded against
                 an arbitrarily old close on both legs of _fwd_rel.
  ITEM 5 (D20) — the ledger skipped 2026-08-04/07/08 with zero alarms while the page read
                 fresh, and 20d coverage sat at 6.2% printed nowhere.
  ITEM 6 (D3)  — special_situations.json could go days stale and the catalyst panel looked
                 identical.
  ITEM 7 (D4)  — the Quiver `twitter` dataset, dead since the 2023 X API shutdown, was still
                 listed as an active data lane.

Every ::warning added by this wave is asserted through capsys with a line-START check —
never caplog. GitHub only parses a workflow command when `::` is the first thing on the
line, and every builder here logs with a level-prefixing format, so an annotation routed
through a logger is silently dropped (tests/test_gh_annotation_line_start.py).
