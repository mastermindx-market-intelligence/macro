`_missing_required_media` could not enforce this: it keys on _CHART_BEARING_KINDS

    `_bare_cashtag_post` ran `_CASHTAG_RE.findall` unconditionally over EVERY
    kind, with no media entry required. So a macro read ending "…even $SPY is
    stretched" — for which no lane builds a chart and none ever will — was
    QUARANTINED. Terminal, on a post that owes nothing.

    That silently overrode the contract stated at `_TICKER_ROLLUP_KINDS`, in
    those words: "`macro`, `education`, `event`, `wire` and `breaking` are
    deliberately ABSENT. A breadth read may mention $SPY in passing; that is not
    a post about $SPY, and holding it for an upload strangles the desks'
    non-ticker voice for a rule written about rollups." `_missing_required_media`
    refused the same widening for the same reason — "THE KIND DECIDES, NOT THE
    TEXT" — and this gate now says it too.

    THE SPLIT: the kind decides only when NO card was ever built. An item whose
    lane DID draw a card and could not host it owes a picture whatever kind it
    claims to be, which is the hole TestTheTwoGatesHandOffWithoutAGap pins and
    which stays closed (every fixture there carries an unhosted media entry).
