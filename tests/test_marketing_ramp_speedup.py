"""tests/test_marketing_ramp_speedup.py — the D08 age ramp is an OPERATOR LEVER.

WHAT WENT WRONG (operator, 2026-08-03): "uhhh she should be posting. relax the
account age thingy and speed up its ramp up for new accs added."

Kelly's desk was created 2026-07-28 and had never posted once, ever. Her one and
only planned at-bat was a `theme_list`, which `sentinel.ramp.weeks_1_2.
theme_list_allowed: false` killed at plan-build (masterplan §8.1 V2). Relaxing
the schedule was not a config edit, though: the two tier boundaries were MODULE
CONSTANTS (`_RAMP_WEEKS_1_2_MAX_DAYS = 14`, `_RAMP_WEEKS_3_4_MAX_DAYS = 28`), and
`effective_graduate_after_days` clamped `graduate_after_days` up to the hardcoded
28 — so every configured graduation under 28 was silently INERT. A "we sped the
ramp up" config edit would have read as applied while every desk stayed on the
old schedule.

WHAT THIS SUITE PINS.

  1. The two boundaries are config-readable (`sentinel.ramp.weeks_1_2_days` /
     `weeks_3_4_days`) and actually move the tier a given age resolves to.
  2. On the SHIPPED config a 5-day-old desk is `weeks_3_4` (it was `weeks_1_2`)
     and a 10-day-old desk is `week_5_plus` (it was `weeks_1_2`).
  3. `graduate_after_days: 21` graduates at 21, not at the old clamp floor of 28.
  4. An INCOHERENT pair reverts BOTH boundaries to the code defaults and says so
     with a bare line-start `::warning` — asserted with capsys and
     `line.startswith("::")`, because a logger would prefix the line and GitHub
     would drop it (tests/test_gh_annotation_line_start.py).
  5. A config that names NEITHER key behaves byte-identically to the pre-2026-08-03
     14/28 schedule — the whole relaxation must be opt-in.
  6. Kelly can post, and `theme_list` is no longer banned for her at any age.

WHAT THIS SUITE IS NOT. The ramp is a PLATFORM-RISK throttle (a days-old account
must not post like a spambot), not a content-quality gate. Nothing here asserts
anything about `salience_threshold`, the near-dup Jaccard, the number budget, the
payload gate, tape freshness or the approval desk — those are the quality gates,
they live elsewhere, and the relaxation did not touch them.

DETERMINISM. `resolve_ramp_tier` takes `created`/`as_of` from plan inputs and must
never read a wall clock, so every age below is expressed as an OFFSET from a
fixed date. No test here reads `date.today()`.

CONVENTIONS. Reads the committed config only; no network, no writes.
