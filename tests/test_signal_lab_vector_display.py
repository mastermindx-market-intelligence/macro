"""Signal-Lab BTC Vector card: the DISPLAY hop of the promotion-stat chain.

``tests/test_btc_vector_w1.py`` pins ledger-vs-registry agreement (the trial
budget the calibrator charges == the dof_cost config.yml declares).  This file
pins the hop AFTER that one: what the Signal Lab page actually SHOWS must equal
what the calibrator computed.

That hop was unpinned and it drifted.  The card shipped "DSR 0.9945 (n=68 = 65
base + 3 override dof_cost)" while data/vector/calibration.json carried DSR
0.9661 at n=71 — the Override Registry had grown midterm_blackout to dof_cost=6
AND the headline DSR had moved onto the block-bootstrap T_eff basis.  Both moves
make the haircut HARSHER, so the published figure was optimistic against the
engine's own output: exactly the direction a promotion stat must never drift.

Run: python -m pytest tests/test_signal_lab_vector_display.py -q
