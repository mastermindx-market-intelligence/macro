"""W1 — flow vs selection on the ETF holdings snapshot pair.

A fund's snapshot pair carries two signals the shipped share-diff path collapses
into one: creation/redemption scales EVERY constituent by a common factor
(investor money arriving in the theme), and whatever a position does beyond that
factor is the manager's own decision. The board has only ever published the
second one — flow-normalized away — which is why a $500M week of creations into
a passive thematic fund reads as nothing at all.

WHAT THIS PINS.  The decomposition identity (flow + selection == the whole share
change, in shares, dollars AND pp of fund weight), the robustness guards that
stand between raw sponsor files and a published number, and the fact that none
of it moved `conviction_pp`. Each guard gets its own adversarial fixture, because
each one exists for a specific way a holdings feed lies:

  * a share SPLIT quadruples the share count with the position's dollar value
    unchanged — unguarded it prints as the manager buying 4× the stock;
  * a re-fetch written under a second filename repeats a day, which reads as a
    zero-change interval and breaks a streak that never broke;
  * sponsors report on different cadences, so raw deltas are not comparable
    across funds and staleness has to be measured against the fleet's own edge;
  * a snapshot whose weights sum to 40 is a broken parse, not a portfolio —
    decomposing against it invents a rebalance across every constituent;
  * a name absent from ONE file is a feed hiccup; calling that a full exit prints
    the strongest negative signal the board has on a parser blink.
