"""tests/test_us_board_grader_honesty.py — the US board grader's honesty set
(G1-G5 + B3, 2026-08-06).

Each defect below made the published number BETTER than the record supports, and each
is pinned here with its own falsifier — the mutation that would restore the old
behaviour must make the test red, or the test is only describing today's output.

  G1  precision@k scored the top-k OF THE GRADED SUBSET.  A published top name with
      no price promotes the row beneath it into the top-k: a ranking result produced
      by absence.
  G2  `_load_blob` read `.stdout` without checking the return code, so a failed
      `git show` read as "this revision had no board" and the history silently shrank.
  G3  `emit_ledger` excluded the pre-2026-06-25 broad-screen era and `build_track`
      pooled it — one file, two track records, over two different products.
  G4  the outcomes strip filled on the SIGNAL bar (unbuyable), marked every exited
      name at TODAY's close, and divided the win rate by running+stopped only.
  G5  `capture` admitted a NEGATIVE MFE, so realised/MFE on a pure loser is a ratio
      of two negatives: a −11.4% loss scored 2.51, above a perfect winner.
  B3  the featured extension veto fired only on a NUMERIC ext_z above the line, so a
      row with no reading passed it unopposed — 0 vetoes in 59 rows while all 10
      featured names carried ext_z None.

# ===========================================================================
# B3 → ANTICIPATION v1 — the featured extension veto fires on EVIDENCE only
#
# B3 (2026-08-06) made an unknown ``ext_z`` a featured veto, on the reasoning that a
# veto whose input is dark cannot be said to have passed.  That reasoning was right
# about the evidence and wrong about the remedy: the very next board proved it, with
# 69 of 69 buy rows carrying no reading (the equity close panel's newest row held 6 of
# 3,034 members and the pre-#4979 positional reader selected it) and a
# featured lane published as 0.  ANTICIPATION v1 (2026-08-08) keeps the veto for a
# KNOWN reading past the parabolic line and replaces the absence-veto with a
# disclosure: ``ext_unknown`` on the row, a coverage count on the block, and a
# ``::warning`` when the input is out on most of the board.  The score leg is
# unchanged — an unmeasured row still earns 0 runway, because fail-closed belongs to
# the POINTS.
