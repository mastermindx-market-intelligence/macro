"""Tests for packet B-A-F01-2 — the F01 credit/commodity data-plane wiring trace.

Pure-stdlib pytest: no network, no `gh`, no engine imports. Asserts the trace and
the DSC exist, that every source path it names still exists on disk, that every
file:line anchor is still in range, and that the trace is honest about what it did
and did not discharge — so the record fails loudly when the plane moves.
