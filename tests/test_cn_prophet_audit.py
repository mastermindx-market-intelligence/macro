"""China Prophet loser + miss telemetry (W0) and CN ledger hygiene (W1).

Three things are pinned here, and they fail for different reasons on purpose:

1. **THE FROZEN REPRODUCTION.** The whole W0 engine exists to answer "which of our
   picks lost, and did they share a shape". If the arithmetic behind that answer moves,
   every conclusion drawn from it moves with it. Section 1 recomputes the legacy era
   from the COMMITTED board store and the COMMITTED price stores and pins the audited
   numbers as inline constants: 584 episodes, 407 matured, 68.55% win, 128 losers, and
   a 31-episode chase cohort splitting 22 losers / 9 winners.

   The input grid is PINNED to ``REPRO_ASOF`` — every price series is truncated there
   before scoring. Without that the pin is a time bomb: 176 legacy episodes are still
   in flight, and each night of fresh bars matures more of them, so ``n_matured`` would
   climb away from 407 within days and the test would go red for the one reason that is
   not a regression. With the grid pinned, the only things that can move these numbers
   are a change to the scorer, a change to the chase definition, or a dividend
   re-adjustment that pushes a marginal episode across zero. The first two are exactly
   what this test is for; the third is rare, visible in the diff, and the correct
   response is to re-freeze the constants against a fresh audit — never to widen the
   tolerance until the test stops meaning anything.

2. **THE WRITE GATES.** The audit writes to ``data/`` from the nightly. Section 2 pins
   that it refuses on a non-asia lane and on a mid-session partial panel — the same two
   gates ``china_standout_track.append_board`` enforces — and that its forward log is
   keep-FIRST, so a re-run can never rewrite a headline a reader already saw.

3. **THE AUTHORITY BOUNDARY.** The audit is ops-telemetry with zero authority. Section
   3 pins that the board's buy rows survive the call byte-identical AND that the call
   site hands it nothing but ``asof``/``lane`` — the structural reason it cannot touch
   them. A behavioural check alone would pass vacuously if someone later handed the
   rows in and the mutation were subtle; the source pin is what makes it real.

Section 4 covers the W1 ledger hygiene: the skip counter that used to pool a genuine
survivorship hole with an in-flight episode, and the rank/tier lookup that labelled
every episode of a repeat ticker with its most recent appearance.

Section 7 covers the RANK EFFECTIVENESS block — the score grading itself. Two things
there deserve calling out, because they fail for opposite reasons:

  * **The orientation pins are the load-bearing half.** Every IC in the block shares one
    sign convention (lower ordering key = the board's better pick), which means a single
    missing negation in ``_order_key`` would invert every reading in the artifact while
    leaving every number plausible. The pins therefore drive a PERFECTLY ordered board
    and an exactly INVERTED one through both ordering sources and assert the signs from
    both ends, and separately assert that a cost metric's expected sign is the opposite
    of a return metric's.
  * **The calibration assert is what makes the block trustworthy at all.** A detector
    that has never been shown catching a known defect is not a detector. The legacy era
    is the defect the program already measured — board rank-IC +0.073 vs H=10 excess,
    anti-predictive — so the block is run over it on the SAME frozen grid section 1 uses
    and required to reproduce that number and raise its ``::warning``. If this test ever
    passes vacuously (empty store, wrong era, un-pinned grid), the whole block is
    unfalsifiable telemetry.
