"""tests/test_portfolio_changes.py — the W6 retention spine.

Covers engine/portfolio_changes.py (state digest + diff + "since your last visit"),
engine/portfolio_digest.py (the change-triggered email COMPOSER), and the
POST /api/portfolio/changes endpoint.

The load-bearing assertions here are the BOUNDARY ones, not the formatting ones:

  * TWO-ORGANISMS LAW — a state digest carries tickers and desk state and nothing else.
    No shares, no cost basis, no entry price, no weights, no user id. Asserted against a
    book whose rows carry all of those, so the test fails if any leaks through.
  * NO MAIL FROM A TEST OR A BUILD — engine/portfolio_digest.py imports no mailer and
    contains no send call, so importing it (here or in a build) cannot deliver anything.
    Asserted from the module's AST, not from a comment promising it.
  * FIRST VISIT IS NOT "EVERYTHING CHANGED" — an absent prior snapshot yields no changes
    and no email.
  * Advice-filter clean + "validated" absent, same bar as the brief composer.
