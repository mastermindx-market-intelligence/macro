"""A workflow step's ``run:`` script is LENGTH-CAPPED by GitHub — over it, the file
silently de-registers.

2026-07-27 (#3826 postmortem).  #3826 added ~1,010 characters of inline comment to
render.yml's big re-render step.  Every local gate passed — ``yaml.safe_load``,
``scripts/check_workflow_yaml.py`` (which only checks that the file loads and carries
``on:``/``jobs:``), AND ``actionlint`` 1.7.12, which models GitHub's workflow schema.
GitHub still refused the file:

* ``render.yml`` VANISHED from ``gh api repos/.../actions/workflows`` — only
  ``engine-render`` remained, so the express render lane simply stopped existing;
* every push to EVERY branch carrying the file got a zero-job FAILED run titled by
  PATH (``.github/workflows/render.yml``) instead of by ``name:`` (``render``).  That
  path-vs-name title is the signature to look for — it is the same shape as the
  metabolism-agenda col-0 incident (#2135 → #2260).

The express render lane was dead on main for ~40 minutes before anyone could see it,
because the PR's own checks were all green: this failure mode is invisible to
``gh pr checks``.  It only shows up in the BRANCH run list.

The cause is SIZE, not content, established by bisection against GitHub itself:

===================================================  =============  ==========
run: scalar                                          chars          GitHub
===================================================  =============  ==========
without the comment block                            20,563         accepted
with the comment block                               21,573         REFUSED
with equal-length plain-ASCII filler instead         21,590         REFUSED
===================================================  =============  ==========

The exact cliff between 20,563 and 21,573 was never probed (each probe costs a real
push and main was down), so this guard pins the CONSERVATIVE end: no step's ``run:``
may exceed the largest length GitHub has actually been observed to accept.

The outage itself was ended by a parallel session: #3834 split a `public-render` lane
out of render.yml, which dropped that step to ~17k and made the file parseable again
(a run titled ``render`` reappeared on main at 21:51Z).  So the shrink was incidental
— nobody involved knew about the cap.  That is exactly why this guard exists: without
it the next comment block re-arms the same trap, silently.

The fix when a step trips this: prose belongs in YAML comments ABOVE the step, which
the parser strips and which therefore cost the scalar nothing.  Do NOT "fix" it by
deleting the reasoning — move it.

Live headroom when this landed (2026-07-27): engine-render.yml's re-render step is at
20,220 chars — 343 from the observed-accepted watermark.  One added comment there
takes out the engine express lane the same way.
