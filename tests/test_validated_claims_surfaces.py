"""BC-2: the three enforcement gaps the 2026-07-29 dislocation-panel audit found.

GAP 1 — `surfaces` was decorative. Every allowlist entry has carried a `surfaces` list
naming the page/study its justification was written for, and the matcher never read it.
Matching was phrase-scoped only, so an affirmative claim on ANY page passed as long as
its wording matched an entry justified for a DIFFERENT page. Live case: the dashboard's
dislocation panel said "the validated gate governs" / "the validated Fed-put gate
governs" and rode entries backed by the sector_central absolute-trend gate and the
spvector re-deploy overlay — two studies that say nothing about the Fed-put master
switch. The panel's real backing (research/DISLOCATION_VALIDATION.md) was never named,
which is exactly the traceability BC-2 exists to force.

GAP 2 — the zh token list was '已验证' only. The script's own header flagged 经验证
("having been validated") as a KNOWN GAP; the dislocation panel's zh copy
以经验证的一道闸为准 (engine/dislocation.py) was therefore not gated at all while its EN
twin was. 经过验证 had the same hole (gex.html), and 已经验证 is covered through 经验证.

GAP 3 — a hyphen was read as a CSS selector. The structural skip for selector / DOM
identifier tokens was written `[.\\-]validated\\b` — "a dot OR A HYPHEN before the token".
A hyphen before the token is also how English writes an adjective, so
"backtest-validated", "Holdout-validated", "FDR-validated", "drawdown-validated" all
matched it; and because a _STRUCTURAL hit kills the WHOLE LINE, those claims were
invisible to BC-2 — no allowlist entry, no CI failure, no trace. 21 lines reached the gate
only through that rule: 7 genuine selectors and 14 carrying prose claims. The rule now
requires a DOT-PREFIXED identifier (_IDENT_MASK) and MASKS that identifier in place
instead of killing its line, so copy sharing a line with a selector is still gated.

All three are pinned here through the REAL gate (scan_text / scan_python_copy / _scan_line
+ the live allowlist), never a substring match, so negation, structural and surface
semantics stay in one place.
