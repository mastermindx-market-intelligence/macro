"""tests/test_wires_rail_b4b.py — XG-W7 / D05-B4b+B4c+seeding.

What this pins:

  B4c  daemon ZH pass  — _attach_zh fills a Chinese twin for NEW items only, is
                         disarmable, and FAILS SOFT in every direction (raising
                         translator, None entries, echoed English). The rail must
                         degrade to honest English-plus-marker, never to a blank.
  B4b  news.html rail  — the panel consumes the real wires.v1 contract, renders
                         the engine's plain-word labels instead of the machine
                         `class` slug, and keeps the four HTTP outcomes apart
                         (404 hidden / 401-403 gate / error down / empty quiet).
  seed follow-CTAs     — handles reach marketing mail and the report footer, and
                         are kept OUT of transactional mail and out of the shared
                         public footer (which is IA-locked to the landing and
                         host-locked by the China-access guard in
                         tests/test_support_page.py).
