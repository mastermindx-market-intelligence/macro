Small unit tests on the candidate MATH PRIMITIVES only — not a re-run of the full
history replay (that lives in the committed report, off the render path). Each test
name maps to one candidate definition or cross-cutting property named in the build
commission:

  M1 winsorization bounds   causal rolling clip actually bounds the output

  M3 probit mapping         norm_ppf matches known standard-normal quantiles and is
                             monotonic in the input rank
  floor application         the 0.25x expanding-std floor actually lifts a collapsed

    above-norm reach across the held-out window'). With every candidate excluded, the
    frozen fallback applies: tau=0.5 stays numerically unchanged from before W5.

    R2 note: R1 framed this as 'the incumbent stays even though the METHOD switched to
    M1' — but R2's independent review separately found that applying the <2%
    held-out-reach exclusion to the M1 grid ALONE (never checking M0) was itself a
    post-hoc, challenger-only application of the bound, WITHDRAWN as a prereg breach. R2
    reverted the method to M0 outright, so tau=0.5 is retained by the frozen tie-break
