"""Every authenticated/product page header comes from ONE source.

Companion to tests/test_public_chrome.py, which guards the *anonymous* family
(_public_nav.html.j2 + the hand-authored landing). This module guards the
*product* family: templates/_site_nav.html.j2.

WHY THIS EXISTS (operator report 2026-08-01, "many of our pages have different
menus... super confusing and ruins UX"):

_navlinks.html.j2 was introduced to stop the menu drifting, but by design it
shared only the LINK LIST — its own header says "the surrounding chrome (the
<nav> wrapper, the search box, the theme/lang controls) stays per-page". So 59
templates each kept a hand-copied right-hand chrome, frozen at whatever date
that page was last edited. A census of the 235 built product pages found
**12 distinct headers**: 5 pages carried a theme-rotation bell, 10 an "AI Daily
Brief" button, 39 a Mastermind pill that 161 others lacked, 2 had no controls at
all, and 14 had no search box.

The fix moved the WHOLE header into _site_nav.html.j2. These tests keep it there.

DESIGN NOTE — these pins are STRUCTURAL, not a banned-word list. The load-bearing
assertion is that the `nav-ctrls` *container* may be authored exactly once; that
catches any new control anyone invents, whereas a list of the four slugs removed
in 2026-08 would only ever re-pin that one postmortem.

SCOPE NOTE — these tests read templates/ only, never site/. A template-only PR
does not re-render site/, so any assertion that a built page matches its
template is unsatisfiable until the render lane runs.
