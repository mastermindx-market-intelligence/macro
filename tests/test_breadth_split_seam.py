"""Split-seam repair guard for the breadth close caches (BreadthAdapter._merge_refreshed).

yfinance auto_adjust back-adjusts only the freshly downloaded window, so the
tail refresh (fresh 1mo combine_first cached) leaves cached pre-window rows on
the pre-split basis after a stock split. Observed 2026-07-10 in the live S&P
500 cache: KLAC $1,842.80 -> $180.90 across 2026-05-11/12 (fake -90.2% day from
the 10:1 split of 2026-06-12; the seam sits where the 1mo window stopped
rewriting), plus CRWD 4:1 and a DD re-basing. Poisons pct_above_50/200, 252d
NH/NL, adv/dec and the OHLCV extras caches until the lookback rolls past.

Pure-function tests (no network): the yfinance downloader is monkeypatched.
