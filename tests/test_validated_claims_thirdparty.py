"""BC-2: quoted third-party research is a structural non-claim — and nothing more.

The research vault mirrors syndicated institutional notes verbatim on the nightly render
path, so 'validated' arrives in its ordinary English sense ("the June CPI print validated
two likely sources of ongoing disinflation") with no artifact to cite. Before #3768 that
reddened check_validated_claims on main and blocked every open PR from ci-pack-0 until
someone hand-wrote an allowlist entry — an entry the allowlist's own purpose calls "a claim
of record", which a third-party quote is not ours to make.

scripts/check_validated_claims.py now masks the third-party TEXT SINKS of the three
syndicated render targets. These tests exist to pin that the exemption is a SINK exemption,
not a path exemption: for every shape where a quote passes, the same page carrying OUR OWN
affirmative claim must still fail. If someone widens the skip to "site/research/ is exempt",
the paired platform-authored case here goes green and this file fails.

Covers the four ways the skip could be wrong:
  1. too narrow — a real sink left unmapped (the recurrence returns)
  2. too wide  — our own copy on the same page silently exempted
  3. forgeable — the exemption obtainable without the builder's attestation
  4. leaky     — a malformed page exempting everything after its last opener

# providing. Until 2026-08-07 that was pinned by naming the note that reddened main on
# 2026-07-26 (site/research/us-daily-what-the-rebound-in-oil-prices-…-3da181.html) and
# asserting its quote was masked. The page is still rendered and still mapped, but the quote
# is gone and NOTHING about the gate changed: the hourly ingest's excerpt snapshot
# (data/research_vault/excerpts.json) dropped from 912 entries to 2 at 2026-08-07T05:39Z, so
# the re-render that followed emitted no <div class="rr-x-body"> on ~905 report pages — the
# sink that quote lived in. The assertion did exactly its job: it refused to report "covered"
# for a page that had gone green because its text rotated away.
#
# The property is now pinned on both sides so neither half can go quiet:
#   * on IN-REPO fixture bytes, which cannot rotate — always runs;
#   * on the live tree, following _THIRD_PARTY_PAGES (the gate's own map) instead of a
#     filename, so a newly mapped render target is swept the day it is added.
# Both use the same control: strip the attestation — the only thing that earns the skip —
# and the very same bytes must fire. That is strictly stronger than counting the mask,
# because it proves WHAT greened the page rather than that something was excised.
