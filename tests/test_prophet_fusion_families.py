"""The evidence-family registry is enforced by this file, not by prose.

WHAT IS PINNED.  `research/prophet_fusion/families.yml` is the LAW for the Prophet US
Conditional Intelligence Fusion arena (masterplan §5.1/§5.2; PIT verdicts §4.1/§4.2;
staleness/abstention §7 O6; PIT join law §9.1).  The masterplan's §5.1 table is its prose
view.  Every claim below exists because prose alone has already failed at least once
somewhere in this estate:

  * ONE-COLUMN-ONE-FAMILY.  Families are the unit of anti-double-count budgeting at every
    arena rung C1-C5 (§10.6).  A column living in two families is a free second vote, which
    is exactly the failure the family construct exists to prevent — so uniqueness is a test
    over the file, never a rule in a document.  The four single-home RULINGS (`ext_z`->F2,
    relay->F3, theme heat->F3, turnover->F5) are additionally pinned BY NAME, because a
    generic uniqueness test passes just as happily after someone moves `ext_z` to F8.

  * NO PHANTOM COLUMNS.  A registry that names a column the store does not have is worse
    than an incomplete one: the harness silently reads nothing and the family scores a
    clean null.  Every `columns:` entry of a wired member must exist in the candidates
    store's real parquet schema.

  * ANTI-AUTHORITY-CREEP.  The `authority:` block is all-false and must stay all-false.
    This artifact ranks nothing, sizes nothing, gates nothing, originates nothing,
    escalates nothing.  Flipping a boolean here is a doctrine amendment, not a refactor.

  * PIT STATUS IS LOAD-BEARING.  `snapshot_not_pit` / `forward_only` members are
    HARD-REFUSED in backtest frames (§4.2).  `pit_settlement` is admitted after #5705
    (8th NYSE session, not settlement+10 calendar days) but is still not estimable.
    If the registry stops marking snapshot members, a backtest reads today's snapshot
    into 2026-06 rows and the leakage is invisible — it looks like signal.
