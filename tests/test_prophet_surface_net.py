"""Prophet US permanence net — PR-1 (ROUTE: build, 2026-08-27 commission).

August 2026: the US Prophet Live 5-minute lane went dark 27 days with every
process signal green; boards were fresh while a mislabeled UI date read as
stale; the one instrument naming the board's exact path was warn-only exit-0;
pages routed to a dedup-gated webhook; prophet-outage issues sat unread five
days. An opus red-team of the first design found the fix had to be small,
ADDITIVE extensions of the existing instruments (scripts/freshness_sentinel.py,
scripts/check_nightly_liveness.py, scripts/prophet_rescue.py) plus one new
post-publish alarm (scripts/prophet_board_acceptance.py) — never a parallel
JSON-registry design.

This module pins the mechanism-agnostic coverage contract (the templates name
the artifacts a reader actually consumes; at least one grader must name each
one), the shared intake-identity predicate every instrument duplicates, the
acceptance script's own behaviors, the check_nightly_liveness lane-latch
acceptance exemption, and the freshness_sentinel heartbeat write/grade round
trip (plus its served-vs-R2 agreement check, R2 mocked).

NOT pinned here (see research/PROPHET_US_PERMANENCE_NET_2026-08-27.md §0 and
the commissioning packet's GAPS): the escalation ladder ([DAY N] title +
distinct alert type per day-level) and the self-withdraw cancel — both
withheld from this PR (see that masterplan and DEC-PROPHET-US-PERMANENCE-NET
for the specific conflicts that stopped them).
