"""Executable guards for the TOP ANATOMY W1 surface design freeze.

Authored (PR #5267) while the template was still INERT — no builder, no nav row,
no pipeline slot — so the guards below render it through a standalone Jinja
environment of the test's own making. That standalone render is still the freeze
and is kept verbatim: the design must survive on its own terms, independent of
whatever wires it.

The surface is no longer inert. `scripts/build_winner_health_page.py` renders it
from `data/top_maturation/latest.json`, `templates/_navlinks.html.j2` carries its
row, and `config/dag.yml` / `.github/workflows/daily.yml` schedule it (their
parity is `tests/test_dag_conformance.py`'s job, not this file's). A freeze that
only ever ran in a harness the production path does not use would be a freeze on
nobody's page, so the same two invariants are re-asserted through the real
builder below, and the wiring itself is pinned so the surface cannot silently go
dark again.
