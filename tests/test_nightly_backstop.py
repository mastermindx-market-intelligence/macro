"""Pins the nightly backstop's dispatch rule.

The dangerous direction here is the opposite of a detector's. A detector that is
wrong raises a false alarm; an ACTOR that is wrong fires a production pipeline —
possibly on top of a live one, which is exactly the 2026-08-09 ci.yml livelock
where each re-dispatch killed the proof the whole fleet was waiting on. So most of
this suite is about the cases where it must do NOTHING.

Fixture dates are constants with no relation to the wall clock.
