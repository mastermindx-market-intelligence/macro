"""tests/test_prophet_origination_disclosure.py — the reconstructed-plan disclosure.

research/PROPHET_OUTAGE_BACKFILL_2026_08.md §0.10 (plain-word bilingual disclosure) and
§0.6c (the record must let a reader SPLIT the cohort).

WHAT IS ACTUALLY BEING DEFENDED. The operator's force-majeure replay mints US Prophet
plans stamped ``origination_mode: "outage_backfill_2026_08_09"``. Those rows must tell a
reader — in EN and in ZH, in plain words — that the pick was rebuilt after an outage
rather than originated live, and must never say so in the internal vocabulary of the
event ("backfill", "mixed vintage", "force majeure", the era literal, the mode slug).

THE SAFETY PROPERTY THIS SUITE EXISTS FOR. Zero such rows exist today. Every key in this
feature is ABSENT rather than zero/null when nothing was reconstructed, so shipping it is
a no-op: ``test_the_shelf_is_byte_identical_when_nothing_was_reconstructed`` pins the
rendered page character-for-character against the same page built without the feature's
context key at all. If that test ever fails, this PR started changing today's site.

BROWSER-FREE, like its sibling test_prophet_whynot_receipts.py and for the same reason:
the CI packs install a minimal dependency set, so an importorskip("playwright") here
would SKIP in CI and report green while proving nothing. The design measurements that
need a browser (both themes, both languages, the two adjacent dotted receipts) were made
against a synthetic 2-reconstructed + 2-live index and are attached to the PR.
