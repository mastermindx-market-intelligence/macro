"""Wave B workflow structure: `ci-plan` plans once, `ci-pack` executes it, `ci-gate` adjudicates.

WHAT CHANGED AND WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS.  Until 2026-08-11 `ci.yml` carried one job
with a literal `matrix: pack: [0..11]`, and all twelve packs re-derived the same
selection independently.  The matrix is now emitted by a new `ci-plan` job, which
means two properties that used to be structurally impossible are now merely
conventional — and a convention in a 4,000-line YAML file is not a guard:

  * A PR may publish a SUBSET of `ci-pack-0..11`, so "all twelve are green" is no
    longer a question anything downstream can ask.  `ci-gate` is the one name that
    concludes on every proof-producing event, and `scripts/merge_on_green.py` requires an
    AFFIRMATIVE success on the head — absence of red is not a pass (#4779).  Delete
    `ci-gate`, or let its no-work branch rot, and a proven-no-work PR reads
    `unproven` and never merges.  Nothing about that failure is visible in a diff.
  * The plan is computed from a diff, so WHICH commit it diffs against is now
    load-bearing. The tested base is parent 1 of the exact synthetic merge commit;
    parent 2 must equal the signed event head. Every branch NAME
    (`github.head_ref`, `github.base_ref`, `github.ref_name`) resolves at run time,
    while event base metadata can be stale by runner pickup. Substituting either
    would let the plan describe a different diff than the tested merge tree.

The `ci-gate` tests EXECUTE the adjudication script under `bash` rather than reading
it, because the whole point of that job is its exit code.  A test that only greps for
the string `exit 1` passes just as happily when the branch above it returns early.

        An error occurred trying to start process '/usr/bin/bash' ...
        Argument list too long

    The planner had diffed against the PR's opening base SHA while main moved 45
    commits / 8,581 paths underneath it, attributed the whole drift to the PR,
    and rode the resulting list into the pack step's `env:` through a job
    output: 350,264 bytes against execve's 131,072-byte MAX_ARG_STRLEN.

    Two names are therefore forbidden in this file outright. `env:` and
    `$GITHUB_ENV` are the same hazard — both end up in a later process's
    environment — so "it is only an env var, not a command line" is not a
    defence: execve counts them together. What IS allowed to cross is a PATH.
