"""tests/test_capability_health.py — F13 V1 acceptance suite (capability health).

FIXTURE ROOTS ONLY, mirroring tests/test_output_health.py's own law: nothing here
asserts on the live ``config/capability_health.yml`` content or on the live estate's
health. Every scenario is built in memory. The 8 fixtures named (a)-(h) in the F13
commission are the ``test_fixture_*`` functions below, in the same order the commission
lists them.

REPAIR 2026-09-04 (independent Opus review, CONFIRMED by the F13 principal): this suite
was rewritten to pin the exact production mutants the review found —
  C1 — a lane fact with last_attempted but NO last_successful must never anchor healthy.
  C2 — last_attempted/last_successful must never be cross-source unioned before
       adjudication (source A's attempt vs source B's success).
  I3 — an unreadable source can never be masked by a healthy-reading sibling.
  I2/I4 — an unparseable or future-dated clock value is a CORRUPT receipt, not an absent
          one, and never reads fresh.
  M1 — a non-healthy record never renders its summary ``reason`` as "ok".
  M3 — an unrecognized state defaults to the WORST rank in a worst-of fold.
Fixture (a) now covers BOTH the "present but old success" shape and the C1 production
mutant (absent last_successful entirely); (b) adds a multi-source variant; (c) pins the
degraded/stale boundary with paired same-source clocks; (e) asserts STATE is capped at
degraded, not just that a reason is present.
