"""Agent OS Phase 3 — `agentos.py compile-context`.

A context bundle is TESTIMONY: a session acts on it without opening the sources.  So the
properties worth pinning are the ones that make it trustworthy rather than merely
plausible, and every one of them is asserted against a NEGATIVE fixture — an exclusion
rule with nothing to exclude is untested, and reads identically to no rule at all.

* **Every line is cited.**  On the real seeded store, every item in every section carries
  a `path` and a `why_included`.  An uncited line is a claim the reader cannot check.
* **Exclusion is by FIELD and is NAMED.**  A superseded decision, an expired discovery,
  an uncited-and-stale discovery, an older handoff and a malformed record each land in
  `excluded` with the specific reason — never silently absent, never co-equal in a
  section.
* **The boundary is structural.**  Records belonging to another program cannot appear at
  all: search hits only VOTE for a workstream, and content comes from the graph walk.
* **The cap is honest, and it never costs a constraint.**  When the budget binds,
  `omitted_due_to_budget` is a LIST with token costs, and the bundle still fits.  A silent
  truncation reads exactly like a smaller store.  HIGHER LAW is exempt from the cap
  alongside the workstream block: a bundle that spent its last tokens on file pointers
  while dropping the rows a session may not violate is worse than one that overran.
* **I4, both directions.**  Naming an unknown or malformed workstream exits 1
  (fail-CLOSED on schema); a missing sibling repo, a missing active_builds.json and a
  missing index all exit 0 with `degraded` populated (fail-OPEN on join).
* **I1 and read-only.**  Nothing here can gate anything, and the store is byte-identical
  after a run.
