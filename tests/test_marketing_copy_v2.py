"""tests/test_marketing_copy_v2.py — Content Studio W1 writer/critic acceptance.

Program: ``research/MARKETING_CONTENT_STUDIO_LLM_FIRST_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md``
§0 gates 1-6, pinned by
``research/marketing_dockets/CONTENT_STUDIO_W1_BUILD_CONTRACT.md`` §Tests (A).

EVERY DEFECT CLASS THE OPERATOR NAMED GETS A NAMED TEST, AND EVERY NEGATIVE
FIXTURE IS A REAL STRING FROM THE REJECTED 2026-07-29 BATCH. That is the point
of this file: the batch was quarantined, and a quarantined batch teaches nothing
unless its exact sentences are the ones the gates are proven against.

    "Entry 285.10, target 375.91"                          -> fake precision
    "Historical, not a promise."                           -> orphan hedge
    "18 groups on the move today"                          -> no denominator
    "That sets the tone for everything else on the screen"  -> internal jargon
    "Win or lose it gets graded"                           -> internal jargon

Fixture-driven; ZERO live network, ZERO live LLM. Every provider-path test hands
``engine.llm_auth.build_providers`` a fake provider whose client is a local
object, so the REAL waterfall and the REAL request builder run and only the
transport is fake. The env flag is set through monkeypatch so it can never leak
into another suite. Import closure is stdlib + pyyaml: the thin marketing-engine
CI lane has NO anthropic package, so a top-level ``import anthropic`` in
copywriter.py or copy_critic.py would turn this file red at COLLECTION. Tests 30
and 31 pin that mechanically as well.

Covers:
  1-4.   Rounding table + whitelist display forms + full precision kept aside.
  5-7.   Fake precision (gate 3d) on the real "Entry 285.10, target 375.91".
  8-10.  Orphan hedge (gate 3e) on the real "Historical, not a promise."
  11-13. Count without denominator (gate 3f) on "18 groups on the move today".
  14-16. Internal jargon (gate 3f): screen / board / graded.
  17-18. Sibling 6-gram divergence (gate 3b).
  19-24. Shape conformance (gate 3g) incl. headline outside two_part.
  25.    Batch opener collision (gate 3i).
  26.    Per-item isolation: 1 poisoned item in 10 -> 9 posts (gate 2).
  27-29. Critic flow: pass, reject->repair->pass, reject->repair->drop (gate 5).
  30-31. Import closure + no-fallback law.
  32-35. Prompt pins: shapes, corpus exemplars, anti-exemplars, rounding law.
  36-39. market_facts denominators + the jargon-free source scan.
  40.    The dry run imports and refuses to write.
  46-51. The 2026-07-31 PROMPT AUTOPSY, one class per defect. These read the
         PROMPT, not a post: the finding was that the system prompt fights
         itself, and no amount of output-side testing can see that.
           46. The prompt never prescribes a phrase its own validators kill.
           47. Per-shape number budgets the contracts and the validator agree on.
           48. Every payload key is named in the prompt (AST introspection).
           49. The persona card rides the system prompt and outranks the
               house VOICE defaults inside its declared caps.
           50. Invented levels: a target the fact packet never carried.
           51. Repeated closers across the 7-day history, not just the batch.
