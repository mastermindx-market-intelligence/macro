"""tests/test_prophet_w1_intake_repair.py — Prophet US W1 plan-intake repair.

Three changes, each pinned separately
(research/PROPHET_US_TREND_INTELLIGENCE_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md §5 W1):

  1. ORDER — `select_candidates` ranks by the us_prophet_v1 priority score
     (`row["prophet"]["score"]`, engine/us_board_rank.py #4331) instead of raw
     `conviction.score`.  This is a SCORED change; it cites the Grade-A
     "Primary sort key" ruling in research/US_BOARD_MEASUREMENT.md (retro board/
     conviction order P@1 0.20 vs alpha-order 0.60).  Rows with no numeric
     priority score fall back to the OLD key, below every scored row.

  2. BLOCK — an OPEN plan on the same ticker+direction blocks re-origination.
     The plan id carries signal_date, so a fresh signal used to originate a
     SECOND plan for a name that was already live (10 ticker+direction pairs
     held duplicate open plans on 2026-08-03; PI held three).

  3. INDEX HYGIENE — every shipped plan carries `age_days` + a plain-word
     `pulse`/`pulse_zh`, and the index carries `active_count_by_age`.  Additive
     only: no plan is removed or re-ordered (population fence G0.4).

THE POPULATION FENCE, AND WHAT SUPERSEDED IT (ANTICIPATION A1, 2026-08-08)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
W1's "ordering only" claim was that the ADMITTED population — the rows clearing
the band / act_level / score / dir / entry_signal gates — is byte-identical to
the pre-W1 rule.  `_old_select` below is that rule, copied verbatim, and it used
to be asserted against the LIVE `select_candidates`.

ANTICIPATION §6.2 A1 deliberately moved the population: admission is now a STATUS
CLASS (patience = bounce_wait/wait_pullback/hold, confirmation = buy_now/partial)
and the act-level gate is gone.  The W1 fence is therefore re-pointed rather than
deleted — `_old_select` is now asserted against `engine.prophet_bridge.legacy_admitted`,
the frozen copy of the same rule that keeps feeding the zero-authority shadow
ledger, so W1's guarantee is still pinned against the thing that still makes it.
`TestA1MovedThePopulationDeliberately` pins the move itself, so a silent
regression back to the act-level gate fails here too.

Everything else in this file — the priority-score ordering, the legacy fallback,
the re-origination block, index hygiene — is untouched by A1 and still live.

The uncapped half of W1's own repair (P4, then #5071's lossless origination) is
also untouched: live `originate_plans` requests the uncapped population and
originates every surviving row, so the 12-row helper sample below is a research
slice and never an opportunity gate.

# "Verbatim" was FALSE for the tier_cascade clause below, and silently so from
# #5071 (which added it to `select_candidates`) through #5105 (which re-pointed
# this copy at `legacy_admitted` without porting it).  Two rules that differ by
# a filter nothing on the board can trip are indistinguishable from two rules
# that agree, so the fence read green for two PRs and detonated the night the
# first discriminating row arrived: `us_standouts.json` as_of 2026-08-12 carries
# SWX at `signal.tier_cascade == "T4"` -- the first non-T1/T2/T3 buy row ever
# published (histogram that night: T1 35, T2 28, T4 1, absent 8).  The engine was
# right and stayed right; this copy admitted 24 rows where the frozen rule admits
# 23, and `test_committed_artifact_admits_the_identical_rows` correctly said so.
#
# The clause is part of the rule being copied, not an implementation detail: it
# predates the freeze (pre-A1 `select_candidates` carried it with the comment
# "actionable contract has always been T1-T3 (signal_gate.BUYABLE_TIERS)") and
# `legacy_admitted`'s own docstring names it. Restoring it makes the transcription
# true rather than loosening what the fence asserts.
#
# #5524 restored the clause but left the fence's BLIND SPOT intact: it was a no-op
# on every synthetic fixture here (`_buy()` emitted no `signal` block at all), so
# the only call sites that could move were the two reading the committed artifact,
# and the only reason those moved was that one nightly happened to publish SWX at
# T4.  A board without such a row -- every board before 2026-08-12 -- restores the
# original silence.  `_buy(tier_cascade=...)` and
# `test_tier_cascade_leg_admits_identically` now pin the leg on rows this file
# owns, so the next transcription drift reds on a fixture instead of waiting for
# the tape to expose it.
