"""china_heatmap.html — the W2 anonymous tier-preview conversion.

This page is the odd one out among the converted desks. Special Situations was
already split and W1a moved only its access class; etfs.html was fully
server-rendered and its PR had to take the graded rows off the URL. The heatmap
shipped **zero content**: a 76-line shell that built every tile, stat and mover
in the browser from ``marketdata/<market>_heatmap.json``. Flipping the boundary
alone would therefore have replaced a 302 with a *thin-content 200* — a worse
outcome, because Google keeps it and rates it thin.

So the conversion is a CONTENT build, and this module guards both halves:

* the **SSR summary layer** (market pulse, breadth stat cards, sector ladder,
  both mover boards) is present, non-empty and market-correct for all THREE
  markets — the twins are the likeliest silent casualty of a China-only fix;
* the **gate** is one note, one CTA row and one micro-wall inside the hover
  card, with no ``.tier-wall``, because a wall over content that is free would
  be a lie;
* the hover card has **two distinct empty states** — "no nightly read yet" is
  true on an entitled build with a missing file and a lie on a walled one, and
  neither is inferred from the fetch result alone;
* the boundary opened the page and the tile map and **nothing else**.

Runs in the `unrun-page-guards` CI job (full venv: the engine imports pandas).
The Caddy↔policy byte-equality half is pinned by tests/test_site_access_boundary.py
and the wall mirror by tests/test_regwall.py, both in `tier-gate`.
