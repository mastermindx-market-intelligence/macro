"""Defect 4 (operator, live posts 2026-08-03): the canned directional stance.

THE POST
--------
    $FSLR, biggest move in the index today

    FSLR surged +10.3% today (Technology). Real strength or real damage,
    either way I'd let it settle first.

The operator: "this just did a daily MACD cross and is washed out after 2 months
of downtrend... If it launched then the best thing to do is to chase in, since it
already got washed. So us saying to let it settle is the dumbest thing ever and
just ruins our reputation."

THE RULING BEING PINNED
-----------------------
The defect is not that the stance pointed the wrong way. It is that the lane
emitted a DIRECTIONAL TRADING STANCE IT HAD NEVER COMPUTED: the sentence came out
of a template bank indexed by a sha256 of ticker|account|slot, and no part of
that hash has ever read a chart. A template that says "let it settle" over every
large move is wrong about half the time by construction.

So: we do not issue a directional trading stance we have not computed. Two shapes
remain lawful, and every assertion below pins one of them:

  (a) NO STANCE — the move, an honest admission of what the desk has not done,
      and stop.
  (b) A COMPUTED stance — the real technical state the move landed in, read off
      the name's own daily bars (movers_source.technical_state).

WHAT EACH TEST PINS
-------------------
  test_detector_fires_on_every_stance_that_actually_shipped
      Non-vacuity. The detector is walked over the verbatim copy that went live
      (and over the whole retired bank). A guard that cannot see the defect it
      was written for is decoration; this is the mutation check for the two
      halves that matter — remove any single named pattern in
      copywriter.uncomputed_stance and a line here goes MISS.
  test_detector_stays_quiet_on_lawful_copy
      The other half of the same check: a shape rule that fires on everything
      would pass the bank walk by deleting the product.
  test_mover_and_theme_banks_carry_no_trading_instruction
      THE ENFORCEMENT SWEEP. Enumerates every mover / theme_list template, both
      tail pools, and both voice fillers, and fails on any line matching the
      instruct-the-reader shape. This is what a future "better line" trips.
  test_every_theme_tail_is_v5_clean
      THE VOICE-DOCTRINE-v5 SWEEP (2026-08-11), added when the tail banks were
      rewritten off the first-person question. No "I / my / we / our", no "?",
      no "!", no dash tells, ≤48 chars, no uncomputed stance, and every tail a
      full statement. Fails pre-v5 on all eight retired entries.
  test_fslr_fixture_carries_no_uncomputed_instruction
      The named case, end to end through the real writer, in both the
      state-available and no-bars worlds.
  test_a_known_technical_state_is_cited_in_the_copy
      Shape (b) is wired: a fixture with a known state produces copy that says
      it, not copy that ignores it.
  test_without_bars_the_copy_degrades_to_the_no_stance_shape
      Shape (a) is the floor: no state, no stance, and still a real post.
