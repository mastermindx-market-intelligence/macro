"""tests/test_prophet_live_reconcile.py — the nightly forward ledger (P0 D4).

This ledger is the entire evidence base for the §5/§6 promotion gauntlet and for the
operator's "acting at the intraday cross beats the graded next-close fill" question,
so the three ways it could quietly lie are all pinned here:

  * the FILL CONVENTION must be ``engine.grading``'s, not a lookalike. A ledger whose
    fill is the same-day close would flatter every row by one session of drift and
    would be un-comparable with the track record.
  * MERGING must be union + field-wise newest-non-null. A maturing fill written on a
    later night must not erase what the event night already knew, and running twice
    must change nothing (the frozen-replay lesson: a re-bake that moves numbers is
    indistinguishable from a bug).
  * ``confirmed`` must be None when unknown, never False. "Tonight's pack did not
    carry this name" and "tonight's gate rejected it" are different claims and the
    second one is the whole measurement.

SOLE-WRITER LAW (G0.2) is asserted structurally: the R2 spool is read-only here, and
the only path this module writes is ``data/prophet_live/forward.parquet``.

Clock is injected everywhere (``--now`` / ``now=``) and the price fixtures carry their
own pinned index, so nothing in this file can rot against a wall-clock gate.
