"""Tests for the Research Vault page build (RV W3).

Covers the SSR shell that scripts/build_research_vault.py renders:
  - the page builds from an EMPTY catalog (honest empty state, no fake cards) and
    from a seeded catalog (SSR cards baked for SEO/no-JS fallback, but withheld from
    the interactive first paint until the live catalog resolves);
  - the flagship structure is present: hero + This-Week figs, the three lane tabs
    (Latest/Top Picks/Saved), the browse rail + facet filter, the PDF viewer modal
    (auth-overlay clone) with its quota/download states, and the app + catalog island;
  - bilingual EN/ZH dual-spans are balanced (equal l-en / l-zh counts) and the
    <title> carries NO i18n markup / CJK (check_title_i18n contract);
  - the not-investment-advice footer + the "highlighted research, never a trade call"
    framing + the watermark microcopy are present (compliance);
  - the SSR card projection is public-safe (never leaks a body-text field).

Pure render — jinja2 only (already a dep); no R2, no network.
