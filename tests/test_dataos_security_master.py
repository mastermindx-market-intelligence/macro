"""Regression teeth for the security master + the time-scoped vendor alias table (DOS-1.1).

WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR.  ``tests/test_dataos_identity.py`` pins the identity VOCABULARY
against hand-built rows; nothing pinned the ARTIFACTS the vocabulary was built to
produce.  The two renames below are the whole reason the Data OS identity spine exists,
and each is a measured production defect, not a hypothetical:

* **MMC -> MRSH, 2026-01-14.**  Marsh McLennan changed its NYSE symbol (same listing,
  same CUSIP).  Yahoo migrated the whole history onto MRSH while
  ``scripts/fetch_basket_ohlcv`` carried only the FI->FISV entry, so
  ``data/baskets/ohlcv/MMC.parquet`` came to never exist: the ``insurance`` basket
  rendered 18/19 members and ``us_sector_financials`` 75/76 for SEVEN MONTHS and
  nothing went red (``lib/ticker_aliases.py`` module docstring).
* **SATS -> ECHO, 2026-06-24.**  EchoStar is logged TWICE in
  ``data/signal_archive/track_record.parquet`` — SATS 128 rows and ECHO 128 rows,
  identical ``(date, type)`` key sets, all 39 identity columns byte-identical — so
  every hit-rate, forward-return and drawdown statistic over that ledger
  DOUBLE-WEIGHTS one name (``engine/ledger_identity.py`` module docstring).  A table
  that knew MMC and not SATS would have reproduced the exact fragmentation being fixed.

Both halves are tested: the COMMITTED artifacts (which is what a consumer would read)
and the pure functions over fixtures (which is what a future change would break first).

TWO CLOCKS, PINNED APART (adversarial review, 2026-08-13).  A rename gives a security
two names and there are two different questions about them, so the table carries two
FAMILIES of vendor space and this suite refuses to let them be confused:

* HISTORICAL NAMING (``yahoo``, ``membership``, ``ledger``) — "what did this space call
  it ON that day", DATED across the rename.
* CURRENT CATALOG (``yahoo_fetch``, ``store``) — "what string do I use TODAY, for a bar
  of ANY date", ONE open-bounded row at today's symbol.

Reading the first as the second is the seven-month MMC outage in a new costume: Yahoo
migrated Marsh's WHOLE history onto MRSH, so a §11.4 backfill of 2020 that requested the
historically-correct ``MMC`` gets "possibly delisted, no price data found".
