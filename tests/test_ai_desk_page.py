"""AI Desk page (templates/ai_desk.html.j2 + ai_desk.js + scripts/build_ai_desk_page).

The page is client-rendered (ai_desk.js fetches ai_desk.json), so here we assert the
static chrome renders cleanly (nav, bilingual labels, the desk-root mount, the script
includes) with no unrendered Jinja, that the renderer covers the key surfaces (track
record, theses, falsifier, panel), and that the builder ships the renderer asset."""

    #     own bottom-right launcher, so the nav pill was a duplicate entry point.
    #   · "🖥️ AI Desk" — a self-link marked .active on the page it points at.

    # _navlinks.html.j2 and site-wide exactly ONE page links to it — itself. It
    # was already unreachable from the navigation; the pill only ever said "you

    # header contract is what this line always meant. theme.js:1492 strips any
