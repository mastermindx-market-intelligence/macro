"""The delisted-symbol exit ledger and the three behaviours it drives
(research/RESOLUTION_20260806_SIDE_STORE_SYMBOLS.md).

CTRA and TPH were carried for three months as "frozen feeds". They were not frozen:
Coterra closed its merger with Devon Energy on 2026-05-07 and Tri Pointe Homes closed
its merger with Sumitomo Forestry on 2026-05-14, both filed Form 25-NSE, and both
store tips are last trading sessions. TCNNF looked like the delisting of the three
(yfinance said "possibly delisted") and was the one live security — Trulieve uplisted
from the OTC quote to NYSE:TRLV.

Two claims are pinned here that a green test suite would otherwise leave open:
  * a delisted name is dropped from the FETCH but keeps its config membership, its
    store and its page — the fail-dark direction is as wrong as the fail-loud one;
  * a delisted name loses scoring authority WITHOUT depending on the lag arithmetic,
    because the R2 circuit breaker empties `demote_map` on exactly the runs where a
    dead name regaining a score would be least visible.

No network, no real config: every ledger read is monkeypatched onto a fixture so the
assertions pin behaviour rather than today's two rows.
