"""tests/test_unsubscribe_page.py — /unsubscribe.html (SEE W4, gate: boundary green).

The page is a port of the /support.html pinned design (mockups/support_email/PIN.md), so
this suite guards the properties an edit could quietly break without anything else going
red — the ones invisible in a screenshot:

  * **the serving boundary, PER MATCHER.** ``tests/test_site_access_boundary.py`` only
    diffs ONE Caddy matcher (the ``PUBLIC-BOUNDARY`` ``@reg_asset`` block) against
    ``config/site_access.yml``; the other five and ``app/regwall.py``'s mirror have no
    generic guard at all. ``test_support_page.py`` covers its own page with
    ``caddy.count("/support.html") == 6``, which is an occurrence COUNT — it passes if the
    path appears six times in one matcher and zero times in the other five. So this suite
    names each matcher and checks inside it. A page that 302s to sign-in is worthless
    here in a way it is not elsewhere: it is the only exit from marketing mail, and a
    broken one is a compliance failure, not a degraded feature;
  * it is deliberately OUT of the sitemap while being public — the inverse of every other
    public page, so it needs its own assertion;
  * nothing mutates on load (a mail scanner must not be able to unsubscribe anybody);
  * the API contract, both languages, no translated ``title=``;
  * PIN §1.1 — success/error use ``--ok``/``--act`` and NEVER ``--up``/``--down``, which
    theme.css swaps under ``html[data-lang="zh"]``.

    precedent). It has to be the CURRENT render, or the boundary lists a stale file.

    The comparison is against the page AS THE RENDER LANE SHIPS IT, so this rebuild has to
    replay the lane's whole post-processing chain — ``render.yml`` runs, in this order:

        build_site  ->  inject_data_base  ->  externalize_css  ->  optimize_assets

    Skip a link and the assert stops meaning "the page is stale" and starts meaning "a
    normalizer ran", which is the state main is always in between renders. It shipped that
    way once: the chain here was missing ``externalize_css``, so every inline ``<style>``
    over 1KB — the page's own CSS and the nav mega block, ~280 diff lines — read as
    divergence, and this test was red on main (and therefore ``ci-pack-1`` red on every PR
    in the repo) from the first render after #3743 landed.

    ``inject_wh_banner`` is the one sweep that CANNOT be replayed, and it is a live time
    bomb rather than a hypothetical: ``daily.yml`` runs it over ``site/**/*.html`` with no
    exclusion list, ``render.yml`` does not, so whether this page carries the ticker tag
    depends on which lane touched it last. Replaying it unconditionally would redden the
    test today (223 of 243 root pages, this one and /support.html included, currently ship
    without the tag); NOT handling it reddens the test the first time a daily run lands the
    tag here. So it is stripped from both sides — the treatment #3675 settled on for the
    same sweep, whose regex is imported rather than restated so the two cannot drift. It is
    a marker-guarded additive tag immediately before </body> that changes nothing else.

    Normalising the difference away instead (strip ``?v=`` stamps, ignore ``<style>`` vs
    ``<link>``) would have been the weaker fix: replaying the step keeps the externalized
    CSS compared byte-for-byte, because the href IS the content hash. What must never be
    done is re-rendering the page and committing that — ``site/`` is render-lane territory
    and a hand-render out of a worktree ships a stale-checkout clobber.

    ``make_href`` below mirrors ``scripts.externalize_css`` except that it writes nothing:
    this suite renders into tmp only and must not touch ``site/``. The lane's threshold is
    imported rather than restated so the two cannot drift apart silently.

    # The seventh funnel-shell script, promoted deliberately (#6141, 2026-08-20)
    # and qualifying on the same standard as the six above: portfolio_state.js is
    # the DOM-free pure computation of the canonical Portfolio read. It makes no
    # network call of its own, and the portfolio_snapshot.v1 object it derives
    # stays in the client and never leaves it — the visitor's own book, exactly
    # like the localStorage store the other funnel scripts read.

    # Worth recording HOW it arrived, because this set exists to catch that
    # shape: #6109 (A1A) added it to the Caddyfile's public matchers and to
    # @watchlist_shell_versioned but to no policy file, so for a day the edge
    # served it anonymously while app/paywall.py still classified it `premium` —
    # the two enforcement halves disagreed, and the cross-check that exists to
    # catch precisely that went red and merged anyway because its only CI home
    # was a `gate: data` job. #6141 reconciled the policy to what the edge was
    # already doing and put that guard on the merge gate. This frozen set is the
    # third place the promotion had to be argued, and it is argued here on the
    # merits above, not merely reconciled: a widening is not ratified by having
    # already happened.
