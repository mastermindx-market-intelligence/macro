"""W1-C — three-shelf lifecycle render tests.

Verifies the ENTRY / RIPENING / RAN partition in templates/china.html.j2 (mode=stocks):
  - BUY-family words (BUY/买入/act now) appear on ENTRY shelf only
  - No green (buy) card banding on RAN_LATE cards
  - Every shelf header has dual-span (l-en + l-zh)
  - Zero non-ASCII attribute delimiters anywhere in the template
  - Jinja parse (the most important gate)
  - Smoke render with synthetic context containing all three arrays

Mirrors the idiom of tests/test_china_stocks_copy_w09.py (the nearest sibling).

Prophet-card redesign (2026-07-21) — what moved, and why this suite was re-pinned:
  - The ENTRY and RAN/LATE shelf cards no longer use the old nb-card markup. The old
    per-card stage badges (the green ENTRY badge + the muted RAN badge), the why-ranked
    chip, and the entry-gauge green-banding classes are all DEAD (they survive only as
    unreferenced CSS rules; this suite no longer asserts against any of them).
    Cards now render via {{ pv.pv_card({...}) }} from templates/_prophet_card.html.j2:
      · ENTRY rows -> verb 'buy'  (class="pvcard pv-buy",  stage 3 -> 'Ready' on)
      · RAN/LATE   -> verb 'wait' (class="pvcard pv-wait", stage 4 -> 'Trend' on)
    The verb hue (--pv-buy) stays bullish under either language convention; a WAIT card
    uses amber by construction, so B1/B2 is enforced structurally, not by suppression.
  - GOTCHA: the pv_css() <style> block emits the class SELECTORS `.pv-buy`, `.pv-wait`
    etc. as literal text, so the bare substrings "pv-buy" / "pv-wait" are ALWAYS present
    in the output. Card-presence / card-absence assertions MUST target the full
    element-class string 'class="pvcard pv-buy"' / 'class="pvcard pv-wait"'.
  - why_ranked / tier / sig detail were DELIBERATELY demoted off this surface into the
    china_lookup analyzer (template comment ~L3206). test_why_ranked_chip_on_entry_cards
    was DELETED for that reason (2026-07-21) — the data was not lost, it moved a click away.
  - The i18n global tr() (engine/i18n.tr — canonical-ZH glossary lookup, EN fallback) is
    injected by the real builders; the harness registers the REAL tr so assertions pin
    real translation behavior (e.g. tr("BUY ZONE") == "买入区"), never a guess.
