"""Every customer-facing chat allowance must agree with the config that enforces it.

MNZ-R13 (`research/MASTERMIND_COMMERCIAL_ARCHITECTURE.md` §7). `config/brain.yml` is what
`engine.neuralweb.brain_gateway._get_allowance` reads to decide whether a request is
allowed. SEVEN customer surfaces sell those allowances. Six are in this repository and are
covered here; the seventh is in another repo and is not:

  1. `templates/plans.html.j2`  — DERIVED (lib/chat_allowance.py → both plans builders)
  2. `templates/index.html`     — hand-authored plain-copy landing: literals
  3. `templates/onboard.js`     — the signup/upgrade sheet: literals
  4. `templates/theme.js`       — `SD_PLAN_FEATURES`, the signed-in billing summary: literals
  5. `templates/chat.html`      — the signed-out chat gate's tier list: literals
  6. (the Terminal's `components/onboarding/plans.ts` is prices-only — no chat numbers)
  7. **NOT COVERED — the Terminal's `terminal/lib/i18n.tsx`**, in the charting-app repo.
     It carries `obInsider2: ["20 Pro AI dives a month", …]` while `config/brain.yml` says
     Essential deep is 10/month. A cross-repo guard is the open item; see the commercial
     implementation plan.

Each surface was found later than the last, which is the argument of this file: surfaces 2–4
were pinned first, 5 was found by adversarial review (and was WRONG — it advertised the value
of `brain_gateway`'s hardcoded fallback rather than the live config), and 7 was found by the
review after that (also wrong). Surfaces 2–5 cannot derive at build time — they ship as bytes,
and index.html/theme.js/chat.html are byte-paired with their `site/` copies. **A literal a
test pins to its enforcer is safe; an unbound one is not.**

WHAT THIS TEST IS NOT ABOUT
---------------------------
It is not fixing a false claim. On 2026-08-12 every literal on all five surfaces was
CORRECT, including "Unlimited" / 无限量 for the Pro fast lane — that is the honest
rendering of `quotas.pro.fast.limit: -1`, the uncapped sentinel documented in
`_get_allowance` ("A negative configured limit means uncapped requests for that lane")
and set by operator ruling 2026-07-28. The defect was that nothing bound them.
