"""Audit #39 — calibration-frame reconciliation tests.

Two protocol invariants for the recession/nowcast/business-cycle signals whose
advertised stats were calibrated on a different data frame than they fire on:

1. PIT-frame invariance — a stat computed AS-OF date D must not move when data that
   arrived AFTER D is appended. Proven on the drawdown-risk band table's PIT
   ('release') accessor: truncating the vintage/store to <= D and asking for the
   as-of value yields the same number whether or not post-D revisions exist.

2. Lag-config consistency — the LIVE business-cycle signal must fire at the SAME
   publication lag its calibration (and its advertised lead/FP stats) were measured
   at, OR the artifact must carry both stats. We assert the live lag equals the
   calibrated lag and that the snapshot ships a lag passport + a marked shadow of the
   pre-fix reading.
