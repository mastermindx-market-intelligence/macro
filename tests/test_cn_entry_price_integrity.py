"""CN forward-ledger ENTRY-PRICE INTEGRITY — the 300363.SZ (博腾股份) regression.

WHAT WENT WRONG (measured, research/cn_prophet_audit/CASE_300363_FULL_CHAIN_2026-08-08.md)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The operator's flagship CN winner surfaced #1 on the 2026-08-05 board. Its published
forward-ledger entry `e` was the T+1 open, RE-DERIVED from the price store on every
nightly — so a published number was mutable:

    2026-08-06 nightly   e = 16.30   l = 17.03   p = +4.5%
    2026-08-08 (today)   e = 17.52   l = 20.44   p = +16.7%      ← silently restated

The cause was an impossible bar. The 2026-08-06 T+1 bar as stored that night read
**open 16.2999 against low 16.98** — the open sat 4% BELOW the session low, which cannot
happen — and nothing on the entry path checked ``open ∈ [low, high]``. The ledger took it
at face value, published a return off it, and swapped in a different entry (+7.5% higher)
once the bar healed. Two compounding defects rode along: the entry was never latched, and
``fill_basis`` published the ENTRY_BASIS CONSTANT ("t1_hl2") for rows that used neither
HL2 (08-06 HL2 = 17.38) nor the same price twice.

WHAT THIS FILE PINS
-------------------
1. BAR SANITY   — a corrupt T+1 bar never supplies an entry; it falls back to the
                  documented HL2 basis, or DEFERS when even high/low are inconsistent.
                  A line-start ``::warning`` names ticker + date.
2. PIT LATCH    — the entry a row has published is the entry it keeps. A healed bar is
                  disclosed additively (``e_revised`` / ``er``), never substituted, and the
                  published return `p` derives from the latched entry.
3. PROVENANCE   — ``basis_used`` / ``eb`` says what actually happened.
4. LANE GATE    — only the asia nightly may ADVANCE the latch, proven on the path the
                  workflows take rather than by hand-feeding ``lane=``. The latch is
                  keep-first, so the first lane to write a (date, ticker) owns that entry
                  price forever; daily.yml, weekly.yml and asia-close.yml all run
                  scripts.build_china_library, so a permissive gate lets SCHEDULING ORDER
                  pick a published number. §4 is the fail-closed pin (added 2026-08-09 —
                  the gate itself shipped dead: the one production call site passed no
                  lane at all, so it always took the permissive branch).

Every test carries its own witness that the fixture can SEE the failure — the corrupt and
healed bars are constructed so the old and new answers differ by 7.5%, and the latch tests
re-run the same resolution with an empty latch to prove the restatement is reachable.

# 4. THE LANE GATE, ON THE PATH PRODUCTION ACTUALLY TAKES
# ===========================================================================
# The latch is keep-FIRST and immutable, so the FIRST lane to write a (date, ticker) owns
# that published entry price forever — and .github/workflows/daily.yml (`git add data/`) and
# weekly.yml (`git add data/ reports/ site/`) BOTH run scripts.build_china_library, as does
# asia-close.yml. Whichever ran first would decide the number, which is the very property
# the latch exists to remove.
#
# The gate that was supposed to stop that shipped DEAD: `append_entry_latches` refused only
# when a lane was passed AND was not asia, the one production call site passed no lane at
# all, and the only test of the gate hand-fed `lane=` — green guard, no coverage of the path
# the workflows take. These tests drive the production entry point and read the STORE.
