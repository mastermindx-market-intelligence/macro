"""tests/test_tech_lab_offrender_budget.py — the nightly Technical Lab lane's budget.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`site/confluence_screener.html` was linked from the research mega menu on every
page of the site from 2026-07-19 and had NEVER been rendered once — the URL was
a live 404 for eight days.

The page is rendered by step 5 of daily.yml's `tech_lab_offrender`, and
committed by step 6.  Step 2 of that same job (`build_tech_lab_data`) went from
64 signals to 195 on a 231-ticker universe in #3013 — merged 2026-07-19T01:40,
about four hours BEFORE #3061 added the screener render to the tail of the same
job.  Nobody re-budgeted `timeout-minutes: 40`.  Measured from the 07-26 job
log, the expanded pass costs ~14.6s/ticker → ~56 min, so every nightly from
07-19 to 07-26 was cancelled at exactly the 40m cap partway through step 2, and
steps 3-6 — including the screener render AND the commit — were skipped.

The per-step `set +e … exit 0` wrappers did not help and could not: they make a
*script* error non-fatal, while a job timeout hard-cancels the running step,
skips every later step, and suppresses the `::warning` the step would have
printed.  The job simply reported "cancelled", which is indistinguishable at a
glance from this repo's known-benign cancellations — so an eight-day publish
outage (the screener page, plus stale tech_screener/tech_lab/tech_confluence/
tech_events/m2_profiles artifacts) drew no signal at all.

What is pinned here is the reachability of the publish tail: a budget that
covers the measured workload, and the render step still sitting ahead of the
commit step that ships it.
