"""tests/test_shared_pref_atomics.py — the cross-product shared-preference contract (E6).

`user_metadata.prefs` is a NESTED object, and supabase `auth.updateUser` REPLACES a nested
object wholesale. TWO browsers write it — this dashboard (templates/theme.js) and the
Mastermind Terminal (terminal/lib/accountPrefs.ts) — so each one's write silently discarded
whatever the other had changed since it last read:

    1. Terminal reads  {theme: dark, lang: en}
    2. here: the user picks Light  -> we write the WHOLE object
    3. Terminal, still holding its snapshot, changes language to Chinese
    4. Terminal sends {theme: dark, lang: zh}
    5. the Light choice from step 2 is gone.

Serializing either product's own writes cannot fix that — the race is BETWEEN the products —
and a fresh-read-before-write only shrinks the window, because read and write are not atomic.

The repair removes the shared container: each field is its own TOP-LEVEL key, and top-level
keys MERGE. This module pins the JS side of that as a source contract, the same way
tests/test_canada_build.py asserts on templates/theme.js text: there is no browser harness in
this repo, and a silent regression here is invisible until two live products disagree.
