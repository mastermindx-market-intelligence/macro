"""SI Workspace V2 shell invariants.

Charter: research/SI_WORKSPACE_V2_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md §0 gates, §1 shell
contract, §1b visual spec, §2b view partition + LEGACY_ANCHORS table.

What this file is defending, and why each pin exists rather than being obvious:

* **Comment parity.** An unclosed ``{#`` does not raise — it swallows everything
  up to the NEXT ``#}`` anywhere later in the file. This template carries 34 Jinja
  comments and a 72KB head; a swallow eats charset/title/theme.css out of the head
  while the body still renders perfectly. A body-only invariant sweep reads that as
  a pass, so parity is asserted directly AND the rendered head is checked in bytes.
* **Router table.** The organs kept their section ids specifically so the router can
  reach them. If a legacy id is dropped from LEGACY_ANCHORS the corresponding deep
  link silently lands on overview instead of 404-ing — a failure with no symptom
  except a user who never finds the panel again.
* **Var-native shell CSS.** Light mode is a first-class surface here (gate 7), and
  the way it silently stops being one is a literal colour picked to look right in
  dark and never re-checked in light.
