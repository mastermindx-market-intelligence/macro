"""tests/test_marketing_liveness_tripwire.py — the alarm that ends "green and dark".

WHAT IS BEING PINNED. Between 2026-08-06 and 2026-08-10 the marketing publisher
posted NOTHING and every 30-minute sweep concluded GREEN. Buffer's plan locked
(429s) on 08-06, ``MARKETING_PUBLISH_ENABLED`` went to 0 on 08-08 while the
backend refused, Buffer was fixed, and nobody re-armed it. A dry-run sweep is a
successful sweep, so the workflow had nothing to fail on.

``scripts/marketing_liveness_tripwire.py`` is the observer for that shape. Its
decision is factored into ``evaluate(now, armed, last_live_post_at, cfg)`` — a
pure function — precisely so the rules can be pinned here without a process, an
env var or a real ledger. The properties that matter:

  * armed + silent + deep in the posting window is a RED sweep, not a warning;
  * armed + silent at 11:30Z is NOT — the ladder's overnight gap is normal, and
    an alarm that cries every morning is an alarm nobody reads;
  * disarmed is allowed, being disarmed for a DAY has to be re-decided out loud:
    a warning on every sweep and one red at 13:00Z;
  * an unknown last-post time reads as very old, never as fine (no receipts is
    the state a five-day outage ends in);
  * a dry-run row is not a post, and a truncated row is not a crash.

Every annotation is asserted to START with ``::`` — the house law this lane broke
once already (CLAUDE.md, "GitHub annotations must START the line": a ``::warning``
handed to a logger is dropped by GitHub, which is how the publisher's disarmed
downgrade shipped invisible). tests/test_gh_annotation_line_start.py guards the
emitter side; this file guards that the strings themselves stay well-formed.

Sparse worktrees: every file this suite reads is built under ``tmp_path``. It
never touches repo ``data/``.
