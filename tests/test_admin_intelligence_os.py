"""tests/test_admin_intelligence_os.py — the Intelligence OS admin surface.

FIXTURE ROOTS ONLY, same law as the T4 suite this joins: nothing here reads the live
``config/synapse.yml`` or asserts anything about the live estate's health. The registry
took 69 commits in a trailing fortnight and "an artifact is stale tonight" is operational
data, not a PR defect — either would turn this lane into a nightly alarm about work the
operator has not done yet.

THE LOAD-BEARING TEST IS :func:`test_reflectivity_a_new_engine_appears_with_no_code_edit`.
The panel is only worth having if the estate is its source: an engine added to the
registry must show up with no edit here, and one removed must disappear. A page that has
to be taught about each engine is a second registry wearing a dashboard's clothes, and it
goes wrong exactly when it matters — quietly, at the moment the estate changes.
