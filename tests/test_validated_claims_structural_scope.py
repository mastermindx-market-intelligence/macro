"""BC-2: structural non-claims MASK IN PLACE, and site/prophet/*.json is in scope.

THE INCIDENT (2026-08-11). The anonymous landing page shipped an unearned bilingual
claim pair — "… is below its long-term trend — validated drawdown gate: size down …" /
"…已跌破长期趋势 — 已验证的回撤门槛：减小仓位。" — LIVE on templates/index.html and
site/index.html, with BC-2 reading green the whole time.

Two independent blindnesses had to line up, and this file pins both:

  1. `_STRUCTURAL` was a set of WHOLE-LINE kills. The entry
     `"(?:absolute_trend_gate|weighting|timing|note)"\\s*:.*validated` matched a `"note":`
     key ANYWHERE on a line, and the landing page bakes its showcase slice into one
     ~23,000-character `<script id="ph-data">` JSON island. One structural match therefore
     suppressed every claim in the entire island. The rule now MASKS the structural span
     in place (the _TP_CUT sentinel) instead of dropping the line, exactly as the
     2026-07-29 `_IDENT_MASK` narrowing did for CSS selectors and for the same reason:
     "Whole-line suppression was half the reason the old rule was invisible."

  2. `SCAN_GLOBS` reached `site/prophet/plans` only, so `site/prophet/showcase.json` —
     the artifact the landing island is baked FROM, carrying four fossilised board
     cautions — was never scanned at all. The glob is now `site/prophet` (scan() walks
     with rglob), and templates/*.html is scanned so the hand-authored landing SOURCE is
     gated beside its render.

Everything here goes through the REAL gate (`scan_text`), never a re-implementation, so
the tests fail if the production code path moves. Cases 1 and 6 are the mutation proof:
both PASS against this commit's guard and FAIL against the guard on origin/main.
