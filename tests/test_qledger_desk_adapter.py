"""Tests for engine/qledger_desk_adapter.py — Eval OS P3 PROSPECTIVE
registration for stock_desk / thematic_desk / demand_chain.

THE ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINT UNDER TEST: nothing retrospective ever registers. A
prior attempt (branch claude/eval-os-t9-adoption, never merged) was refused
3/3 by adversarial review because stock_desk/thematic_desk claims were
anchored and priced at a close already 1-4 completed sessions in the past —
the graded window had already started printing bars by the time the row was
"registered". `outcome_not_yet_determined` is the fix, and the test below
(`test_stale_asof_is_refused_as_retrospective`) is the one this whole program
turns on: a thesis whose window has already begun MUST be refused.

Hermetic: tmp_path stores only, no network, no live data/qledger. No price
mocking is needed anywhere in this file — every function under test here is
either pure calendar arithmetic (`outcome_not_yet_determined`, via
`qledger.resolve_horizon_window`) or metadata assembly from an already-priced
row's own `entry_levels` dict (`translate_row`); nothing reads the parquet
price layer during registration (grading is a separate, later nightly step,
out of scope for this file).
