"""Consolidated AI Daily Brief page (aibrief.html) render + nav-cleanup regression.

The old deterministic daily brief (scripts/daily_brief.py -> brief.html, plus the
china/hk variants) was retired and replaced by ONE static page that surfaces the
three EXISTING AI briefs written by engine/master_brain.py
(master_brief.json / china_brief.json / btc_brief.json) as toggle tabs.

ABX v2 (2026-07-19): the three lens brief BODIES are now SERVER-rendered by the
shared macro templates/_aibrief_body.html.j2 (build_aibrief.py loads the JSONs into
master_brief / china_brief / btc_brief). templates/aibrief.js was slimmed to the
overnight-cortex panel only. These tests render the REAL template (same Jinja env
as scripts/build_aibrief) and guard, at the source level, that no template ever
re-links the deleted brief pages.
