"""The zh half of a macro alert body must be fully Chinese.

Six rules used to interpolate an English-valued token straight into their
`message_zh` f-string, so the wrapper punctuation and the surrounding nouns
translated while the clause inside them did not — the shape that shipped

    EN  GEX: net GEX changed sign (net +79bn, spot vs flip -0.7%)
    ZH  GEX：net GEX changed sign（净 +79bn，现价相对翻转点 -0.7%）

to the landing hub's "What changed" rows and the macro dashboard's
`ms-sig-detail`. The emitter is the only path the dashboard has (it renders
freshly-evaluated Alert objects, never the log), so a leak there is unrecoverable
downstream.

Three properties are pinned here:

  1. no English prose survives in an emitted `message_zh`;
  2. the emitter and `_translate_macro_detail` — build_vector's backlog translator
     for rows that predate the `message_zh` column — produce the SAME Chinese for
     the same alert. They disagreed for six rules, the emitter (which wins) was
     the wrong one, and nothing noticed;
  3. the already-baked half-translated rows in alerts_log.parquet still render
     fully Chinese through the hub's resolution, because log_and_dedup keys on
     (date, rule, message) and the English message never changes — no corrected
     row will ever supersede them.

`cycle_falsifier_fired:*` is the same defect one level up and is fenced in the
final section. It quotes a market thesis the curator WROTE — free prose, not a
finite label — so no vocabulary map can render it; the fix was a `claim_zh`
column in data/cycle_ontology/falsifiers.json plus a `_CYCLE_ZH` map for the
lowercase cycle slug the message also interpolates. The three properties above
apply to it unchanged.
