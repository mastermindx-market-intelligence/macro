"""Tests for the W3-C sponsor -> ticker reviewed map.

The map is a bounded, curated, PR-reviewed lookup, not an inferred join and not
a point-in-time identity service.  These tests pin the review semantics that
are the whole point of the lane:

* no row may be admitted WITHOUT attributed human authority — an admitted row
  must carry a complete operator attestation (named reviewer, timestamp, and
  the authorizing ruling bound by path and content digest), so a model cannot
  promote its own suggestion into an authoritative link;
* the reader resolves ``reviewed_admitted`` rows and refuses everything else
  with a REASON instead of a guess;
* ambiguity is queued with its competing candidates recorded, never picked, and
  a blanket authorization does not resolve it;
* an admitted row says whether its ticker is the sponsor itself or the
  sponsor's PARENT, so a subsidiary row cannot read as an issuer row; and
* the effective interval is mandatory, so a rename or ticker reuse opens a new
  interval instead of rewriting history.

The 29 candidate rows were admitted by the repository operator on 2026-08-07
under ``research/BIOCATALYST_OPERATOR_RULING_2026-08-07.md`` (Ruling 2).  The 20
ambiguous rows stayed queued: a blanket "yes" cannot answer a
subsidiary-versus-parent or joint-venture question.

Ruling 3 (2026-08-08) then answered ONE of those questions per-case: the four
``subsidiary_of_listed_issuer`` rows were admitted to their listed parents, and
the other **16 stay queued**.  ``test_the_sixteen_still_ambiguous_rows_were_left_exactly_as_they_were``
holds those 16 byte-identical to the base branch, so an admission the operator
did authorize cannot quietly carry along one they did not.
