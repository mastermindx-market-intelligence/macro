"""Point-in-time honesty of `data/baskets/membership.json` member stamps (W1-C).

WHAT WENT WRONG (measured 2026-08-07). `gold_miners` was created 2026-07-30 and
`silver_miners` 2026-08-05, yet every member of both claimed ``added: 2023-05-09``
— the file's `seed_date`. Read literally that says the desk had been watching the
whole precious-metals complex for three years. It had not: the rosters are days
old. The consequence was not cosmetic. ``data/basket_turn/ledger.jsonl`` stamps
``silver_miners IGNITION k=4`` on 2026-08-05, the same day the sleeve was curated,
and with back-dated membership there was nothing in the file to say that row is a
first observation rather than a detection.

WHY `added` IS NOT THE FIELD TO FIX. `added` is the equal-weight index-inclusion
mask, not a provenance stamp: ``engine/baskets.py:89-91`` builds the live mask as
``idx >= added`` and roughly twenty sibling engines repeat that shape
(``engine/basket_index.py:277``, ``engine/theme_scoring.py:960``,
``engine/group_flow.py:509``, ``engine/oracle/panel.py:976``, …). Rewriting `added`
to the true curation date truncates the price mask for **768 of 1,034 members
across 34 baskets** — including all eleven ``us_sector_*`` sleeves, 503 members
between them — collapsing their charts to days of history and dropping them under
``engine/narrative_rotation.py``'s ``MIN_HISTORY_D = 160`` floor. The back-projection
is a legitimate charting convention; what was missing was the disclosure and a
separate honest date.

WHAT THIS PINS. Every member carries `curated_added` — the date a curator actually
put that name in that basket — alongside the unchanged `added` mask, the file
explains the difference in `added_semantics`, and `history_note` (already surfaced
to readers via ``engine/baskets.py:291``) says the levels are back-projected. The
checks below run against the REAL committed file and against deliberately broken
synthetic documents, so the guard is proven able to see the failure rather than
merely agreeing with today's data.
