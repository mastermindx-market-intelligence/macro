"""tests/test_marketing_cadence_ramp_coherence.py — the persona spec may never be
the throttle.

WHAT WENT WRONG. `engine/marketing/cadence_resolver.py` is the per-account law
(XG-W2) and `sentinel.ramp` is the per-account age ramp (D08). They are ANDed at
post time, so whichever is smaller is what a desk actually gets. Nobody kept them
in the same units. On 2026-07-28 the ramp said 10 posts/day for a new desk and 20
for the flagship, #3904 rebuilt the ladder (28 rungs at 30 min) around exactly
that, and every persona spec still carried the W1 declaration — 3-4 posts/day at
a 120-180 MINUTE spacing floor. The resolver was running in SHADOW, so the
mismatch cost nothing and showed up only as log lines:

    flagship  posts_per_day=4  daily_budget=4  posted_today=3  would_refuse: min_spacing
    sophia    posts_per_day=3  daily_budget=3  posted_today=2  would_refuse: min_spacing
    founder   posts_per_day=3  daily_budget=3  posted_today=3  would_refuse: daily_cap

Arming the resolver on those numbers would have dropped the network from 70
posts/day to 20 and made every cap #3904 raised dead config. This suite is the
standing guard so a future spec edit cannot silently re-introduce that throttle.

THE FOUR RELATIONS THIS SUITE PINS.

  1. VOLUME.  posts_per_day >= every ramp cap the desk will ever resolve to.
     Checked against the REAL resolve_ramp at the desk's own created date + 0 /
     14 / 28 / graduate_after_days, so tier merging and per-account overrides are
     exercised rather than re-implemented here. The ramp stays the governor: a
     week-1 desk is held at 10/day by its TIER, which is visible in the gate
     report, not by a hand-written number buried in a persona file.

  2. LADDER FIT.  min_spacing_min * posts_per_day must fit inside the ladder
     window (28 rungs, 4:00 AM-5:30 PM PT = 810 minutes). A floor larger than
     ladder_span / posts_per_day is self-contradictory: the desk is told to post
     n times inside a window that cannot hold n posts at that spacing. Also
     checked with jitter folded in, because the resolver's real requirement is
     `min_spacing_min + jitter`, not `min_spacing_min`.

  3. SWEEP QUANTISATION.  min_spacing_min + jitter_min <= one ladder rung minus
     publish.post_jitter_max_min. This is the relation that actually decides
     throughput and it is invisible from the config alone. The publisher sweeps
     every 30 minutes and books each post at `now + jitter` (up to
     post_jitter_max_min = 7), while the resolver measures elapsed time from that
     BOOKED stamp at the next sweep — so the gap it sees is 30 - 7 = 23 minutes
     at worst. A floor above 23 makes every post miss its next rung and wait two,
     halving the desk's day while every number in the config still reads fine.
     Measured: min_spacing_min 30 (which merely MATCHES the ramp's stated
     min_minutes_between_posts) yields ~15 posts/day against a 20/day tier.

  4. THE SESSION FENCE.  A `cadence.session` desk can be capped by its territory
     windows long before either volume number binds — the fence is ANDed too.
     Cici's original windows overlapped the publisher's own cron window for only
     3.5 hours, which held her to ~11 slots however high posts_per_day went. The
     fence must leave at least as many sweeps as the desk's widest ramp cap.

Plus the operator's standing target (2026-07-28: >= 10 posts/day per account, 20
for the flagship) asserted against the ramp itself, and a tripwire pinning the
ladder/cron constants the arithmetic above is derived from — so a future ladder
or cron change turns this suite RED instead of quietly making it vacuous.
