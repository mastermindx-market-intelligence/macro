"""A GitHub Actions annotation must START its line — so it can never go through logging.

GitHub only parses a workflow command (``::warning ...``, ``::error ...``,
``::notice ...``) when ``::`` is the first thing on the line.  Every builder in
this repo configures logging with a prefixing format — ``"%(levelname)s %(message)s"``
and friends — so ``log.warning("::warning title=x::…")`` emits::

    WARNING ::warning title=x::…

and GitHub silently drops it.  The call looks like an alarm in code review, runs
without error, and produces NOTHING in the Actions summary.  That is the worst
possible failure mode for a fail-soft: the builder ships degraded output and the
only signal it was supposed to raise does not exist.

This has now shipped dead at least five separate times (#3487, #3515, #3563,
#3570, and #3562 — which merged a fresh one on 2026-07-26, the same day the
others were being fixed).  Hence a guard rather than another one-off repair.

The fix is always the same: emit the annotation with a bare ``print`` to stdout,
and keep a ``log.*`` line (with ``exc_info`` where there is a traceback worth
having) when the human-readable log deserves more detail than the annotation.
