"""W2 nightly runtime telemetry (masterplan §0.2 acceptance gate).

Two halves:

1. BEHAVIOR — scripts/nightly_timings.py: a synthetic run at 86% of its cap
   MUST trip the ``::warning`` (at line start — GitHub parses ``::`` only at
   column 0), an 84% run must NOT, bands are computed from the marks, and dark
   telemetry (no start stamp) is loud instead of silently recording nothing.

2. WIRING — .github/workflows/daily.yml AND .github/workflows/asia-close.yml:
   every instrumentable self-hosted job carries the job-start mark as its FIRST
   step and the ``if: always()`` finish step LAST (bar the delivery tail below),
   and the finish step's cap argument equals the job's actual
   ``timeout-minutes``. This is the anti-drift pin: raising a cap without
   updating the finish arg would silently rescale the 85% tripwire (the same
   stale-label class that produced the tech_lab 8-day outage). asia-close joined
   the scan for W-L4 gate 1: its ``asia`` job spends 46.1m of adapter wall-clock
   (55 sources, measured 2026-08-09) in no timings band on any job.

3. PERSISTENCE — the row has to survive the night it is most needed. `always()`
   is not enough on its own: a timeout-cancel gives the whole remaining
   always() tail one ~5-minute grace window, so a finish step parked behind a
   heavy delivery step never gets scheduled. That is exactly what happened to
   the engine job (run 31067383446, 2026-08-06: cancelled at 200m cap + 5m
   grace, `upload pages artifact` ended `failure` at the wall, and the finish
   step never appeared in the step list at all) — 15 of 16 jobs had native rows
   and engine had a single `backfill-gh-api` one, leaving the 85% tripwire dark
   for the one job whose creep caused the Jul31-Aug6 outage. The tests below
   pin the ordering that fixes it and the loudness of every early exit in
   scripts/ci/nightly_timings_finish.sh.
