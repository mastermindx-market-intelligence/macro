"""tests/test_watchlist_workspace_js.py — the W2 Portfolio Intelligence workspace.

W2 rebuilt `watchlist.html` as a two-mode workspace over the W1a store seam. The store
half is pinned by tests/test_watchstore_multilist_js.py and is deliberately untouched
here. What this file pins is the layer W2 added, and specifically the places where an
honest read and a plausible-looking lie are one keystroke apart:

  1. The bulk-entry parser. It is the anonymous funnel's front door: a line it silently
     drops is a position the visitor believes we read.
  2. The weighting model. "Equal" must ignore typed sizes; every other mode must use
     them and DISCLOSE when it had to fall back.
  3. The engine-state -> plain-word stage map. It may only ever DE-ESCALATE: a state
     whose honest reading is "still falling" can never become an up-word, and an
     unknown state must become "Not covered", never a guess.
  4. Delta-since-visit. The header count and the column ink come from ONE computation,
     so the page cannot say "4 changed" over three marked rows.
  5. The visibilitychange re-pull, hardened (see below).
  6. The OUTER catch in `_foldLocalIntoCloud` (reviewer residual from PR #5461).

Same harness as its two sibling suites: these modules are browser IIFEs, node-shelled
behind minimal window/document/localStorage stubs with readyState 'loading' so init()
never runs and only the pure logic is exercised.

    Visit Watchlists mode, then click Portfolio with nothing in the book. Holdings
    correctly said "No positions yet" while the Risk Center's Concentration tab went on
    reading "One name, ETH-USD, carries 40% of this book's risk" off names the reader does
    not own. A fresh load straight into Portfolio mode looked perfect, which is what kept
    this hidden: the leak needs a prior Watchlists render to have filled `LAST`.

    Neither end of the chain was at fault. watchlist.js stopped feeding the blob to FX on
    the Portfolio click (the test above), portfolio.js correctly reported an empty book

    handed. In between, `render()` fell back to `LAST` — the WATCHLIST — whenever there
    was no auto book, so the empty-book report REPUBLISHED the watchlist as "this book".

    The assertion is the composed Concentration tab, so it pins what the reader sees

# this repo has ever produced — `g === 'high'`, `g === 'extreme'` — where `g` came
# from `extGradeOf`, whose entire range is engine/extension.py's GRADES plus the two
# literal fallbacks. The result was not a wrong flag; it was NO flag: the "Stretched"
# attention chip and Risk Desk rules 1 and 3 were structurally unreachable from the
# night they landed, and every instrument we own read green, because dead code raises
# nothing. Reviewing the diff could not catch it either — `'high'` and `'extreme'`
# are exactly what a stretch grade SHOULD be called, and the file never says what it
# is actually called.
#
# So the vocabulary is pinned across the seam rather than restated on this side: the
# allowed literals are READ from engine/extension.py, and any string compared against
# an `extGradeOf` result must be one of them. A rename on either side now reds here.

    (e.g. a Concentration read keyed to the WATCHLIST'S names) survived a switch into
    Portfolio and renderRiskCenter() happily repainted it there, even with 0 Portfolio
    positions. FROZEN FIX: setMode() resets RISK to the same empty default literal
    setRisk()/the module init use, BEFORE calling render() — so a Watchlists-mode
    payload can never be the one renderRiskCenter() paints once the reader has
    switched into Portfolio.

    Behavioral (not source-pinned): this drives the REAL setMode()/setRisk()/
    renderRiskCenter() chain end to end and reads the painted `#rc_body` DOM, the same
    shape test_portfolio_mode_does_not_feed_the_watchlist_blob_to_fx above already

    LAW 3 mechanical accommodation (A1A round-3, F6 adversarial-review finding):
    setRisk() now rejects any payload without provenance matching the CURRENT
    scope+generation (fail-closed). Without a `prov` field this call would be
    rejected BEFORE ever reaching `RISK =`, which would make the assertions
    below pass vacuously (the enteringPortfolio reset this test exists to pin

# 12. the ANONYMOUS Risk Center — the lock shell, and the CSS that is the
#     other half of the two early returns in render()
# ===========================================================================
#
# Reported 2026-08-20 as a defect: "render() returns before calling renderRiskCenter()
# for anonymous visitors, so anon users get an EMPTY Risk Center body instead of the
# lock shell; the lock-shell branch is unreachable for the audience it was written
# for." The OBSERVATION behind that report is real and reproducible — reading
# `#rc_body.innerHTML` in the console of a signed-out production page does return ''.
# The CONCLUSION is not. In both states that skip renderRiskCenter() the panel is
# display:none, and in the one anonymous state where the panel IS on screen
# (`anon-analyzed`, portfolio mode) renderAnonBook() calls renderRiskCenter() and the
# lock shell paints. Verified live 2026-08-20 on www.mastermind-x.com/watchlist.html,
# signed out, RiskCore/SD absent (the gated scripts 401 by design):
#
#   anon-empty      -> #ws_sec_rc computed display 'none', not in the layout, rc_body ''
#   after a paste   -> data-ws-state="anon-analyzed", display 'block', VISIBLE,
#                      rc_body 551 chars carrying .lockshell + "Risk reads come with
#                      a free account"
#
# So the shell is not dead and the JS needed no repair. What was missing is the PIN:
# the correctness of those early returns lives in a DIFFERENT FILE from the returns
# themselves. Delete one rule from templates/watchlist.html.j2 and the reported bug
# becomes real — an empty, VISIBLE Risk Center on the anonymous funnel surface, which
# is exactly the "empty box on the anonymous shell" regression labFallback() was
# written to end. These tests pin both halves together, so the pairing cannot be
# broken from either side, and so the next reader is not left re-deriving it from a
# console that shows only one of the two facts.

# The base SHIM answers every getElementById with null, which is correct for the pure
# logic above: render() returns at hasUI() and nothing paints. These tests need the
# opposite — the smallest real element registry that lets render() reach the panel.
