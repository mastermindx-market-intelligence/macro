    56 cap-deferred pull requests could not drain (sweep run 31311549150, 11:44:42Z:
    "0 main commit(s) classified … main proof: NO clean name at unknown-sha").

      ci.yml has no `push` trigger, so main is proven ONLY by a workflow_dispatch,
      and every main-ref dispatch shares `ci-refs/heads/main`. Each pinned session
      re-firing the documented `gh workflow run ci.yml --ref main` lever therefore
      KILLED the proof already running: 31309720615 cancelled at 44 minutes by
      31311537537, itself cancelled 4 minutes later by 31311693575.

      fences.yml is the OTHER proof merge_on_green reads, and the only one that

      and each one cancelled its predecessor (5 runs between 11:40:38Z and
      11:43:04Z). All ten runs in the sweeper's walk were `cancelled`. A run longer
      than the gap between pushes can NEVER conclude.

    So the expressions below are load-bearing, not stylistic. Reverting either to a
    flat `true` re-closes the sweeper's base-inherited-red refresh and re-pins the
    whole fleet — if this test is what is in your way, you are removing the fix.

# ─── The 2026-08-14 E2BIG transport regression (run 31775693780) ──────────────

# before executing a single test:
#

#     Argument list too long
#
# The chain: ci-plan diffed against the PR's opening base SHA; by run time main
# had advanced 45 commits and 8,581 distinct paths through the nightly bake
# window; the whole drift was attributed to the PR; and the resulting list rode
# a job output into the pack step's `env:` as CI_CHANGED_FILES_JSON — 350,264
# measured bytes against Linux's 131,072-byte MAX_ARG_STRLEN, the per-STRING cap
# execve applies before any program runs.
#
# These tests pin the TRANSPORT — the property that the list's size stops
# mattering — and the first one is the mutation proof: it fires a real execve at
# a population no environment can hold.

_E2BIG_MIN_JSON_BYTES = 2_000_000

# string did not follow it through execve, the file transport did, and the paths
# survived byte-exact across the boundary.

# ── the plan is a contract between ci-plan and twelve packs ──────────────────
#
# Wave B (2026-08-11) moved the selection decision out of main() into
# build_plan(): ci-plan publishes one hashed plan, and every pack RECOMPUTES it
# and refuses when its own hash disagrees. So the tests below are not "does the
# plan look sensible" — they are the two ways that arrangement goes silently
# wrong.
#
#   1. THE PLAN NARROWS WHEN IT HAS NO RIGHT TO. `has_work: false` skips every
#      pack, and ci-gate then publishes an affirmative success anyway (it must:
#      merge_on_green requires a real pass, because absence of red is not a pass
#      — #4779). So a plan that wrongly proves no-work merges a completely unrun
#      PR green. Every widening rule is therefore re-pinned HERE, through
#      build_plan, not only through select_jobs: the rules moved, and a rule that
#      is correct in select_jobs but unreachable from build_plan is no rule.
#   2. THE PLAN AND THE EXECUTION DISAGREE. Twelve runners each deriving the
#      partition independently is exactly the shape a nondeterministic input
#      splits, and the resulting green means nothing. The parity test walks EVERY
#      index, because a divergence that only hits pack 7 is invisible to a test
#      that checks pack 0.

    tests that want a PR plan pass ``event``/``role`` or a file list

    recomputes a different plan sha and the EXISTING `--expect-plan-sha` parity

    """The measured before/after this wave exists to produce.

    Baselines on the pre-curation manifest (PR #5585 planner, 188 jobs):
    templates/index.html 129 jobs / 6,677 weight-seconds; build_free_content.py
    129 / 6,430; engine/prophet/plan_book.py 123 / 6,416. Bounds below carry
    headroom so an unrelated job gaining or losing a scope does not red this,
    while a regression that gives the fallback tier back to the curated nine
    (~1,550 weight-seconds and three of twelve packs per shape) does.

    The templates/index.html job ceiling is 128 rather than 126 because
    `engine-render-guards` split into three lanes (#5587 on top of #5586): the
    sweep still owned-matches this probe, and the two sibling lanes
    (`express-render-guards`, `attested-history-guards`) still fallback-match
    it. That is +2 jobs / +210 weight-seconds vs the single pre-split job, not
    a return of the curated eight. Weight and pack ceilings are unchanged.

    JOB COUNTS RE-BASED +1 (129/127/121) for #5620, which added ONE new job,
    `intelligence-registry` (Eval OS T1). Measured against the pre-#5620
    manifest, it is the sole newcomer on all three probes and the ONLY delta:

        templates/index.html          128 -> 129 jobs, 5,253 -> 5,266 weight
        scripts/build_free_content.py 126 -> 127 jobs, 5,016 -> 5,029 weight
        engine/prophet/plan_book.py   120 -> 121 jobs, 5,002 -> 5,015 weight

    +13 weight-seconds per probe. The WEIGHT and PACK ceilings are deliberately
    NOT moved: they are what bound the incident this wave exists to prevent, and
    a regression that gave the fallback tier back to the curated eight would be
    ~1,550 weight-seconds and three of twelve packs — two orders of magnitude
    above this, so it still reds here. What moved is only the job count, and only
    because the previous bounds carried zero headroom on that axis: 128/126/120
    were the exact pre-#5620 measurements, so the very first honest new job
    breached all three. The docstring above promises headroom "so an unrelated
    job gaining or losing a scope does not red this"; `intelligence-registry` is
    exactly such a job, and that promise was not funded. Re-based to the new
    measurement rather than padded, so the next new job is again a visible event.

    This re-base is the same change carried by PR #5669 (authored there first).
    It is duplicated here because both fixes land in the SAME `workflow-yaml`
    job: run_ci_pack abandons a job's remaining steps on the first non-zero
    exit, so this assertion (step 5) masks `audit_unrun_tests.py` (step 12).
    A PR that healed only one of the two would leave `ci-pack-1` red and neither
    PR could ever merge — the two-partial-heals deadlock. Whichever lands second
    resolves to an identical tree.

    JOB COUNTS LOWERED to 127/124/119 (wave 3, 2026-08-14). The re-base above
    absorbed TWO newcomers on the two code probes, and only one of them was
    evidence. `intelligence-registry` matched on the DECLARED tier and stands.
    `options-estate-guards` matched on the FALLBACK tier: #5634 gave it
    tests/test_options_gap_discipline.py, an opaque construct in that suite's
    closure widened it to whole-tree scan roots, and it began selecting on
    files it does not read. That is smear, so it is curated away at the source
    (`scope: exclusive` in the manifest) rather than paid for here.

    Re-measured on the curated manifest, `options-estate-guards` is the sole
    delta and the ONLY job that leaves any probe:

        templates/index.html          127 -> 126 jobs, 5,259 -> 5,235 weight
        scripts/build_free_content.py 124 -> 123 jobs, 5,009 -> 4,985 weight
        engine/prophet/plan_book.py   119 -> 118 jobs, 5,001 -> 4,977 weight

    The ceilings are set at measurement + 1, not at measurement. The #5620
    re-base note above diagnosed zero headroom as the defect — "the very first
    honest new job breached all three" — and then re-based exact, funding the
    docstring's headroom promise with nothing again. One job of slack absorbs
    the next honest newcomer and still makes the second a visible event. Note
    the pre-curation measurements had already drifted BELOW the 129/127/121
    ceilings as later curation waves landed, so those bounds carried accidental
    slack of 2-3 jobs; this restores a ratchet that is tight on purpose.

    WEIGHT and PACK ceilings are again deliberately NOT moved, for the reason
    given above: they bound the incident, and a fallback-tier regression is
    ~1,550 weight-seconds — two orders of magnitude above the 24 removed here.

    JOB COUNT RE-BASED +2 on templates/index.html only (129, 2026-08-15).
    ``engine/china_intel_interest.py`` lazy-imports ``china_intel_hub``, and
    that hub's opaque constructs smear ``templates/**`` onto two inferred
    jobs that already imported ``build_china_library`` /
    ``china_standout_track`` (``cn-standout-audit``,
    ``coiled-mtf-anchor-era``). Measured 126 → 128 on this probe; the other
    two probes are unchanged. Weight and pack ceilings stay. Exclusive
    curation of those two jobs is the smear-at-source fix, but their
    closures run through ``build_china_library`` and would be a third
    exclusive-scope wave, not this packing-contract heal.

    THAT DEFERRAL IS NOW PAID (wave 4, 2026-08-15). Both jobs are curated
    ``scope: exclusive`` in the manifest, and the ceiling above comes back
    DOWN from 129 to 127. Neither job had an owned tier at all before this —
    every one of their 28 inferred patterns was opaque fallback, so they
    selected on ``*`` and on whole trees no suite in them reads. Re-measured
    on the curated manifest, they are the ONLY delta and NOTHING was added to
    any probe:

        templates/index.html          128 -> 126 jobs, 5,310 -> 5,292 weight
        scripts/build_free_content.py 123 -> 122 jobs, 5,044 -> 5,038 weight
        engine/prophet/plan_book.py   118 -> 118 jobs, 5,040 -> 5,040 weight

    Both jobs leave templates/index.html; only ``coiled-mtf-anchor-era``
    leaves build_free_content.py, because ``cn-standout-audit`` KEEPS
    ``scripts/**`` on the declared tier — two of its suites rglob that tree
    and AST-scan every hit for unlaned CN sink calls, so the tree is their
    subject and narrowing it would be the silent-stop failure this file's
    coverage test exists to prevent. Both keep ``engine/**`` for the same
    kind of reason, which is why plan_book.py does not move at all. That is
    the shape a correct curation has: it removes the fallback claims and
    keeps every earned one.

    The ceiling is set at measurement + 1 per the wave-3 note above, so 126
    measured -> 127. Note this lands exactly where wave 3 had it before
    #5754, which is the confirmation that these two jobs were the whole of
    that +2 and that no other drift hid inside the re-base. WEIGHT and PACK
    ceilings are again NOT moved: the 18 weight-seconds removed here are two
    orders of magnitude below the ~1,550 a fallback-tier regression costs,
    and packs were 9 on every probe before and after.

    JOB COUNT RE-BASED +1 on engine/prophet/plan_book.py only (120, wave 6,
    2026-08-20 main-red-repair). Measured against the last lane-green main
    commit (d972484c6474): baseline selects 119/195 jobs for this probe;
    the current manifest selects 120/196, and diffing the two selected-job
    NAME sets (not just counts) isolates the entire delta to one job,
    ``reference-integrity`` — present in both manifests, but newly matching
    this probe. #6122 (XPV2-SC-R3A, commit f4305a4485f6) added a third step
    to that already-existing job (`tests/test_xpv2_sector_r3_fixture.py`,
    over the frozen Sector Central fixture), and that suite's import closure
    carries several ``dynamic import`` / ``subprocess invocation``
    ambiguities several hops deep (engine/alert_triage.py,
    engine/codex_lane/runner.py) that resolve to CODE_SCAN_ROOTS/
    SUBPROCESS_ROOTS, which include ``engine/**`` — hence the new match on
    engine/prophet/plan_book.py specifically, not anything Sector Central or
    Prophet actually share.

    This is NOT curated away like serving-observability's smear (2026-08-20
    main-red-repair, same wave) or curated like dataos-identity-seams was
    REJECTED (wave 2 note above): reference-integrity's own header comment
    documents it as deliberately unscoped — "Unscoped on purpose: L7/L8/L9
    are namespace and coupling closures over mockups/design_system,
    research/migration_packets and the page registry, so a diff that adds a
    file anywhere in those roots must re-run this" — a whole-tree RIG V1
    reference-integrity gate that already existed pre-#6122 and is meant to
    fire broadly. Declaring `scope: exclusive` on a job whose real purpose is
    "catch reference laundering anywhere in these wide namespaces" would
    either lie about coverage or degenerate straight back to the fallback
    breadth it already carries — the identical failure mode
    dataos-identity-seams was rejected for. One extra match on an
    already-broad, already-reviewed, always-on gate costs nothing over the
    ~1,550 weight-seconds/3-pack fallback-regression bound this file guards;
    ratcheting the ceiling is the correct-risk response, not curation.
    WEIGHT and PACK ceilings stay unmoved (5,600 / 9 packs, unchanged).

    JOB COUNTS RE-BASED to 129/125/121 (wave 7, 2026-08-21) — a ratchet on the
    templates probe, and the wave-3 headroom promise re-funded on all three.
    Measured against the last commit at which this job's own lane was green
    (48bfd3c97e8a, data-health run 32380507121), diffing the selected-job NAME
    sets isolates one sole entrant per probe and nothing leaves:

        templates/index.html          127 -> 128 jobs, 5,390 -> 5,420 weight
        scripts/build_free_content.py 123 -> 124 jobs, 5,141 -> 5,173 weight
        engine/prophet/plan_book.py   119 -> 120 jobs, 5,143 -> 5,175 weight

    Only templates/index.html BREACHED (128 > 127). Its sole entrant is
    ``regwall-boundary``, the new ``gate: code`` job #6141 added so that
    tests/test_regwall_json_gate.py — whose only CI home had been the
    ``gate: data`` job ``tier-gate``, i.e. off the merge gate entirely — can
    actually block a merge. It matches on the DECLARED tier, not fallback:
    #6141 gave it an explicit ``scope: exclusive`` + ``paths:`` precisely
    because that suite names its subjects as segment literals
    (``REPO_ROOT / "templates" / "index.html"``, tests/test_regwall_json_gate.py:102),
    which SCOPE_REFERENCE_RE cannot see. So this is the ``intelligence-registry``
    case verbatim (wave 3 note above), not the ``options-estate-guards`` smear:
    there is no fallback claim to curate away, because the job arrived already
    curated to the narrowest honest scope it has. Narrowing it further would
    drop ``templates/index.html`` from the declaration of the one job whose
    entire purpose is to assert the regwall boundary inside that file — a
    silent false green, and ``curated_exclusive_closure_findings`` would hard-
    fail the manifest for it anyway. Ratcheting is the correct-risk response.

    The other two probes did NOT breach — but both sat at EXACTLY their
    ceiling (124/124 and 120/120), which is the zero-headroom defect the #5620
    note above already diagnosed once ("the very first honest new job breached
    all three") and which wave 6 re-introduced by re-basing plan_book exact.
    That is how this red reached main unseen: ``workflow-yaml`` is itself
    ``gate: data``, so under W2 of
    research/CI_MERGE_GATE_RELIABILITY_ROOT_CAUSE_2026_08_19.md this assertion
    is packed only by data-health.yml, which has no ``pull_request`` trigger —
    no PR can be blocked by it, so a zero-headroom ceiling does not red the
    newcomer's PR, it reds MAIN, silently, one commit later. All three are
    therefore set at measurement + 1 per the wave-3 rule, restoring the one
    job of slack that makes the NEXT newcomer a visible event rather than a
    fait accompli. WEIGHT and PACK ceilings stay unmoved (5,800 / 5,600 /
    5,600 and 10 packs): weights are 5,420 / 5,173 / 5,175, and a fallback-
    tier regression is still ~1,550 weight-seconds above them, so the bound
    this file exists to hold is untouched.

    JOB COUNTS RE-BASED to 131/127/122 (wave 8, 2026-08-28, TP-1 repair edge
    theme-parity-tp1-canada-20260828-sol-001). Measured on main a8075391fa89,
    diffing selected-job NAME sets per probe against the wave-7 green
    baseline manifest (48bfd3c97e8a):

        templates/index.html          130 jobs / 5,560 weight (was ceiling 129)
          entrants: regwall-boundary (declared — wave 7's own funded entrant),
                    design-governance (fallback, w16),
                    board-shadow-substrate (fallback, w7)
        scripts/build_free_content.py 126 jobs / 5,313 weight (was ceiling 125)
          entrants: design-governance, board-shadow-substrate,
                    reference-integrity (all fallback)
        engine/prophet/plan_book.py   121 jobs / 5,299 weight (AT ceiling —
          the zero-headroom defect again)
          entrants: board-shadow-substrate, reference-integrity

    Every unfunded entrant is a DELIBERATELY-UNSCOPED always-on gate, i.e.
    the ``reference-integrity`` class wave 6 already adjudicated ("ratcheting
    the ceiling is the correct-risk response, not curation"):
    ``design-governance`` is TP-0's forward-only design ratchet (#6579) —
    a diff gate over user-facing templates/site whose entire purpose is to
    run on exactly the PRs these probes model, so its match on
    templates/index.html is its subject, not smear; ``board-shadow-substrate``
    documents itself "Left UNSCOPED … always-on is correct for this job, not
    lazy" (its K6 kill is a repo-wide string walk inference cannot narrow);
    ``reference-integrity``'s breadth was adjudicated in wave 6 and its
    growth onto build_free_content.py is the same mockups/research/registry
    namespace closure firing as designed. Curating any of the three
    ``scope: exclusive`` would lie about coverage or degenerate back to
    fallback breadth — the dataos-identity-seams rejection, verbatim. The
    non-smear finding is affirmative: TP-1's own manifest edit (adding
    tests/test_stock_dashboard_css.py to the render-guard step, merge
    e2091032ad1f) adds ZERO probe matches — the selected-name-set delta
    across that merge is empty on all three probes, so the earned Canada CSS
    coverage rides a job that already owned-matched its subjects and costs
    these ceilings nothing.

    Ceilings are set at measurement + 1 per the wave-3 rule (131/127/122),
    re-funding the headroom promise on all three axes — plan_book.py sat AT
    its ceiling again, the exact silent-main-red mechanism the wave-7 note
    describes. WEIGHT and PACK ceilings stay unmoved (5,800 / 5,600 / 5,600
    and 10 packs): measured weights are 5,560 / 5,313 / 5,299 and a
    fallback-tier regression is still ~1,550 weight-seconds above them.
    The companion test below pins all three always-on gates so the OPPOSITE
    regression — a future curation silently narrowing a deliberate whole-tree
    gate off its subject — reds loudly instead of shipping a false green.
