"""Ratchet: no NEW code may deflate a Sharpe by a caller-asserted literal n_trials.

The honest multiple-testing N must come from the Trial Ledger (counted at generation),
not from a number the caller picks and can lowball. Enforcing that on all ~45 existing
callers at once would be a flag-day; instead this test FREEZES the current offenders in
an allowlist that can only ever SHRINK. A new file (or a newly-added literal call in a
previously-clean file) that calls ``deflated_sharpe`` without ``ledger=`` fails the
build. Migrating a file to the ledger (dropping its literal calls) is always allowed.

This is the enforced invariant the whole autonomy argument rests on — see
research/SELF_IMPROVING_AI_SUITE.md (P3, "the keystone"). To migrate a file: pass
``ledger=<TrialLedger>`` + ``family=`` to deflated_sharpe, log the full grid at
generation, then delete that file's entry from ``LEGACY_LITERAL_NTRIALS`` below.
