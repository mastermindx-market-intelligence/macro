"""tests/test_prophet_bridge_order_invariance.py — the bridge intake is order-invariant.

`engine.prophet_bridge.select_candidates` reads `us_standouts.json["buy"]` and returns a
ranked candidate sample (or the full ordering with ``n=None``). Its sort key was
`(-score, -act_level)`, which is NOT a
total order: any two rows tied on both legs were left in the ARTIFACT's incoming order by
Python's stable sort. That made the intake silently producer-dependent — a board re-emitted
with `buy[]` in a different order could produce a DIFFERENT sample on identical data. The
fix appends `ticker` as the final key. Live origination now requests ``n=None`` and is
lossless, but deterministic order remains a contract for rank display and research slices.

Everything here shuffles the INPUT and asserts the OUTPUT does not move; the source itself
contains no shuffling. Three things are pinned:

  A. Order stability   — the returned ticker sequence is byte-identical across seeds.
  B. Cutoff membership — when more rows tie than fit in `n`, WHICH rows survive `[:n]` is
                         also fixed (the failure that actually changes what gets traded).
  C. Key precedence    — ticker is the LAST key: score still beats act_level, and act_level
                         still beats ticker. A ticker leg promoted too early would pass A+B
                         while silently re-ranking the board.

Plus a counterfactual (`TestTheFixtureCanSeeTheDefect`) that runs the OLD two-leg key over the
same shuffles and asserts it DOES drift — without it, A and B would pass on a fixture whose
rows never actually tie, and the test would be pinning nothing.
