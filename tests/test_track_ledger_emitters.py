"""tests/test_track_ledger_emitters.py — the four Track-record popup ledger emitters
(track_ledger/v1). Covers, per market: schema/v1 shape, compact row keys, status
vocabulary, matured-vs-early marking, locked/suspended flags, truncation disclosure,
JSON round-trip (the numpy-scalar trap), and summary consistency with rows.

House law: NEVER write real data/ or site/ stores (MM_DATA_GUARD kills the build on
store mutation). Every store root here is a monkeypatched tmp_path; the US/CN emitters
are driven with patched price/board sources; the HK/CA path is exercised through the
pure engine.track_ledger.from_board_ledger_grade() converter (no I/O at all).
