"""tests/test_marketing_sentinel.py — Deterministic Sentinel W1 gate tests.

All file writes go to tmp_path — NEVER to repo data/ (MM_DATA_GUARD tripwire).

Coverage:
  - near-dup across accounts caught; same account NOT sentinel's job
  - shared chart_id across accounts quarantined
  - cadence: 5 items one account cap=4 → 5th quarantined
  - 3 items same cashtag → 3rd quarantined
  - slot collision
  - advice_lexicon phrase hit
  - advice_lexicon pattern hit ("will hit $200")
  - missing_disclosure on signal item
  - cherry-pick: window has loss + plan shows only win receipts → quarantine
  - cherry-pick: loss ticker present in plan receipts → pass
  - cherry-pick: window None → skipped recorded
  - stale receipts: age > max → plan refused, all items quarantined
  - stale receipts: age None → only receipt items quarantined
  - stale receipts: age within → no effect
  - kill-switch: publish_enabled() False by default; True with env "1"
  - account disabled → items quarantined even with exception
  - exception restores lexicon-quarantined item; does NOT restore account_disabled
  - auditor_strict=False → warnings annotated, not quarantined (except always-enforced)
  - de-escalation invariant: gate never changes type/headline/body
  - report counts consistent: passed + quarantined == items
  - reasons_histogram populated
  - self-contained quarantined entries carry account+headline+reasons
  - run_gate: reads plan+cfg from tmp tree, writes both artifacts atomically
  - POST-TIME gates (ported from #3928): per-account template-frame repeats, the
    no-ticker filler cap (plan side AND publish side), and the substance floor —
    each unit-tested and each proven to run through the live publisher

# POST-TIME GATES (ported from PR #3928, adapted to the W1 pipeline 2026-07-29)
#
# Three gates that run at PUBLISH time, not plan time, over ONE account's
# same-day posted history. #3928's other halves (consequence.py, the template
# bank rewrites) are obsolete under the W1 no-fallback law — the bank no longer
# ships planned copy anywhere — but these three are lane-independent post-time
# checks that gate_plan structurally cannot perform, because an account's day is
# assembled from lanes that never share a plan.
#
# EVERY GATE HERE IS PROVEN TO RUN. The unit sections pin the arithmetic; the
# publisher section drives the real scripts/marketing_publisher.main() over a
# fixture clock and asserts the ledger, so reverting a call site turns these red
# rather than leaving a tested function nothing calls.
