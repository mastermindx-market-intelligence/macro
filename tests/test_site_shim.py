"""Data-base shim regression — every site page must carry the R2 fetch shim.

The bug (nearly shipped in #1045): standalone page builders (documented usage
``python -m scripts.build_baskets``) rendered pages WITHOUT the data-base shim —
it was only added by the separate post-render step scripts/inject_data_base.py.
Committing a standalone builder's output silently stripped
``<script data-dbase src="data_base.js">`` and regressed the R2 rerouting of the
heavy per-ticker fetches. Fix: all builders write through lib.pages.write_page,
which injects the depth-aware tag at write time; the post-render sweep stays as
the idempotent safety net.

Three layers here:
  1. unit tests for lib.pages (inject_text / dbase_prefix / write_page)
  2. a repo tripwire — every COMMITTED site/**/*.html carries the marker, so a
     future write path that bypasses write_page fails CI the moment its output
     is committed
  3. a source guard — no scripts/engine module writes a literal *.html target
     with raw write_text

Run: .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_site_shim.py -q
