"""tests/test_email_segments.py — app/email_segments.py (SEE W4, gate G3).

The segment definitions are a PAIR — a SQL fragment for the admin console's
Management-API lane and a Python predicate for the sweeper's PostgREST/GoTrue lane —
because the two planes hold different secrets and cannot run each other's query. Two
hand-maintained copies of one membership rule is how a compliance gate rots: the CSV
export would say 412 and the send would reach 419, and nobody would notice until seven of
the extra were the seven who unsubscribed.

So this suite asserts the pair agrees, and it asserts the one thing G3 actually promises:
``marketing_eligible`` excludes suppressed addresses and opted-out users BY CONSTRUCTION,
in BOTH renderings — not by a filter a caller has to remember to apply.

Fully offline: no database, no network, no admin state. Every assertion is over strings
and pure functions.
