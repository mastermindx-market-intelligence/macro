"""Pure-function tests for the 13F smart-money TRADE TRACKER (engine.manager_trades).

No network. The price-dependent math is exercised against a tiny in-memory close
panel (a fake breadth frame + a fake SPY series), so excess-return, direction-aware
quality, the per-fund scorecard, and the leaderboard z-grade are all asserted without
disk. A final smoke test runs compute_tracker against the committed snapshots if they
are present, else skips.
