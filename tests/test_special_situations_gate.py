"""The Special Situations tier gate — the split IS the boundary.

Two layers, deliberately:

* the SPLIT LOGIC is proven hermetically (fake rows, real templates), so the
  contract holds even before a render lane has rebaked the desk;
* the SHIPPED BYTES are then checked against the same invariant — no row that
  the paid payload carries may also sit in the free shell.

The second layer skips (loudly) until the desk has been rebaked in the gated
shape, because the baked page on main lags a template change by one render.
