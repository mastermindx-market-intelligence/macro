"""Tests for forward-chained calibration, honest evaluation, and the append-only ledgers.

The suite is built around ONE property and the ways it can silently break:

* :func:`test_no_later_prediction_enters_the_fit` constructs the folds and proves,
  key by key, that a scored prediction is never in its own training set — an
  assertion on the receipts, not on a comment;
* :func:`test_leakage_simulation_against_a_deliberately_leaking_variant` plants a
  regime break in a synthetic stream and scores it twice: once forward-chained,
  once with a calibrator fit on the WHOLE stream.  The leaking variant reports a
  materially better post-break Brier that was never available at decision time,
  and the test pins the direction of that gap.  A leak makes results look BETTER,
  so a test that only checks "calibration improves the score" would pass on the
  bug it is supposed to catch;
* the null tests assert that an unestimable metric comes back NAMED rather than
  as a default — the trap is a 0.5 or a missing key that a downstream reader
  treats as a measurement;
* the ledger tests assert byte-level file stability across a replay, because
  "append-only" is a property of the FILE, not of the function's intent.

Everything is synthetic and offline.  Nothing outside ``tmp_path`` is written.
