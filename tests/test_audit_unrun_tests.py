"""The unrun-test census: it must see suites wherever they live, and only suites.

WHAT THIS PINS.  `scripts/audit_unrun_tests.py` owns test discovery for all three
darkness guards (`check_skip_only_suites.py` and `check_ci_trigger_closure.py` both
import from it rather than re-implementing the repo layout).  Until 2026-08-06 that
discovery was `TESTS.glob("test_*.py")` — hard-scoped to `tests/` — so a suite
written anywhere else was invisible to every census at once.

WHY THAT SCOPE WAS EXACTLY BACKWARDS.  Research packets here are routinely fenced to
files-only, so a packet's guard suite gets written NEXT TO its instrument under
`research/` instead of in `tests/`.  Those are the suites most likely to be dark, and
they were the ones no census could see: measured in #4693,
`research/prophet_us_audit/test_label_grading_battery.py` (16 tests) and
`research/signal_engine/test_buy_filters.py` (6 tests) had been named by no `run:`
step since they landed, while every census reported the repo covered.

THE OTHER HALF, AND WHY IT IS A TEST AND NOT A COMMENT.  Widening by FILENAME would
have replaced a blind census with a noisy one: three `test_`-shaped files under
`research/` are CLI measurement instruments that collect zero tests, and `pytest`
exits 5 on each.  Reporting those as unrun work items is how a census stops being
read — the failure mode `check_ci_trigger_closure.py`'s docstring says these guards
exist to end.  So classification asks pytest's question (does the file define a
`test*` function, or a `Test*` class holding one), and the tests below pin BOTH
directions against real collection.
