"""The options family must keep EXPRESS-LANE coverage — the #3515 freeze class.

OIP E8 (2026-07-29).  ``scripts/build_options_command.py`` builds options.html, the
canonical options surface, by re-serialising six stores other builders write.  It was
wired in ``daily.yml`` ONLY.  Consequences:

1. **Baked-page freeze.**  Every express render (``render.yml`` push/dispatch,
   ``engine-render.yml`` on an ``engine/**`` push) refreshed stores the workspace reads —
   ``site/gex/*.json`` and ``site/vol/regime.json`` in ``cl_gex``,
   ``site/flowleaders/leaders.json`` in ``flowleaders()`` — and then committed a
   ``site/options.html`` still describing the previous nightly.  Identical class to
   ``build_flow_leaders`` (#3515) and ``build_research_vault`` (#3487): a page whose
   builder lives in one lane while its inputs refresh in three.
2. **Un-bakeable edits.**  An edit to the builder or ``templates/options.html.j2``
   resolved through ``region_of``'s catch-all to ``all`` — and ``scope=all`` did not run
   the builder either, so the fix simply never shipped until the next nightly.
3. **Screener page, same hole.**  ``build_options_screener`` (which writes both
   ``options_screener.html`` and the workspace's Scanner payload
   ``site/screenerdata/rows.json``) was absent from BOTH express lanes.
4. **Narrow-vs-cluster drift.**  The narrow ``gex)`` case refreshed the skew and ivspread
   snapshots but never re-ran ``build_options_entry_state``, which consumes them — so
   ``data/options_entry/state.parquet`` stayed a generation behind its own inputs.

The load-bearing assertion is :func:`test_every_workspace_store_producer_is_accounted_for`:
it reads ``load_stores`` out of the builder and forces a wiring decision for every store
the workspace reads.  Add a seventh store and this test reds until you either wire its
producer into the express lanes or record it as an accepted committed-vintage input.

``region_of`` is EXECUTED, not grepped — the picker is inline shell, i.e. untested code
unless a test runs it (the tests/test_render_canada_scope.py precedent).

    CI packs install a minimal dep set, not requirements.txt.  When the owning job
    (`workflow-yaml` in .github/ci/legacy-jobs.yml) installed only `pytest pyyaml`, a bare
    `import scripts.build_options_command` died with ModuleNotFoundError before the probe
    ran — that module does `from jinja2 import Environment, FileSystemLoader` at module
    scope — so this ONE test was green in every dev venv and red only in ci-pack-1 (#3977).

    That job's install line now carries jinja2 for this suite's four siblings, whose
    assertions genuinely need it.  This helper stays anyway, and deliberately: it is what
    lets the express-lane suite run on nothing but pytest + bash, which is the dependency
    tier its OTHER 30 tests actually sit at (they read workflow YAML and shell out to
    render.yml's `region_of`).  Do not replace it with `importorskip` if the deps move
    again — a suite that skips in the only job naming it executes NOWHERE while reading
    green, the class scripts/check_skip_only_suites.py runs in this very job to catch, and
    this probe is the only guard that sees an f-string-built store path.

    Stubbing is safe here because load_stores() and _load() are pure stdlib (json +
    pathlib); jinja2 is touched only by render()'s `Environment(...)`
    (build_options_command.py:863), which this test never calls.  Two properties keep the

      * installed ONLY when jinja2 is genuinely absent, so any env that has it — CI
        included, today — probes against the real module;
      * its attributes RAISE when called, so nothing can quietly render an empty page
