"""The §7 signal-date family: `date` / `signal_date` / `confirmed_date` / `recorded_at`.

A marker has THREE dates and a provenance stamp, and before 2026-08-08 only one of them
had a name. `date` is the 3D bucket's OPEN label (R-SQ2); the bucket's own close lands up
to two sessions later; the buy-filter LABEL is not knowable for ~8 daily sessions. Three
surfaces each read a different one as "the signal date" — the chart marker, the Golden
Oracle panel, and the early-dot lane — with no field saying which was which. Measured on
the committed 2026-08-07 NVDA file: `date` 2026-08-05, bucket close 2026-08-07, buy-filter
label still pending.

THE FENCE these tests exist for (the outage class). `daily.yml` was dead 2026-08-03..08-06
and artifacts published days after the sessions they describe. A signal evaluated N days
late must still be dated by its OWN bucket close — never by the run that happened to
evaluate it. That is the per-date-ledger-can-still-be-run-date-stamped defect, and
`test_signal_date_is_the_bucket_close_never_the_run_date` /
`test_a_late_run_moves_only_recorded_at` are written to go RED if the run date ever leaks
into a signal anchor.

Network-free: real NYSE sessions (the era `sq-abs-session-2026-08-06` grid is cut on the
absolute session calendar, so a `pd.bdate_range` fixture would not reproduce production's
bucket composition — see tests/test_signal_quality_no_leak.py).
