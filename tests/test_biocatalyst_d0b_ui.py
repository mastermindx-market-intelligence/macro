"""BC-D0b — the premium trial product: stance, two clocks, and bilingual parity.

These are source-level contract tests over the shipped browser assets. They
exist because the BC-D0a reference pack was rejected on four named defects
(`research/BIOCATALYST_D0A_DESIGN_ADJUDICATION_2026-08-06.md` §2), and a later
visual refactor must not be able to reintroduce any of them quietly:

* D1 — a ZH surface carrying raw English field names and state enums.
* D2 — a surface that shows state and never answers "so what do I do".
* D3 — a constant reprinted on every row instead of once in the footer.
* D4 — a graphic with no axis, no units, and no stated reading.
* D5 — the five evidence cues occupying the widest Tier-1 band as a grid.
