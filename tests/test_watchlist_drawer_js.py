"""tests/test_watchlist_drawer_js.py — the W4 per-ticker Intelligence Drawer.

W4 composes a per-name drawer out of artifacts that already exist. The composer is
`templates/watchlist_risk.js` (gated — it never reaches an anonymous visitor); the two
callers are `templates/portfolio.js` (holdings) and `templates/watchlist.js` (watchlist).

What this file pins is the class of defect a drawer is uniquely good at hiding: a
section that renders NOTHING and a section that has nothing to report are the same
pixels, and only one of them is information. Every gate below exists because the
failure it catches would look like success in a screenshot.

  1. HONEST ABSENCE, as a mechanism. Every section builder is run over an EMPTY payload
     and must return a row that names what is missing. A builder that returns '' would
     silently shorten the drawer, and the reviewer would see a clean drawer rather than
     a missing one. This is the gate the wave's "no fabricated values, no silent
     empties" acceptance row cashes out to.
  2. NO FABRICATION on the same empty payload — an absent section may not print a figure.
  3. ATTRIBUTE ESCAPING in the row painter. Tips ride `data-tip-en="…"`; a read carrying
     a quote used to break OUT of the attribute rather than print a stray tag, which is
     a silent failure in exactly the slot where nobody looks.
  4. The STANCE precedence, and that its three words are byte-identical to the copy
     portfolio.js holds — one vocabulary living in two files across the gate boundary.
  5. GLANCE-TIER VOCABULARY. Tier 1 may not carry ENB / MCTR / WRI / lane / study names.
  6. The DOSSIER ROUTE. `stock.html` reads `location.hash` only; the shipped watchlist
     drawer linked `stock.html?t=<T>`, which is a 200 that opens an empty dossier — a
     dead link no link checker can see.
  7. The ANONYMOUS drawer: a lock shell, and zero gated reads.
  8. `entry_signal.action` — an engine string written as an instruction ("take a half
     position here") — never reaches a holdings surface.
  9. The W3 residual: the falling-days claim may not assert a change while printing the
     same number twice.

Same harness as its three sibling suites: these modules are browser IIFEs, node-shelled
behind minimal window/document stubs with readyState 'loading' so init() never runs.

    It is not that number. `ext.grade` grades `ext_z` — the z-score of that same gap

    the number is raw. Measured over the 1,621 artifacts carrying `tech.pct_vs_200dma`,

    raw gap. The committed crops are one such pair (AAPL "in line" at +9.0%, RIVN "well
    above" at +8.9%), so a reader comparing two drawers reads the surface as broken.

    Cure: the number leads as a plain fact of its own, and the word follows behind the
