"""tests/test_prophet_anticipation_intake.py — ANTICIPATION A1 + §6.9 R3 acceptance.

WHAT THIS PINS
--------------
The two halves of the US Prophet intake change, each named for the case it was
chartered by:

  A1  status-class admission (the patience cohort can originate a plan at all), the
      recorded down-direction refusal, the era + admission-class stamps, the frozen
      legacy shadow ledger and its production-call-path lane gate, and the
      publication-lag property.
  R3  structure-anchored entry zones on every plan — the NVDA wait_reset acceptance,
      the ADAM reset-band acceptance, and the V-bottom zone-with-expiry-to-starter
      conversion — plus the EARLY-TURN starter tier's context conditioning.

FIXTURE DISCIPLINE
------------------
Nothing here is anchored to the wall clock: every artifact date and run asof is
supplied by the test, so no case can date-bomb (the #5065 pattern).  The synthetic
price series are shaped for the property under test and named for the shape.  The
one exception is the committed-artifact disposition test, which is explicitly a read
of tonight's board and SKIPS when the artifact is absent.
