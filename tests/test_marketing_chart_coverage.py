"""tests/test_marketing_chart_coverage.py — every ticker post carries a chart.

Pins the 2026-07-28 defect the operator reported from the Outbox: four queued
posts, all naming a ticker, none carrying an illustration —

    "$LKFN chart I keep coming back to  …  mine's on the chart."   (no chart)
    "Radar check on $CVI — near entry. Nothing's triggered."       (no chart)

Four independent causes, one per section below:

  1. content_plan charted ONLY `type == "signal"`, so the `chart`, `watchlist`
     and `receipt` types were structurally incapable of carrying an image.
  2. The live-price gate VETOED the chart instead of choosing its variant, so an
     item about to be demoted signal→watchlist lost its card on the way.
  3. chart_render read daily bars from data/stocks/ alone (232 large caps) while
     Prophet picks its signals from data/baskets/ohlcv/ (2,758 names) — 30 of the
     43 tickers in the plan, including all four the operator saw, had no bars
     anywhere marketing could find them.
  4. The chart_id was deduped GLOBALLY, so the first desk to chart a ticker
     locked every other desk out of it.

The operator's law: a post that names a ticker gets a chart. Only a post with no
ticker (education / macro / a company event) may ship text-only.

    entire history: 0 receipt posts in the outbox's 570 rows, because a receipt
    slot drew from the live-signal pool and could never join a graded receipt.

    Once receipt slots draw from the RESOLVED pool, "never chart an invalidated

    # nothing twice over: this file's lanes install pandas/numpy but NOT pillow,

    # unavailable — no PNG"), returned b"", and the test asserted PNG magic bytes
    # against an empty string. Its importorskip named numpy, which the renderer
    # does not use, so the guard could not even skip itself out of the way.
