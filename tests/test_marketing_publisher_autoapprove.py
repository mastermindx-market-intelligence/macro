"""tests/test_marketing_publisher_autoapprove.py — W1 wiring-layer tests.

Covers the auto-approve gate added to scripts/marketing_publisher.py plus the
writeless dry-run report entrypoint and the admin marketing.publisher() shape.

Mirrors tests/test_marketing_social_publisher.py conventions: tmp_path for all
I/O, injected now= for determinism, ZERO live network (a fully fake publisher),
and the engine/runner modules imported INSIDE each test function.

Auto-approve contract under test:
  * config OFF and flag OFF        → NO queued→approved mutation
  * flag ON (live)                 → queued items passing ALL gates → approved
  * config ON (live)               → same, via config not flag
  * DRY-RUN + auto-approve         → reports what it WOULD approve, mutates NOTHING
  * an item failing a gate (over-280, no channel, over cap) is NOT auto-approved
  * dry_run_report() makes NO ledger writes (ledger byte-identical before/after)
  * admin marketing.publisher() returns the frozen shape and NEVER echoes a token

#:
#: This suite's copy says "today" and "into the close" — a dozen fixtures do —
#: and the publisher's clock gate now refuses a today-class word whose fact
#: session is not the posting session. Pinned to a Sunday, this suite asserted
#: that posting Friday's tape as "today" on a weekend is normal, which is the
#: exact defect the gate exists for (ob-2026-08-01-a83c188711, "$AMZN +15.3%
#: today", written 21:49Z on a Saturday). DO NOT move it back to a weekend to
#: make a failure go away — a weekend clock here means the fixture is wrong,

#: Distinct bodies for the multi-item cap / floor fixtures below. They used to be
#: "First queued post here." / "Second queued post here." / ... — one template
#: with an ordinal swapped, which the ported template-frame gate (2026-07-29)
#: scores at exactly 0.60 and quarantines, correctly: blank the numbers and those
#: three strings differ by one token in five. Varying an ordinal is NOT varying a
#: post, and that is the whole point of the gate. Each entry here is a different
#: sentence about a different thing, so these fixtures exercise the CAP and the
#: FLOOR they were written for instead of dying on a copy gate.
#:
#: DELIBERATELY TICKER-FREE. _seed_queued_item builds `kind="signal"` items, and
#: signal is a price kind: give one a cashtag and the LIVE TAPE GATE holds it for
#: want of a fresh quote, which is a second way to fail these tests for a reason
#: they are not about. Max pairwise frame similarity across these four is 0.12.

    exception key so publish-time-lane items of those kinds auto-approve even
    while require_approval stays true and auto_approve stays false.

    auto_approve_scope: "all" HERE ON PURPOSE, and it is not the product default.
    The live default is "kinds" (Content Studio W1, masterplan §7: the global
    flag no longer clears nightly planned kinds — they wait for an operator
    decision). Every test in this file predates that split and exercises the
    auto-approve MACHINERY — gates, caps, floor, jitter, immediates — on a plain
    content_studio signal, so they pin the unrestricted blanket explicitly and
    keep testing what they were written to test. The scope's own semantics
    (planned kind NOT auto-approved, mover still auto-approved) are pinned in
    tests/test_marketing_selection.py.

    APPROVAL DESK OFF, EXPLICITLY. `approval_desk.enabled` ships TRUE and a
    MISSING block reads as enabled, so a minimal config like this one arms the
    autonomous desk — which now runs UPSTREAM of the auto-approve pass and
    audits every queued planned-kind item (payload, number sanity, liveness,
    chart law, banned language, dedup). Every fixture in this file is a
    throwaway string ("Fresh post now.", "Leave this one alone.", 300 x's) that
    the desk's payload floor correctly quarantines for carrying no number, no
    cashtag and no dated precedent.

    Same reasoning as the `auto_approve_scope: all` line below: this file
    exercises the auto-approve MACHINERY — gates, caps, floor, jitter,
    immediates, post-now, dark desks — and pinning its fixtures to the desk's
    editorial bar would make sixteen unrelated tests fail the day somebody
    tightens a check. The desk's own behaviour, and its interaction with these
    lanes (planned item approved and dispatched in one sweep; breaking and
    mover untouched), is pinned in tests/test_marketing_approval_desk.py.
