"""tests/test_close_pass_host_runner.py — the close pass's host-native PRIMARY clock.

The lane this guards is ``scripts/close_pass_host_runner.py``, fired by
``com.macro.closepass`` at 13:00 local (PT) = 16:00 ET in both DST regimes. It
replaced GitHub cron as the product clock because cron measured 27 minutes of
schedule drift plus a 95-minute queue wait on 2026-08-14 and published the board
at ~19:20 ET against a 16:15 ET target.

WHAT IS PINNED HERE, and why each one is a defect somebody could actually ship:

  SINGLE INSTANCE   a manual kickstart over a running pass must EXIT CLEAN, not
                    race the same worktree with a second reset --hard.
  FAST EXIT         a holiday costs one interpreter start — no fetch, no venv,
                    no publish. The saving is the point; the ordering is the test.
  DEGRADE           ``engine.close_pass.massive_close`` (PR-A) may not exist in
                    the checkout. Absent means publish NOW, never wait forever.
  THE WAIT          every branch PROCEEDS. This function chooses when, never
                    whether, which is what makes being wrong survivable.
  RECEIPT           the run's only durable trace. A killed lane and a lane that
                    never fired leave the same evidence — nothing — so the
                    receipt is the instrument that tells them apart.
  DISCARD           the ``--heal`` prefetch dirties data/; the nightly is the
                    sole writer of record (G0.2, DNR:KILL-INTRADAY-CHRONICLE).
  BUDGET            a wedged pass is killed and REPORTED, never left holding the
                    lock into the nightly.

CLOCK. Every wall-clock decision is driven through an injected ``now_fn`` and an
injected ``sleep_fn``, so nothing here becomes a scheduled red at 16:05 ET.

NOTE ON THE OTHER SUITE. ``tests/test_close_pass_lane.py`` bans ``subprocess``
and ``git `` inside the four publish-path modules it reads. This runner is not
one of them and must not be added: running git IS its job — it is the half that
prepares a fresh checkout so the publish-path modules never have to.
