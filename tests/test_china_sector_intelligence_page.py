"""China Sector Intelligence consolidation invariants (2026-08 merge of
baskets_china + subsector_rotation_china into sector_central_china.html).

Sibling of tests/test_sector_intelligence_page.py, which pins the US merge; this
file pins the China one so a later template edit cannot silently undo it: the two
redirect stubs and their HASH FORWARDING, the merged page's section skeleton, the
payload externalization (no inline BASKETS/CHART embed), the inbound-hash contract,
the THS-survival fork, the collapsed nav, the ZH vocabulary ruling, and the
inverse guard that the US siblings were left alone.
