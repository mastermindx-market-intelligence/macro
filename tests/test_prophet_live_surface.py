"""tests/test_prophet_live_surface.py — Prophet Live P1 user-facing surfaces.

Covers the two surfaces the P1 design spec (``research/PROPHET_LIVE_P1_DESIGN_SPEC.md``)
adds to the us_stocks board:

  1. the "Forming today" strip in ``templates/dashboard.html.j2`` (SSR shell + page-inline
     CSS + the client render contract), and
  2. the reserved ◐ live chip in ``templates/_prophet_card.html.j2``.

WHY THIS SUITE IS BROWSER-FREE. The CI packs install a minimal dependency set, not
``requirements.txt`` — a ``pytest.importorskip("playwright")`` here would SKIP in CI and
report green while proving nothing (house trap: ci-packs-install-minimal-deps-not-requirements).
So everything mechanically checkable is asserted against the rendered template and the
shipped CSS/JS source text. The measurements that genuinely need a browser — height
invariance, computed hues, the DOM fence, row-cell geometry at every breakpoint — live in
``mockups/refs/prophet_live/verify_p1.py``, which is run by hand and whose output is pasted
into the PR body. Do NOT "upgrade" these to browser tests; they would stop running.

The assertions are deliberately about the LAWS, not the wording: presentation-tier fencing,
the banned vocabulary, the freshness disclosure, honest degradation, the derived height
contract, and the two payload fields that must degrade to an em-dash rather than be derived.
