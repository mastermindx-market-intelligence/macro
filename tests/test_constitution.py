"""Neural Web W7a — constitution core regression tests.

Tests:
1. Null-simulation REGRESSION — binomial null (base=0.30, n_alerts=8, 10k draws):
   - Wilson gate false-grant rate < 10%  (scout computed 5.8%)
   - Old point-estimate gate (>= 1.25) would have been > 35%
   The motivating math is embedded as assertions, not just comments.
1b. SAFETY PROPERTY SWEEP — full (k, n, base) sweep over base>=0.45 (the grant-more
    region identified by the reviewer) asserts ZERO grant-more cases: new Wilson gate
    with threshold > 1.25 never grants where the old point-estimate gate >= 1.25 denied.
    This test would go red immediately if the threshold regressed back to 1.0.
2. grant_authority paths: granted, refused (n), refused (events), refused (lift), lapsed.
2b. BOUNDARY DISCRIMINATION — production grant_authority() at reviewer's discriminating
    input (hits=8, n=30, base=0.14, lift_lb≈1.1237): refused at 1.25, granted at just-
    above (hits=9): brackets the boundary from both sides. Includes discrimination check
    confirming the test has power (would go RED at threshold 1.0).
3. A7 ORIGINATE refusal — target_level=A7_ORIGINATE refused unconditionally (Article 1),
   even with overwhelming evidence. Hard-coded before any evidence evaluation.
4. wilson_lower basic correctness + edge cases (k=0, k=n, n=0).
5. governance append/load round-trip — event_id determinism.
6. can_force scorecard: additive-fields compatibility (consumer reading only the bool).
7. Tune-loop governance event emission (mocked writes).
8. ARTICLES dict has entries 1, 2, 3.
9. article2_surfaces reads from synapse.yml (integration — skips if file absent).
