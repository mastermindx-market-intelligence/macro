    DOWNSTREAM of the CA shadow call site, using the REAL production wiring
    function (scripts.build_canada._canada_board_ledger — the exact code path
    the contract wires the shadow call into), across four variants: shadow
    module absent / present-empty / present-with-adversarial-challenger
    (non-vacuous order) / present-with-a-mutating-writer.

    CORRECTED DOCSTRING (M5, review round 2): this test does NOT detect a
    removal of write_shadow's deep-copy, and was WRONGLY described as doing
    so in the original draft. Structural reason: `_canada_board_ledger`
    builds `calls` as brand-new dicts via `calls.append({"ticker": r.get(...),
    ...})` from `setups["buy"]` rows — `calls` and `setups["buy"]` never share
    row-dict identity in the first place, so a hostile challenger mutating
    `calls[0]` was never going to reach `setups["buy"][0]` regardless of
    board_shadow's own protections. What this test DOES genuinely verify is
    the byte-identity regression on setups["buy"]/["board_track"] (the JSON
    body that becomes canada_standouts.json) and
    data/board_ledger/ca_board.parquet across all four variants — a real and
    useful guard, just not the F1 aliasing kill. F1's actual load-bearing
    kill for a genuine aliasing/write-surface channel is the write-surface
    fence test below (m2, review round 2), which snapshots the filesystem
    itself rather than relying on an object graph that happens not to alias
    here. The template-rendered HTML pages named in the contract's identity
    set are NOT exercised here (see DEVIATIONS in the build packet) — a full
    render needs the live site template + data tree this sparse suite does
    not check out.

# (merged fc5282f438fb, PR #6178) found CHALLENGER_REGISTRY keyed by
# challenger_definition only and write_shadow(market) iterating EVERY
# registration regardless of market — the first real registrant would have

# at merge, so no backward compatibility with the unscoped API was owed; the
# repair keys the registry (market, challenger_definition) and adds the
# market-selection seam _registrations_for(market). K15-K18 are the
# isolation kills proper (each with a POSITIVE CONTROL per the standing
# clause above); K19 is the executed mutation kill proving K15-K18 are
