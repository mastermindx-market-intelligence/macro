"""W-F — the flip-isolation construction behind the US reclaim-veto decision packet.

WHAT THIS PINS.  `research/prophet_us_audit/reclaim_veto_packet.py` claims that every row
it reports was refused SOLELY by the 200-day reclaim leg.  That claim rests on a two-part
predicate — the veto-ON stream BLOCKED the bar with the counter-trend reclaim reason AND
the veto-OFF stream TOOK the same bar — and the whole packet is worthless if either half
is wrong or redundant.  These tests exercise the REAL `engine.signal_quality._buy_filter`
for each physical case, so the predicate can never drift into a paraphrase of the engine
that agrees with itself.

THE TRAP THIS SUITE EXISTS FOR.  A name that fails the next-bar HOLD returns the SAME
string as one that fails the reclaim — both read "counter-trend, no 200-reclaim/hold" under
the default policy (see the `ok = held and reclaim` branch).  So filtering on the block
reason ALONE would silently sweep failed-hold bars into a packet that claims they were
refused by the reclaim leg.  The veto-OFF `take` half is what excludes them, and
`test_a_failed_hold_shares_the_block_reason...` below is the test that makes that half
load-bearing rather than decorative.

Sibling: tests/test_hk_reclaim_veto_policy.py pins the FLAG (defaults, blast radius, the
HK opt-out).  This file pins the MEASUREMENT built on top of it.  Synthetic series only —
no repo data, no network: a pin that drifts with the nightly panel cannot fail for the
right reason.
