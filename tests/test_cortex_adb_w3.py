"""ADB-W3 tests for engine.neuralweb.cortex two-way read tools.

Three suites:
  A. Full 3-way whitelist-parity test — every _READ_TOOLS name has exactly one
     schema in _tool_schemas() AND dispatches without 'unknown tool' error; every
     schema name is in the whitelist.  Enumerates dynamically so future drift fails.
  B. Happy-path and absent-path fixtures for read_master_brain_theses and
     read_master_brain_brief — caps, is_context_only, recency ordering, {absent:true}.
  C. Loop-benignity (ADB-R6) — both new tools are in _READ_TOOLS and NOT in the
     write-tool set; write-tool set is exactly its current 3 members.

ALL TESTS ARE OFFLINE — no API calls, no paid spend.
