"""The trigger-closure guard: a suite's path filter must reach what the suite reads.

WHAT THIS PINS.  `scripts/check_ci_trigger_closure.py` fails a PR when a module in a
guarded suite's read-closure is matched by no `on.pull_request.paths` entry of any
workflow that runs it.  That is the #3488 lesson ("a guard whose own edit cannot
start the workflow is only half wired") turned from a comment into a check.

WHY THE TESTS BELOW LOOK LIKE THEY DO.  Three of them exist because writing this
guard produced three near-misses that a green suite would not have caught:

  * `fnmatch` is NOT GitHub's glob.  A single `*` crosses `/` in fnmatch and does
    not on GitHub, so a filter of `scripts/*.py` reads as covering
    `scripts/ci/deep.py`.  A guard built on fnmatch silently blesses exactly the
    nested modules most likely to be missing an entry.  `scripts/audit_unrun_tests.py`
    still uses fnmatch — it is a reporting tool and over-reporting coverage there is
    survivable; here it would be a hole in a merge gate.
  * PROSE IS NOT A READ.  A path named in a docstring, a comment, or inside an
    assertion sentence is a claim about a subject, not a read of one.  The census
    already learned this once from the other side (OIP E8: a suite named in a YAML
    comment counted as "run by CI").
  * A JOIN'S BASE DECIDES WHAT IT NAMES.  `tmp_path / "config" / "brain.yml"` has the
    same segments as `ROOT / "config" / "brain.yml"` and is a file the suite WRITES.

A fourth joined in #4733's wake: A PATH LITERAL IS NOT ALWAYS A READ.  A suite whose
SUBJECT MATTER is path filtering carries file NAMES as fixture data, and the heuristic
cannot tell those from inputs.  `# ci-trigger-closure: data` is the author's explicit
"this is a name" — section 5 below pins it in both directions, because an exemption
that only ever suppresses is indistinguishable from a detector that stopped working.
