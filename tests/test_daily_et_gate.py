"""ET regime gate for daily.yml's DST cron pair (Nov-2026 FINRA race fix).

The nightly anchors at 18:30 America/New_York year-round, ~30 min after the
~6pm-ET FINRA CNMSshvol post. GitHub cron has no timezone, so daily.yml ships a
DST PAIR ("30 22 * * *" for EDT, "30 23 * * *" for EST) and the root ``et_gate``
job keeps exactly one of them: it derives the New York UTC offset from stdlib
``zoneinfo`` and compares the fired ``github.event.schedule`` against the cron
the current regime intends. Without the gate, the November flip turns 22:30Z
into 17:30 EST, which RACES the FINRA file — collectors/finra_short_volume.py
404-skips and self-heals the next night, so the site would run one day stale all
winter with nothing red.

Two halves:

1. BEHAVIOR — these tests EXTRACT the inline gate script out of daily.yml and
   EXECUTE it against fixed instants either side of both DST flips. A mirrored
   copy of the logic would be vacuous: it would pass while the shipped workflow
   drifted. Instants are timezone-AWARE, so the result does not depend on the
   machine's local TZ.

2. WIRING — the anti-drift pins: the yaml cron pair and the script's cron
   constants may only move in lockstep; EVERY job (present and future) must
   REACH the gate, either directly (``et_gate`` in ``needs`` + the guard in its
   ``if``) or transitively down a needs-chain, with the transitive set held as
   an explicit allowlist; ``et_gate`` stays ubuntu-hosted and checkout-free (a
   self-hosted job with a cap would owe the W2 timings wiring in
   tests/test_nightly_timings.py, and a checkout of the multi-GB tree would blow
   the ~15-second budget for the no-op firing); and the jobs that carry
   ``always()`` keep it — that is what makes the gate FAIL-OPEN.
