"""Guard the FRED-frontend fail-fast circuit breaker on the macro collectors.

A FRED-frontend outage once turned the intl_macro plane into a ~56-minute no-op
(34 series x 3 retries x 30s, every one timing out and producing nothing). These
collectors now abort a source after a short run of CONSECUTIVE connection failures,
while still trying every series when the failures are merely dead series ids.

    """Pin these breaker tests to their STUBS, never to the runner's uplink.

    2026-08-04: ``test_intl_aborts_fast_when_host_unreachable`` was RED on a
    pristine main on any NETWORKED machine, and clobbered a tracked file on
    every run.  The tests stub only ``a._fetch_fred``, but
    ``IntlMacroAdapter.fetch()`` grew a SECOND live leg in #4109 — the
    ``official_series`` loop (``_fetch_official`` -> ``http_get`` -> live
    ECB/Eurostat, 2 series in config.yml).  With connectivity those officials
    RESOLVED, so ``frames`` was non-empty, the expected RuntimeError never
    raised, and ``fetch()`` ran on into ``_write_provenance()`` against the REAL
    ``data/intl_macro/provenance.json`` — rewriting 358 lines of committed
    provenance down to the ~28 lines of whichever 2 series happened to resolve.
    Offline, the identical test passed.  A verdict that depends on the runner's
    network is not a test.

    Two belts, because the per-test ``_fetch_official`` stubs below only close
    the leg we know about today:
      * socket-level block — any FUTURE unstubbed live leg fails LOUDLY right
        here instead of silently inheriting the machine's connectivity;
      * ``config.data_dir`` -> tmp_path — the conftest MM_DATA_GUARD idiom, so a
        provenance write that ever does get reached physically lands outside the
        repo.  Both collectors.intl_macro and collectors.base call
        ``config.data_dir()`` through the module reference, so patching the
        module attribute covers them at call time.
