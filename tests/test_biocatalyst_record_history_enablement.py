"""The ClinicalTrials.gov Record History bounded activation, and its fences.

The repository operator cleared the rights gate on 2026-08-07
(``research/BIOCATALYST_OPERATOR_RULING_2026-08-07.md``, Ruling 1). The
2026-08-11 forward-clock wave separately arms the runtime and exact four-NCT
universe. Every assertion here fences that bounded activation:

* the **runtime** gate is on only for this reviewed canary path;
* the **universe** is exactly the four B1 NCTs, never discovery or expansion;
* the **source-shape canary** is still mandatory, because the transport is an
  undocumented UI-backing route that can change without notice;
* public projection is source facts with attribution only; and
* all seven distribution obligations that bind every surface displaying this
  data are intact.

It also pins that the frozen policy file is not rewritten to impersonate live
state. Exactly three clocks open through the activation receipt, never through
a config boolean, and they accrue from the receipt instant with no backfill.
