"""Pins the nightly-liveness dead-man switch against the 2026-08-11/12 outage.

Every fixture below is a shape this repository actually produced during the two
sessions the US nightly went dark. The point of the suite is that each check fails
for its OWN reason: if you delete check A, `test_strand_is_invisible_to_data_checks`
is the one that reds, and it reds specifically because the data budgets are still
satisfied at that moment. That is the defect the guard exists for.

Fixture dates are CONSTANTS with no relation to the wall clock. A guard whose
fixtures age is a scheduled red.
