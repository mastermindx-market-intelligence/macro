"""China delayed-board disclosure — the engine verdict and the string the sentinel reads.

china.html used to render no board-lag disclosure at all, so
scripts/freshness_sentinel.py ran that surface bake-only: a China board could freeze for a
week while the page re-baked nightly and nothing would say so. This suite pins the whole
chain end to end:

    build_china_library.compute_board_staleness  →  board_staleness.delayed
        →  templates/china.html.j2 renders "prices as of YYYY-MM-DD"
            →  freshness_sentinel.board_delay_stamp parses it
                →  evaluate() breaches past the china delay budget

The contract test at the bottom is the load-bearing one: the template's English wording and
the sentinel's regex are two halves of one interface held together by nothing but this
assertion. Reword the banner without it and the sentinel silently reads a healthy page
forever — the exact failure this disclosure was built to end.
