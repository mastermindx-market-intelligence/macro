"""Rendered-HTML contract for the US board priority display layer (us_prophet_v1).

Program: research/PROPHET_BOARD_PRIORITY_ENGINE_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md
Gates covered here: G0.1 (priority order + stage buckets), G0.2 (featured glow),
G0.4 (ran lane), G0.5 (theme chips), G0.6 (stage filter
chips + NEW badge), G0.7 (honest score framing on the surface).

TWO SHAPES, ONE TEMPLATE.  The committed `site/factordata/us_standouts.json` does
NOT carry stage / prophet / featured / new / theme yet — the first nightly after the
engine lane merges fills them.  So every assertion below comes in a pair: the new
schema must produce the priority surface, and the OLD schema must still produce the
legacy lane-partition board with none of it.  A regression that quietly drops the
fail-soft branch would ship a blank board on merge night.

ASSERTION STYLE (harness law): every presence/absence assertion targets a full
markup string (`'<div class="nb-stage-hd sg-live"'`), never a bare class token.
The CSS rules for all of this ship on every render, so `'nb-stage-hd' in html`
is true even when nothing renders — an absence test written that way is vacuous.

`priority_overlay()` is also the fixture the preview/screenshot pass uses against
the LIVE artifact (see the module docstring on how to run it) — keeping it here,
deterministic and site/-free, means the picture and the test see the same shapes.

P-MP1-SHELL RETIREMENT NOTE (2026-08-20): the candidate-card rendering this file
exercises (stage/lane headings, the pbf-bar filter, the featured glow chip, the
marks row, the ⚡/NEW/absence marks — all sourced from `us_standouts.buy`) was
RETIRED from the Setups grid by MP-1-prophet-board.md §6 row 4 / §12 item 4: the
grid re-sources from the plan book (site/prophet/index.json.plans) instead. 22
of this file's tests are marked `@pytest.mark.skip` with that citation rather
than deleted or rewritten to assert vacuously — this is disclosed test debt
(worker report, P-MP1-SHELL commission), not a silent coverage loss. The
retirement itself is proven positively in
tests/test_dashboard_template_render.py::
test_candidate_stage_rail_absent_from_setups_grid. The 36 tests left unskipped
in this file exercise `priority_overlay()`/`_stage_of()` as pure helpers or
assert on us_standouts-driven surfaces this packet does not touch (the
Recently-fired `pbr` lane, the theme tape) and remain valid.
