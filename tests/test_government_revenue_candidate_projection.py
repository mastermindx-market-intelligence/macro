    The incident is a closed historical fact with fixed bytes -- first issuance,
    run 31354784751, commit ``5fc18d5aac8``, 2026-08-10T04:15Z -- so its ledger
    is the frozen 8-row / 50,790-byte vintage
    ``920d840a328b6be88600230f93c8353af30520172c682b25b7302fd4124f7820`` carried
    beside the queue/state blobs under :data:`_INCIDENT_FIXTURE_DIRECTORY`.

    **An incident test may never read the live ``candidate_ledger.jsonl``.**
    That store is append-only and grows: the next real candidate issuance adds a
    row, and the frozen predecessor state fixture below binds the ledger by
    ``byte_count``/``sha256``, so a live read makes
    ``_validate_ledger_state_binding`` -- and every incident assertion behind it
    -- fail on a night no code changed.  This is the same class of scheduled
    failure ``tests/government_revenue_candidate_fixture`` was written to end,
    one store over.  The live artifact keeps its own append-safe probe (a
    ``>=``-length, 50,790-byte *prefix* digest) in the grader suite, which is
    where a human is meant to re-read it.

    **The canonical inputs are frozen to the incident vintage too**, which
    reverses this docstring's original claim that freezing them "is what would
    break".  That claim was right about the *clock* and wrong about the *source*.
    A first activation is only legal on a run that observes the incident ledger
    unchanged: ``candidates.py`` refuses when ``generated_at == activated_at`` and
    ``append_count != 0`` ("candidate correction activation changed the incident
    ledger").  Pairing the frozen 8-row predecessor with a live source therefore
    held only while the live source still yielded exactly those eight rows, and it
    stopped holding on 2026-08-12T23:50:04Z when the award-action rail resolved
    and the projection issued fifteen forward candidates.  The engine is right and
    the replay's premise was what went stale -- production activated once, in
    2026-08-10T04:30Z, and activation is durable, so no run can ever legitimately
    first-activate against today's source again.

    This is handoff §2.5's standing rule ("a frozen incident vintage freezes its
    GRAPH too"; "every new frozen fixture must include its graph bytes") applied
    to the whole input boundary: :data:`_INCIDENT_CANONICAL_SOURCE` carries the
    ``latest``/``workspace``/``recipient_entity_graph`` bytes exactly as commit
    ``5fc18d5aac8`` published them, with per-file digests in
    ``canonical_source.receipt.json``.  Because the graph travels with them, the
    replay is already correct for the defense20 republish, which re-times
    ``observation_id`` through the graph digest it embeds.

    The run clock stays live-derived on purpose.  It only has to sit *forward* of
    every source instant, and a live clock over a frozen-older source satisfies
    that by construction -- so the incident replay inherits no scheduled failure
    from either direction.
