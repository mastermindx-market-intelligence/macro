"""china_standouts.json serialization contract — tuple-key regression guard.

2026-07-13→07-16 outage: SA-W2 F7 (#2419) made china_standout_track.grade() return
``fwd_excess_map_21d`` keyed by (ticker, date) TUPLES; build_china_library.main()
attached grade()'s output wholesale to wide["board_track"], and the final
``json.dumps(wide, ..., default=str)`` crashed every asia run — ``default=`` only
covers VALUES, tuple KEYS are a hard TypeError. build_china.py swallowed the
exception in one line and served the persisted 07-10 artifact, so runs stayed
green while the board sat 5× past its 30h SLA.

Guards:
  • _detach_board_track_plumbing strips the map (tuple keys intact for
    run_attribution) so the artifact-bound dict serializes.
  • _find_bad_json_keys names the offending key path when the final dumps fails,
    so any FUTURE tuple-key regression is locatable from CI logs.

# direction: there the artifact was genuinely unbuildable, here it was perfect.
#
# 2026-08-05→08-06: #4509 moved the board to ``cn_prophet_v3``.  build_china.py
# kept a hand-copied ``_CN_PROPHET_DEFINITION = "cn_prophet_v2"`` from #4029, so
# _is_current_prophet_artifact rejected the LIVE board and the persisted fallback
# alike and china_stocks.html rendered "data coverage degraded — board incomplete
# today" over a complete same-day board (24 featured / 204 eligible).  Nothing tied
# the renderer's pin to the engine's, so the drift was invisible to CI and surfaced
# only when the operator read the banner.
