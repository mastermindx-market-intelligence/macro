"""CN COLLECTION-LANE GATE — the board/ripening/audit/event-latch half of the CN_LANE fix.

WHAT SHIPPED DEAD
-----------------
Three CN sinks refused a write only when a lane was passed AND was not asia::

    if lane is not None and lane != "asia":      # china_standout_track.append_board
    if lane is not None and lane != "asia":      # china_standout_track.append_ripening
    if lane is not None and lane != "asia":      # cn_prophet_audit.run

and the one production caller resolved its lane with a PERMISSIVE default::

    _lane = os.environ.get("CN_LANE", "asia")    # scripts/build_china_library

Only .github/workflows/asia-close.yml sets ``CN_LANE`` ("the ONLY lane that may persist the
board ledger" — its own comment, line 276; line 278 says render lanes "leave CN_LANE
unset/non-asia so china_standout_track.append_board refuses"). So every other lane resolved
to the string "asia" and the refusal could not fire on any run — doubly dead, once at the
resolver and once at each sink. daily.yml (`git add data/`) and weekly.yml (`git add data/
reports/ site/`) both run scripts.build_china_library and both COMMIT ``data/``.

WHY IT MATTERS. The board store is keep-FIRST per (date, ticker, board_definition): the
first lane to write a date OWNS it — its ranks and its ``own_market_regime``, which stays
null forever when the regime row was not written in that lane, because no later nightly may
correct a kept row. The T2 event latch is worse: a fired conjunction may never be un-fired,
so a render lane running mid-CN-session could latch a conjunction computed on a partial bar.

WHAT THIS FILE PINS
-------------------
§1 RESOLVER CENSUS   — AST: exactly ONE CN_LANE environment read exists in
                       scripts/build_china_library.py, it lives in ``_collection_lane``, and
                       it carries no default. This reds on a permissive re-introduction
                       ANYWHERE in the file, which is the strongest pin here.
§2 FAIL-CLOSED SINKS — unit pins on a writable fixture: asia writes (the witness), an
                       unnamed lane and a named non-asia lane refuse.
§3 PRODUCTION PATH   — the env-driven shape ``main()`` actually uses, over unset / "" /
                       daily / weekly / asia. This is the path the old tests never took:
                       they hand-fed ``lane=`` and stayed green while the gate did nothing.
§4 CALL-SHAPE SCAN   — every CN-sink call in engine/ + scripts/ names its lane. The gate is
                       fail-closed now, so a FORGOTTEN ``lane=`` silently stops persisting
                       instead — equally wrong and invisible without this scan.
§5 EVENT-LATCH SITE  — the third gate, pinned by content (executing main() is not an option).

HERMETIC IN DATA AND IN TIME. Every store is redirected under ``tmp_path`` and
``lib.store.read_status`` is stubbed empty, so ``session_status`` takes its documented
"no run_status — assumed settled" branch instead of reading the repo's panel stamp. Nothing
on these write paths consults the wall clock, so ``BOARD_DATE`` below is a fixture key, not
a date that can rot: it is only ever compared to itself as a keep-first store key.
