"""Mutation / anti-vacuity suite for the Reference Integrity Gate checker.

Law: ``research/REFERENCE_INTEGRITY_GATE_V1.md``.  Guard:
``scripts/check_reference_integrity.py``.

Three suites:

A. **Mutation / anti-vacuity.**  A gate that cannot fail is not a gate.  Every test starts
   from a fully-VALID approved synthetic artifact set (which must pass), corrupts exactly
   one thing, and asserts the matching STABLE finding code fires.  The valid-set builder
   here is deliberately INDEPENDENT of the checker's own ``--selftest`` fixtures: a shared
   builder would let one wrong assumption make both agree, which is the vacuity this suite
   exists to prevent.

B. **Founding case.**  The real committed fixture
   ``research/reference_integrity/prophet-board-5514-original/`` — the original Prophet
   Board mockup frozen at ``668e5954`` (RIG §10).  The checker must independently derive
   the mechanically-derivable defects from the fixture's honest ledgers, and a
   ``TEN_REGRESSIONS`` map pins which code catches which of the ten recorded regressions.

   ``TestFoundingReceipts`` asserts the receipt/verdict invariants — the files produced by
   the two independent critics and the design authority.  Those assertions are written to
   the LAW, not to whatever the receipts happen to say: if a receipt lands that does not
   satisfy them, the receipt is wrong.  Never satisfy this class by writing or editing the
   receipts from the guard's own session — a receipt written by the party being reviewed is
   the exact laundering RIG §6 exists to stop.

C. **Output shape.**  Every annotation must START its line, or GitHub silently drops it
   (house annotation law).  Pins the defect class, not the wording.

D. **Revision continuity (RIG §13 / L10, V1.1).**  The seam BETWEEN cycles.  Its anchor case
   is the real r2→r3 failure: a successor that fixed everything its own rationale discussed
   and silently dropped four items the predecessor had already upheld.  The suite's spine is
   that the omission must be caught at status ``in_review`` with **no critic receipts in
   existence** — continuity is an admission gate, not a judgment gate, so it fires before the
   fleet spends two independent Opus critics re-deriving the gap.  Fixture builders here are
   again independent of the checker's own ``--selftest`` fixtures.
