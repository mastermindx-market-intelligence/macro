# OIP W1 nav regroup (research/options_estate/W1_DESIGN_SPEC.md §1.2): Options &
# Flow's flyout shrinks from 9 rows (trigger + gex + options_screener + movers +
# flow_desk + intraday_flow + flow_leaders + darkpool + market_structure) to 6
# (trigger + options.html + gex.html [now carrying the freed submenu-icon-dashboard]
# + intraday_flow + darkpool + market_structure) — options_screener/flow_desk/
# flow_leaders leave the flyout (URLs stay live forever with their own banner) and
# Daily Movers relocated into the United States group (same submenu-icon-stocks,
# net zero on that family at the time). submenu-icon-leader was flow_leaders' ONLY user
# anywhere in this menu, so it drops out of EXPECTED_ICON_FAMILIES entirely rather
# than staying in the emitted-minus set below (unlike allocation/bitcoin, which
# are used elsewhere, just not in THIS rendered menu). Net count verified against
# the real re-rendered template, not hand-counted: 61 -> 59.
#
# Sector Intelligence consolidation (2026-08, nav 4 -> 2): the Thematic Baskets,
# Subsector Rotation and Confluence entries fold into the merged Sector
# Intelligence page, and two merged entries replace them — 5 submenu-icon spans
# removed, 2 added, net -3, so 59 -> 56. Counted off the diff of the real
# _navlinks.html.j2, not by hand. EXPECTED_EMITTED_ICON_FAMILIES is unchanged on
# purpose: submenu-icon-baskets / -rotation / -confluence each still have at
# least one other user in this menu, so no FAMILY leaves the set — only the
# per-span count moves. If a family ever does drop out, the families assertion
# above fails first and this comment is the place to say why.
#
# China Sector Intelligence consolidation (2026-08, nav 5 -> 3): a family DID drop
# out, so per the note above, here is why. The China group's nested "Sector Central"
# submenu (trigger + 5 rows = 6 spans) flattens to 3 rows, net -3, so 56 -> 53 —
# counted off the re-rendered _navlinks.html.j2, not by hand. submenu-icon-rotation
# leaves the EMITTED set: the China Subsector Rotation row was its last user in this
# menu once the US row folded into the merged US page one program earlier. It stays
# in EXPECTED_ICON_FAMILIES rather than leaving entirely (the submenu-icon-leader
# precedent) because product-nav-icons.css still draws it and dashboard-icons.js
# still uses it — it is used elsewhere, just not in THIS rendered menu, which is
# exactly the allocation/bitcoin case. submenu-icon-baskets (5 -> 4) and
# submenu-icon-intelligence (4 -> 3) lose spans but keep other users, so they stay.
#
# OIP W1.6-B "One Door" (nav 53 -> 52): the options flyout's gex.html "Options
# Desk" row is deleted — the workspace absorbed that page, which is a redirect
# stub now — removing exactly one submenu-icon span. The Intraday Flow Tracker
# row MOVED (flyout -> United States group) and kept its icon, so it is net
# zero. The deleted row used submenu-icon-dashboard, which the Macro Dashboard
# and the relocated Intraday Flow rows both still use, so this program removes
# no FAMILY of its own — the emitted-minus set below is the China program's.
#
# This branch and the China consolidation landed against the same 56 and were
# merged here, so the two deltas COMPOSE (-3 then -1) rather than either count
# standing alone. Daily Movers was later consolidated into the stocks hub and
# removed from navigation, so its one submenu-icon-stocks span takes 52 -> 51;
# the family remains emitted by every regional Stock Dashboard row.
# TOP ANATOMY W1 "Winner Health" (nav 52 -> 52 spans + 1, i.e. 51 -> 52): a family
# RE-ENTERS. submenu-icon-leader left EXPECTED_ICON_FAMILIES entirely at the OIP W1
# regroup above, when flow_leaders — its only user anywhere in this menu — left the
# Options flyout. The new Winner Health row (United States group, beside Stage
# Analysis) is its next user, so it comes back to the set rather than being added as
# a new family: product-nav-icons.css has drawn `.submenu-icon-leader` continuously
# through both events (it never left the stylesheet, and dashboard-icons.js kept
# using it), so nothing is registered here that was not already drawn. The glyph —
# ascending bars under a rising arrow — is the board's own population: names that
# have already run a long way up. Exactly one span is added, counted off the
# re-rendered _navlinks.html.j2 rather than by hand.
