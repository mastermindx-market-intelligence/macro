"""The etfs.html tier gate — the split IS the boundary.

etfs.html is a 13F fund-conviction desk: which stocks tracked managers are
accumulating, ranked by cross-fund agreement, with an explicit "what to do"
stance column. Roughly 55% of its bytes are graded output, so unlike the two
Special Situations shells (which W1a merely re-classified) this page had to be
SPLIT before it could go anonymous-public. What ships free is context and honest
totals — the rotation backdrop, the whole fund coverage directory, the counts —
and ZERO stock rows: both boards are best-first, and previewing a best-first
board hands over its head, which is the part people pay for.

Two layers, deliberately:

* the SPLIT is proven hermetically (fake rows, real templates), so the contract
  holds even before a render lane has rebaked the desk;
* the SHIPPED BYTES are then checked against the same invariant — no row the
  paid payload carries may also sit in the free shell.

The second layer skips (loudly) until the desk has been rebaked in the gated
shape, because the baked page on main lags a template change by one render.

Kept import-light on purpose: this runs in ci.yml's `tier-gate` job, whose venv
is `pytest pyyaml jinja2 fastapi httpx`. Never import scripts.build_site here —
it pulls numpy/pandas/plotly and would turn the whole job into an error.

See docs/TIER_PREVIEW_PATTERN.md and
research/seo_supercharge/W2_HEATMAP_ETFS_PREVIEW_SPEC.md (Part B).
