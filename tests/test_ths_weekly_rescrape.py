"""The weekly 同花顺 re-scrape: receipts, complete-or-fail promotion, PIT ingest.

WHAT WAS BROKEN (and what these pins protect)
---------------------------------------------
``collectors/china_ths_concepts.py`` and ``scripts/seed_china_ths_baskets.py``
appeared in ZERO workflows, so ``data/baskets_china_ths/membership.json`` froze
on 2026-06-30 and the PIT store held two snapshots eight days apart — while
``build_baskets_china_ths --snapshot`` ran green ~35 nights in a row, dedup-
skipping every one because its input never moved.  ``scripts/scrape_ths_weekly.py``
is the missing producer.

The load-bearing rule it adds is COMPLETE-OR-FAIL at the RUN level.  The
collector already refuses to record a PARTIAL member list for one board; the
identical hazard one level up had nothing enforcing it, and it is worse, because
``seed_china_ths_baskets`` enumerates its auto-imported taxonomy from the NEWEST
side-car's keys alone (line 373) — so a side-car missing 173 of 373 boards does
not merely under-report those boards, it deletes their baskets.  Hence: scrape
into staging, promote only when every board resolved.

The last class here covers the mixed-shape snapshot directory: two producers write
two different document shapes into one directory, and under W1a which of them wrote
last silently decided whether a re-seed preserved the taxonomy or emptied it.  W1b
fixes that in two independent layers — content-based shape discrimination and a
write-level mass-deletion interlock — and ``TestSeederShapeCollision`` now pins the
FIXED behaviour, including the hostile case where the classification is deliberately
broken and the interlock alone has to save the taxonomy.

Fixture-only: nothing here reads live ``data/`` and nothing pins a live count.

      1. **Shape discrimination.** ``classify_snapshot_shape`` decides by parsed
         CONTENT with a positive signature for each shape; a document matching
         neither or both is refused loudly, never guessed at.  ``_all_snapshots``
         and ``_latest_snapshot`` keep raw dumps only.
      2. **A write-level mass-deletion interlock**, independent of every shape
         decision: a reseed that would drop >50% of the existing auto ``thsc*``
         baskets refuses to publish.  The directive's hostile guarantee — "a mixed
