"""close_pass_slo_report — the evening board's acceptance record (W-L1, PR-C).

WHAT THESE PIN
--------------
The report is the instrument the three-consecutive-session live acceptance will
be graded with, so its failure modes are grading failures, not display bugs:

  * a session with NO stamp must be a ROW, not a gap. Iterating the record's own
    keys steps straight over the evening the board never published and reports a
    streak that never happened — the gate passing on its own missing data.
  * an unmeasured field must print ``—``. A 0 in ``close→cand`` claims the board
    was built the instant the close landed, which is a statement about the
    pipeline that nothing measured.
  * ``sla_met`` is READ from the append-only record and ``product_slo_met`` is
    COMPUTED from the recorded instant. The report is not the authority on the
    gate it reports.
  * a record written before the decomposition existed must still grade. The file
    lives on the VPS across deploys, so the first post-upgrade pass opens a file
    the previous version wrote.

Fixture numbers are the real Fri 2026-08-14 board (published 23:19:14.286019Z =
19:19 ET, 22 admitted of 253 evaluated from a 1,763 universe) plus two synthetic
neighbours that exercise the legacy and never-published shapes.
