"""Staging-glob invariant for collect-lane commit steps (neural-web D7).

The qledger grader runs inside every ``scripts.collect`` invocation
(scripts/collect.py -> grade_qledger.run_as_collect_step) and rewrites the
TRACKED ``site/qledger/track_record.json`` (un-ignored by #1139).  Left
unstaged, that tracked modification makes ``git pull --rebase`` refuse with
"unstaged changes", the push loop dies after 5 attempts with only a swallowed
warning, and the night's collection is silently lost — the 2026-07-03 and
2026-07-04 daily collections went exactly this way.

The invariant is therefore about the FIRST checkpoint of a collect job, not
about every commit step in it.  Since #4731 (2026-08-06) the daily collect job
checkpoints twice: a market checkpoint that stages ``data/ site/qledger/``, and
a deliberately narrow capital-structure checkpoint that stages only
``data/capital_structure site/capital-structure-data`` so a capital-structure
veto can no longer cost the night's market data.  A broad ``git add`` in that
second step would re-open the coupling the split removed, so demanding
``site/qledger/`` from it is wrong — by the time it runs the qledger is already
committed, and there is nothing left for a rebase to trip on.

#4746 (2026-08-07) then moved the whole capital-structure chain into its own
job, so no collect job carries that second checkpoint any more.  What daily.yml
does carry is a different shape: the chain-snapshot salvage step (#4705), gated
on ``collectors.outcome != 'success'`` — the exact NEGATION of the market
checkpoint's gate.  It is not a later checkpoint racing the first; it is the
other side of a fork, and it exists precisely because the market commit was
skipped.  Demanding the market checkpoint's gate from it would make it
unsatisfiable, and demanding ``site/qledger/`` from it would publish a
track_record.json graded on a collect run that FAILED.

What keeps all of this safe is ordering, and ordering is what these tests pin:
  * the first commit step in a collect job stages ``site/qledger/``, so the
    grader's tracked write is committed before any push step's rebase; and
  * every later commit step either is gated on at least the step outcomes the
    first one is gated on (SUBSET — it cannot run in a state where the first did
    not), or negates one of them (FORK — it cannot run in the same branch at all)
    while carrying ``--autostash`` on its own rebase, which is what actually
    stops the grader's unstaged write from refusing that rebase.
