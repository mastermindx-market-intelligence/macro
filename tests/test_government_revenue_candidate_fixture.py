"""Unit cover for the derived-clock helpers the candidate suites share.

These run in seconds and touch no fixture root, which is the whole point: the
offsets they exercise are derived from a live vintage, so a margin too thin to
absorb one should fail HERE, with the margin printed, rather than eight minutes
into the projection suite behind a builder guard whose message ("canonical
latest known_at is after the frozen generated_at clock") names the symptom and
hides the cause.
