"""The card must earn its pixels — restatement gates + 1080 square geometry.

Operator defect report 2026-08-02, from live posts on the flagship account. Three
of the four defects are pinned here (the fourth, source-account tagging, has its
own file); every fixture below is a REAL shipped post, not an invention.

  Defect 2 — card title == description. For an X-relay item the feed builds
    headline = snippet[:120] and body_snippet = the same snippet, so the card
    rendered one sentence at two sizes.
  Defect 3 — cards that add nothing. "On the tape: <headline> -- <credit>" beside
    a card whose only content was <headline>.
  Defect 4 — card geometry wrong for social. A 1000x560 landscape card is
    illegible in a phone feed; the canvas is now 1080x1080 (AD_MASTER_PAPER
    §4.1) with the mobile type floors of §0 AG-3.

SECOND OPERATOR DEFECT REPORT, 2026-08-05 — three more live RADAR posts
(@mastermindx001, Aug 4-5) shipped cards that restated the tweet, clipped
mid-clause on a static PNG, and printed the source's masthead. A 14-agent
adversarial audit confirmed 35 defects; the root causes are pinned below.

  Defect 5 — the gate could not say no. card_earns_attachment was
    APPROVAL-ONLY: its summary branch returned True and no branch returned
    False on the strength of the card BODY, so control fell through to a
    headline check and attached. Nothing ever asked whether the card's HERO
    restated the tweet, which is exactly what the India card did.
  Defect 6 — the card could not fit, and shipped clipped anyway. The summary
    wrap's `overflowed` flag was discarded at the call site, so a 320-char
    producer budget met a ~140-char box and lost the difference behind an
    ellipsis that no gate and no provenance record could see.
  Defect 7 — the chip branded the source. It printed "<Outlet> · WIRE SERVICE"
    by design; the only suppressor was a six-entry denylist of generic
    placeholders that cannot match a real masthead.

Every pin here was mutation-checked: the production change was reverted, the
test observed to FAIL, then restored.

    citation policy downgraded the item to `digest`, and the `pytest.skip`
    branch ran on every execution since the test was written. The second pass
    dropped to a UNIT call on hand-written strings at the exact moment the

    zero evidence that any real item can still ship one.

    real production emission: a company's transcript summary ("Revenue held
    above plan while management kept full-year guidance") says something the
    composed post does not, which is the whole test the gate applies. It runs
    through the SAME `card_earns_attachment` as press_lane (wired 2026-08-06),
    so a change that blanket-drops cards fails here.

    WHY NOT A PRESS TICK — and this is a product fact worth stating rather than
    routing around: on the DETERMINISTIC press path the post body and the card
    summary are the same string (both are summarize_item's output), and the X

    allows. So the card's body is a subset of the post by construction and the

# THE KILL PATHS — a withheld card must slim the post down, never delete it
#
# Round 1 gave the gate the power to refuse a card and stopped there. Both gates
# that read `media` downstream take an empty list as "this post has no
# evidence", which is the wrong inference when we deliberately withheld a
# picture that added nothing. Measured end to end on 2026-08-05, on the repo's
# own press fixture: no digit in the copy -> value_gate `proof:below_hard`,
# ABSTAINED, nothing emitted; digit present -> emitted with media=[] and then
# QUARANTINED by scripts/marketing_publisher._bare_cashtag_post. The operator's
# complaint was a doubled card and the delivered behaviour was no post at all.
#
# THE RULING THAT DECIDES HOW THIS IS FIXED (2026-08-06). The first repair
# taught value_gate to read a WITHHELD card as `hard` proof. That was circular:
# the only thing that sets the withheld flag is card_earns_attachment answering
# False, whose meaning is exactly "this picture contains nothing the post does
# not already say", and the claim was persisted into `source.value_gate`, the
# calibration record. A WIRE RELAY'S PROOF IS ITS SOURCE, not a picture of its
# own text — so the withheld proof rung is gone and the repaired citation rung
# (press_lane read provenance["url"], build_breaking_payload writes
# "source_url") carries these posts.
#
# MEASURED, WITH THE METHOD STATED (re-run 2026-08-06; the earlier figure of "6
# carried by that rung ALONE" carried no method and did not reproduce). Read
# data/marketing/outbox/items.jsonl, keep source.lane == "press" (75 rows), and
# for each row re-evaluate value_gate with has_media=False — the withheld-card
# world — twice: once with the row's own source.source_url as `citation`, once
# with citation="". Splitting the persisted `text` on outbox.compose_text's
# "\n\n" gives the headline/body pair the gate saw. RESULT: 75/75 (100%) carry an
# http(s) source_url; 15 reach `hard` ONLY with the citation, i.e. the repaired
# rung is what carries them; 0 are held for want of proof. A post with no figure,
# no link and no picture is held, and that is the gate working.
