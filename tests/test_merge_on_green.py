"""Contract + decision tests for the merge-on-green sweeper.

The sweeper is the account-side substitute for branch protection (operator ruling
2026-07-28): a session arms its pull request with the `merge-on-green` label and
stops instead of sitting 20-60 minutes as a CI hostage, and this lane performs the
merge once every check has CONCLUDED clean.

Two things are pinned here. The WORKFLOW contract, because the sweep is worthless
if it is scheduled wrong, queued behind the render lane, or handed a token that
cannot merge. And the DECISION, factored into a pure function over a check-run
list so the four outcomes are provable without a network.

# ci.yml stopped launching a fixed `ci-pack-0..11` on every head. `ci-plan` now
# computes the pack plan once and publishes a matrix; `ci-pack` carries
# `needs.ci-plan.outputs.has_work == 'true'` on top of its old `action != 'closed'`
# fence, so a PR may publish ANY SUBSET of the twelve pack names — including none at
# all — while main's `workflow_dispatch` baseline passes no `--changed-from` and so
# still publishes all twelve. `ci-gate` is the one name published on every non-closed
# event, and it is what makes the whole thing safe here.
#
# This shifted the ground under `decide_verdict` WITHOUT changing a line of it: the
# function has always been name-agnostic, so nothing in it enumerates pack names or
# counts them. That is precisely why these pins exist. The dangerous edit is not one
# that breaks a pack name; it is a future "the sweeper should require the full pack
# set" hardening, which would read as a tightening and would silently make every
# path-scoped PR permanently unmergeable. The six shapes below are the whole
# interface the sweeper now depends on, asserted against the pure function.

    `update_status` defaults to 422 — GitHub's "I cannot fast-forward this"
    answer — so a test that does not opt in keeps the old behaviour: a refused
    merge falls through to `merge-blocked`.

    `pull_payload` is what a re-read of the pull request itself returns. It
    defaults to `{}` — an open, unmerged pull request — so the `already_settled`
    guard stays inert for every test that is not about the concurrent-sweep race.

    `main_commits` / `pr_files` feed the tested-surface gate through the SAME
    `_request` seam production uses, so `ProofFreshness.build`, `files_of` and
    `pull_files` are exercised rather than stubbed. The synthetic proof-base SHA is
    listed immediately behind them; the default commit is a pipeline bake, so a test
    that is not about staleness keeps the neutral outcome.

    `compare_files` / `compare_status` answer the pre-merge live `base...head`
    compare (the clobbered-head invariant). The default MIRRORS `pr_files` — a
    live diff carrying the same real changes as the pull request's files view —
    so every test that is not about the invariant keeps its old outcome; a
    clobbered/empty head is staged with `compare_files=()`. The invariant judges
    the compare ALONE (the files view recomputes against a clobbered head, so a
    live-vs-view disagreement never occurs in practice — measured 2026-08-09).

    `hold_comments` seeds the GET `/issues/{n}/comments` page-1 response the
    recorded-hold guard reads immediately before the merge call; the default
    `None` answers an empty list (no hold) so every test that is not about the
    hold guard keeps its old outcome. `hold_comments_status` >= 400 simulates a
    comments-read failure (the guard's fail-closed path).

# merged anyway by the shared account, with no release comment. Fleet law already
# says a recorded hold binds every merge path (`DEC:SOL-HOLD-IS-A-MERGE-BARRIER`);
# these tests pin the automation that now enforces it.
#
# PR #6149's first cut matched a hold marker ANYWHERE in the text (`re.search`),
# which a live-corpus adversarial review (scratchpad/rev6149) falsified: ordinary
# PROSE ABOUT a hold — a records/handoff PR narrating the #6109 incident, or this
# very guard's own PR body explaining what it does — matched exactly as hard as a
# genuine declared hold. The fix set below (line-start marker contract, release
# precedence, quote-reply/bot-forgery closes, body-release asymmetry, cap-vs-error
# distinction, blocked_names isolation, and steady-state zero-label-churn) is
# tested here; several tests below are literal ports of the reviewer's own
# adversarial cases (scratchpad/rev6149/test_attack_6149.py), inverted where the
# fix changes the correct answer and left as regression coverage where it does not
# (documented per case).

    that has NOT CONCLUDED is no information. A concluded green is positive evidence
    about a real SHA; a queued run is the absence of evidence, and halting on absence
    is not fail-closed, it is fail-blind.

    `pending` one (06:45Z) stacked on top, so the breaker said `pending`. Each of the

    pull requests evaluated — for 8 merges in 24h against 43 PRs created.

# Measured 2026-08-07. READ_TOKEN is the job's own GITHUB_TOKEN, whose Actions
# quota is 1,000 requests/hour PER REPOSITORY. Sweep 31148157570 evaluated 93 armed
# pull requests for ~121 calls in 82 seconds; the workflow_run trigger produced
# 23-28 non-skipped sweeps in the 02Z hour. 28 x 121 = ~3,400 calls against a
# 1,000/hr bucket, so the bucket emptied, every later sweep 403'd on its FIRST call,
# and because sweeps kept firing they kept eating each hourly refill. Continuous
# failure 03:34Z-04:38Z, recovery at 04:39Z — one clean hourly window, which is the
# primary-quota signature rather than a secondary/burst throttle.
#
# A big backlog makes each sweep expensive -> the token starves -> nothing merges ->
# the backlog stays big. These tests pin the three places that loop is now cut.

# --- main's proof: resolved from WORKFLOW RUNS, never from a commit walk -------
#
# The refresh above can only fire if the sweeper knows what main currently proves, and
# for its first fortnight it never did. It asked by walking main's last 20 commits for
# one that published `ci-pack-*`, and on this repository that walk CANNOT succeed:
#
#   * ci.yml has no `push` trigger (`on:` is pull_request + workflow_dispatch), so main
#     is proven only by a manual `gh workflow run ci.yml --ref main`, a couple of times
#     a day at best;
#   * the nightly and wire lanes push ~24 `[skip ci]` / path-filtered commits to main
#     per 2 HOURS, publishing ambient checks (`sweep`, `wire`, `immune`, `monitor`, ...)
#     and never a pack.
#
# So the 20-commit window spanned ~100 minutes while main's newest real proof sat 117
# COMMITS / 12 HOURS back. Run live 2026-08-08 the walk returned 18 ambient names and
# ZERO packs, while 31 armed pull requests were blocked on `ci-pack-2` and 29 on
# `ci-pack-3` — all four packs `success` on main's newest ci.yml run (4b61c11a16f8).
# 48 armed pull requests, ~40 also `merge-blocked`, audited by a human every morning.
#
# PR #4968 fixed a different halt condition in the same walk and kept the fixed commit
# budget, so it worked the day it landed and decayed back. These tests pin the property
# that has no window to outgrow: the proof comes from the workflow RUN.

    FILTER, out of one pool of runs: the shipped code queries the newest run at ANY
    status, and an earlier revision queried `status=in_progress` then `status=queued`,
    so a fake that ignored the parameter would let either shape read as correct against
    fixtures written for the other. An unknown run id answers with a NAMED phantom job

    produce a name the assertions can see; without it "returned no names" passed for

    The dynamic matrix narrows what a PULL REQUEST publishes; it must not narrow

    base-inherited red (`bad_names <= proof.clean_names`). The mechanism that keeps

    worth pinning HERE is that the sweeper side collects whatever the run published,
    verbatim and without a name list of its own. `_run_clean_jobs` reads the job
    names straight off the API, so `ci-plan` and `ci-gate` join the proof for free
    and a pack red on a PR still finds its excuse.

    An earlier revision let `_run_clean_jobs` return `None` for two different facts —

    dated both `None`. `MainProof.age_hours` was then None, so the
    `age <= MAIN_PROOF_MAX_AGE_HOURS` gate could not fire; every sweep with a blocked
    pull request dispatched, the run came back red, and the next sweep dispatched
    again. Measured against the live shape of run 31220410022 (all four packs
    `failure`), 10 dispatches in 10 consecutive sweeps — and 4 of the newest 10 main
    ci.yml runs were `failure`, so this is the ordinary state of a red main, not a
    corner. Steady state ~164 hosted jobs/day against an intended ceiling of 8.

    The model here is the production steady state, which is what makes it a loop rather
    than a one-off: each dispatch produces a run that CONCLUDES RED, so nothing is ever
    "in flight" by the time the next sweep looks, and the newest run is always freshly
    created. Both repairs are load-bearing under it — the proof is now DATED by an
    all-red run (so the age gate closes it) and MAIN_BASELINE_MIN_INTERVAL_MINUTES
    bounds the rate even if it were not.

    Asserts the BOUND across the whole window, not which sweep won it: a test that

# merge_on_green short-circuits on integration-baseline BEFORE it looks at any pull
# request, and a never-concluding newest run reads as `pending`, which blocks ordinary
# merges. So the sweeper's throughput depends on a workflow it does not own.
#
# 2026-08-07: integration-baseline.yml carried `cancel-in-progress: true`, which cancels
# the RUNNING proof and not merely superseded pending ones. Source pushes land every 1-2
# minutes during a merge drain and the hosted queue sat 100-180 deep, so every run was
# killed before it acquired a runner: measured over ~3h the last 60 runs were 59
# cancelled + 1 running, ZERO success, newest success 5h stale. The sweeper reported
# "11 baseline-blocked" against a main that was green. The armed backlog could not drain
# because the proof that main is drainable was being cancelled by the drain's own pushes.
#
# `false` still coalesces — GitHub allows one pending run per group, so a newer push
# still supersedes an older PENDING proof — but the run holding a runner gets to finish.

# --- a red must ALWAYS leave a marker (PR #5291, 2026-08-11) -------------------
#
# The incident, from the label timeline and the run logs:
#
#   01:23:45Z  #5291 armed with `merge-on-green`
#   02:05:18Z  ci run 31449929887 concludes FAILURE on head 9ce3c2ef
#   02:13:32Z  a codex session execs `gh pr edit 5291 --remove-label merge-on-green`
#   02:13:34Z  the arm label is gone. No `merge-blocked`. No comment. No marker.
#   02:13:41Z  sweep 31451725301 lists the armed PRs — #5291 is already invisible
#   02:20:52Z  a builder re-arms it
#   02:21:36Z  the same session strips it again, still with no marker
#   02:32:52Z  a human admin-merges it by hand
#
# Two sweeper-side properties made the silent window possible, and both are pinned
# below. The `if:` gate skipped failure wake-ups, so the marker could only ride the
# ~0.5/hr cron or the next green anywhere in the repository — and once the arm label
# came off, a label-filtered sweep could never see the pull request again, so the
# marker could not arrive at all. And `mark_blocked` treated a failed label POST as
# a reason to skip the COMMENT too, which turns one unlucky HTTP status into a
# refusal that exists only in a run log.
#
# The disarm itself is not the sweeper's to prevent — `scripts/merge_on_green.py`
# has no code path that removes `merge-on-green`. That half is a fleet law, and it
# lives in CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md.
