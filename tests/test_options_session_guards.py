"""Weekend rows must not reach the options readers — the #3721 class, swept.

WHAT A WEEKEND ROW IS.  Several EOD options stores accrue a row on non-session days.  It
is NOT a harmless carry-forward duplicate: the builder RECOMPUTES iv30 / spot / walls /
net-GEX / skew off a stale carried-forward price, so the row is a fabricated observation
of a day that never traded.  Measured on the real stores, 2026-07-29:

    data/cboe/gex.parquet                     13 non-session rows of 39
    data/cboe/putcall.parquet                 13 non-session rows of 39  (same dates)
    data/options_skew/snapshots.parquet         8 non-session dates of 28
    data/options_ivspread/snapshots.parquet     6 non-session dates of 21
    data/polygon_gex/summary_*.parquet        ~11 non-session dates of 39
    data/polygon_gex/chains/{DATE}.parquet     11 non-session snapshot files of 39
    data/flows/broad_flow_proxy.parquet         5 non-session dates of 15
    (clean: options_flow/summary_* 0 of 136, tape_flow/daily 0 of 4,
     options_entry/state 0 of 3, market_structure/ledger 0 of 6;
     index_gex_history/SPY 1 of 2388, dated 2019-02-02)

SUPERSEDED FOR THE TWO polygon_gex LINES (2026-08-06).  Those rows were not weekend
recomputes of a session that had passed — they were the UTC RUN date, one session AHEAD
of the closing chain each file actually held, so no reader filter could recover the right
date.  ``scripts/migrate_polygon_gex_session_stamps.py`` re-stamped the store to the
session each snapshot describes; it now holds 24 chains files and 8,062 summary rows with
ZERO non-session stamps.  The guards below therefore split into two properties — the raw
store is session-clean at the SOURCE, and the readers would still drop a planted
non-session row — because "the reader drops something" is no longer a premise the real
store can supply.

Left in, one weekend row corrupts THREE things at once:
  1. ``.iloc[-1]`` — the "latest" reading can be a Saturday recompute;
  2. percentile / quantile windows — fabricated points inside the distribution a
     threshold is measured against;
  3. POSITIONAL lookbacks — ``.iloc[-6]`` stops meaning "5 sessions ago", and any
     ``n_obs`` count used as an activation gate is padded with non-trading days.

(3) was live: ``build_leader_radar._load_options_skew``'s ``min_obs=21`` gate read the
store's 28 dates as 28 observations, so ``call_skew_rich`` — chip 6 of the seven-chip
CROWDED state gate — was firing for 350 of 401 names on a count of which 8 were weekends.
Filtered, the real session count is 20 and every name is correctly null until the 21st.

Two canonical fixes existed (build_market_structure._read_gex_spx #F3-11/#F3-12,
build_options_screener._load_gex_summary #F3-17); this sweep extends the idiom to the
readers they missed, via the shared ``lib.nyse_calendar.session_rows`` /
``session_dates`` helpers — and then kills the class at the source with write-side gates
on the two writers that mint these rows (see TestCboeCollectorSessionGate /
TestPolygonChainsSessionGate at the bottom of this file).

        TWO THINGS MOVE THE SPAN OFF SIX, IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS (2026-08-06).

          * FEWER sessions than rows — the reader let a non-session (or a duplicated
            date) into the window, so ``iloc[-6]`` is nearer than five sessions back.
            That is this file's defect class; it stays a hard failure.

          * MORE sessions than rows — the STORE never holds those sessions, because
            the collector did not run.  ``polygon_gex`` is chronically gappy and
            always has been: measured on ``summary_AAPL`` at 2026-08-06, SIX sessions
            are absent from its 37-session span, and three of them (07-06, 07-15,
            07-17) predate the 08-03..08-05 nightly outage that finally pushed a hole
            into the six-row tail window.  No repo change heals a collector outage,
            and while this was asserted as a flat ``== 6`` the whole merge queue was
            hostage to the options collector's uptime — it took ci-pack-2 red on main
            and blocked 56 armed PRs.  The gap is reported, not asserted.

        So the flat equality is replaced by the reader contract it was standing in
        for, asserted DIRECTLY against the real store (and non-vacuously: the raw
        store still carries fabricated rows, which is asserted first).  The residual
        risk the equality used to cover — a gap making the shipped
        ``opt_vanna_hedge_5d`` a nine-session change rather than a five-session one —
        was CLOSED on 2026-08-06: ``_vanna_hedge_5d_from_summary`` resolves its far
        endpoint by CALENDAR (``engine.options_stamp._row_n_sessions_back``), so only
        the two endpoints matter and a gap now has exactly two legal outcomes — the
        5-back session HAS a row and the stat recovers exactly (an interior hole is
        irrelevant to a difference), or it does NOT and the stat is null.  A widened
        basis is no longer reachable, which is why step (4) reports the gap rather
        than asserting on it.  (See TestFiveSessionEndpointIsCalendarResolved at the

# ══════════════════ GAP: a session-true snapshot list is still not a DENSE one ══
#
# Session-filtering guarantees every snapshot IS a session.  It cannot guarantee every
# session HAS a snapshot, and polygon_gex is chronically gappy — four interior holes in the
# 31 committed chain dates, the largest being the 2026-08-03..08-05 collection outage.  The
# snapshot API is current-only, so no backfill is possible, ever.
#
# Positional slicing then lies a SECOND way, independent of the weekend-row class above:
# `usable[-6:]` still returns six rows but they span NINE sessions at as_of 2026-08-06, and
# `usable[-2]` is FOUR sessions back rather than one.  These tests pin the two different
# honest answers — re-weight the fit, refuse the two-snapshot comparisons — against the real
# outage geometry.
