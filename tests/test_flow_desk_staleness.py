"""The alarm site/flowdata/desk.json did not have.

The desk declared ``cadence: "daily"`` and sat 12 days stale — its A-share legs
pinned at 2026-07-24 while southbound advanced to 08-05 beside them — and
nothing anywhere went red. The artifact was rewritten nightly, so every
mtime-, existence- and "did the builder run" check read healthy; the only
consumer that checks freshness (engine/cn_theme_tape, 7-day budget) responded by
silently dropping its flow chips, which is indistinguishable from "no flow today".

Upstream, the same outage reported 'ok' ten nights running because
ChinaTushareAdapter's only series is a heartbeat stamped ``utcnow()`` — fresh by
construction, so the collector framework's freshness machinery could never see
the frozen ``data/tushare/*.parquet`` stores behind it.

These tests are built to fail on that class of defect:
  · a partial freeze (one dead leg among healthy siblings) must be flagged
  · a market holiday (every leg frozen together) must NOT be flagged
  · a TOTAL freeze must still be caught — the case the relative gate is blind to
  · a deliberately discontinued leg must never cry wolf
  · a collector run that collected nothing must not report itself healthy
