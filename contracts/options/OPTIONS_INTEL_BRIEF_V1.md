# Contract — `options.intel_brief/v1` (`intel_brief_heuristic/v1.2`)

Code-facing executable contract for the Daily EOD Options Intelligence Brief.
Sources of authority, in order: the program masterplan
(`research/ADVANCED_DATA_OPTIONS_EOD_DARK_POOL_INTELLIGENCE_OS_MASTERPLAN_2026-08-17.md`),
`DEC:AD1-DIRECTION-AUTHORITY-SEPARATES-SALIENCE-MECHANICS-AND-DIRECTION`,
`DEC:AD-SIGNAL-VOCAB-RESTORES-SHORT`, and the amended AD-1 handoff §5.3 (v1.2)
(`research/ADVANCED_DATA_OPTIONS_EOD_AD1_DAILY_INTELLIGENCE_BRIEF_HANDOFF_2026-08-17.md`),
plus the AD-1 runtime source-clock ruling (settled vs pending, 2026-08-18) and the Sol
review Block B1-B4 fix (2026-08-18, PR #5872 REQUEST_CHANGES — receipt closure, the
two-gate coverage law, evidence-derived freshness, and the two-domain Prophet mapping)
transcribed here. Implementation is transcription: any divergence between code and this
contract is a defect in exactly one of them and must be returned, never silently adapted.

Producer: `scripts/build_options_intel_brief.py` → `engine/options_intel_brief.py` (pure).
Artifact: `site/options_intel_brief.json` (atomic write; semantic no-op on unchanged receipt).
Consumer (AD-1): `scripts/build_options_command.py` → `templates/options.html.j2` (pass-through
adapter; zero recomputation). No Prophet/Neural-Web/Sector/Terminal consumer in AD-1.
Authority: display-tier research-priority ONLY. Deterministic; no network; no LLM anywhere
in the authoritative path.

## 1. Source-clock law (settled vs pending; supersedes any T+0 wiring)

The chain snapshot and OI are on different knowledge clocks: a snapshot dated `D` carries
the OI print attributable to the PRIOR session. Full directional scoring therefore uses the
newest lawful pair of consecutive NYSE sessions:

```text
S = settled research session          (the session the board is ABOUT)
D = next_nyse_session(S)              (the snapshot whose OI count is attributable to S)
require: chain[S] exists AND chain[D] exists AND D == next_nyse_session(S)
```

- IV / volume / skew / spot / same-session features: from `chain[S]` ONLY.
- `Q_oi` for S: contract-matched OI change over the lawful `S → D` pair. `oi_counted_date = D`.
- NO non-OI field from `D` may leak into the S research state (test 24).
- Same-day OI (treating chain[S]'s own OI column as S's settled OI) is UNLAWFUL for Q_oi (test 25).
- If the newest two stored sessions are not consecutive NYSE sessions, walk backward to the
  newest lawful consecutive pair and disclose the gap (test 26). NYSE calendar = the repo's
  existing session arithmetic helper (`engine` trading-calendar utilities); never raw calendar days.
- If a chain session newer than S exists without its next-session OI print: header carries
  `pending_session = <date>`, `pending_reason = "OI_NOT_YET_SETTLED"`. The pending session is
  NEVER scored, never directional, and never mixed into S cards (test 27).
- Historical windows: only observations lawfully available at build time for S.
- GEX mechanics (`gex_confirm_verdict`) may set `M_gex` only when its evidence binds to S
  (artifact as-of == S). Otherwise the mechanics family is ABSENT and `M_gex = 1.0`; never
  borrow next-session mechanics (test 28).
- Prophet display context may be newer than S (`prophet_asof` shown); zero rank authority (test 29).
- Any core mixed-vintage failure → `board_state = "DEGRADED"`, `board_reason = "MIXED_VINTAGE"`;
  an optional family simply goes absent if the core state stays coherent. Never zero-fill.

## 1a. Two gates (B2 — SOURCE_COVERAGE_GATE is SEPARATE from ELIGIBILITY_GATE)

Two different failure modes used to share one constant (`ELIGIBILITY_GATE`), which
collapsed "is chain[S] itself a plausible full snapshot" and "how many present names
individually have enough data" into a single number. They are now two independent gates,
checked in this order:

```text
1. Source coverage (board-level):
   source_coverage_pct = |present_names ∩ universe| / |universe|
   universe = producer-resolved engine/options_universe.py::gex_symbols() (input #7)
   source_coverage_pct < SOURCE_COVERAGE_GATE (0.90)
     -> board_state = "INSUFFICIENT_COVERAGE" (cards withheld)
   NEVER derived from any historical chain session's own name count (the deleted
   "historical-max" heuristic) — a session with no explicit universe override defaults
   to asserting 100% of ITS OWN present names, never borrowing another session's count.
2. Eligibility (per-name data quality, unchanged threshold):
   eligible/present < ELIGIBILITY_GATE (0.60)
     -> board_state = "DEGRADED", board_reason = "ELIGIBILITY_COLLAPSE" (cards withheld)
```

The header's `eligibility` block additionally reports `universe_count` and
`source_coverage_pct` (rounded 4dp) on EVERY payload where a chain[S] was loaded at all
(not only on the `INSUFFICIENT_COVERAGE` branch) — `null` only when undecidable
(`MIXED_VINTAGE`, no chain ever loaded).

## 2. Inputs (read-only; existing loaders only)

**AD-1T0 source cutover (2026-08-22, `DEC:AD-OPTIONS-CANONICAL-SOURCE-THETADATA`,
frozen spec `research/AD1T0_THETADATA_CUTOVER_SPEC_2026-08-22.md`).** Chairman
ruling: ThetaData is the canonical Mastermind options source. The producer no
longer reads the legacy `data/polygon_gex/` estate at all (inputs #1/#2 below) and
GEX mechanics (input #3) is HARD-DISABLED — `site/gex/*.json`/`engine.gex_confirm`
is legacy-Polygon-estate provenance, never read again until a future
ThetaData-native mechanics wave. `engine/options_intel_brief.py` (v1.2 semantics)
and `engine/thetadata_store.py` are BYTE-UNCHANGED by this cutover.

| # | Input | Path | Used for | Clock |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | EOD/OI/greeks chains | ThetaData T1 store (`engine.thetadata_store.resolve_thetadata_store()`, tiers `eod/{ROOT}/{YEAR}.parquet`, `oi/{ROOT}/{YEAR}.parquet`, `greeks/{ROOT}/{YEAR}.parquet`); the producer builds its own per-contract frames with narrow projected reads (`chain()`/`make_chain_provider()` are PROHIBITED on this path) | eligibility, V family, salience buckets, Q_skew, Q_oi (S→D pair), C family, market-implied move | S (eod+oi+greeks); D — OI tier ONLY. No eod[D]/greeks[D] VALUE is ever materialised into a scored frame — the barrier is a FILTERING guarantee, not a never-opened one (corrected wording, review round 2026-08-22): D-dated eod identity/date columns may legitimately be read for §3's session-presence counting, and those counts bind `receipt_id` via `session_presence` |
| 2 | Spot / summary-spot authority | §D spot ladder: rung 1 = ThetaData greeks `underlying_price` (per-root session median); rung 2 = `engine.price_ladder.resolve_close()` (adjusted-only, exact-date match); rung 3 = absent (drops the name). `summary_spot` = per-session median greeks `underlying_price`, trailing LOOKBACK+1 committed sessions ≤ S (rung-1 raw basis only) | RV for v2, spot-extension c2, flip proximity display | rows ≤ S only |
| 3 | gex_confirm | **HARD-DISABLED (§E, 2026-08-22).** `site/gex/{SYM}.json`/`engine.gex_confirm.assess` is never read; `gex_verdict` is permanently empty | mechanics context always `None`; `M_gex ≡ 1.0` unconditionally | n/a — never bound to any session |
| 4 | Earnings calendar | `data/earnings/earnings.parquet` (`next_date` per ticker) | E family event window (S, S+45d] | forward-known |
| 5 | Prophet display context (TWO domains, B4) | `site/prophet/index.json`: `plans[]` (`asset`, `entry_status`, `lifecycle_state`, `closed`) AND `intake.receipts.groups` (bucket `reason` + `names[].ticker`) | display-only `prophet_state` chip, resolved per §5's two-domain precedence | may be newer than S; `prophet_asof` disclosed |
| 6 | Flow signing gate | `data/options_flow/signing_gate.json` | proves `Q_flow` must stay ABSENT while `direction_reliable == false` | current |
| 7 | Options universe (B2) | `engine/options_universe.py::gex_symbols()` (config anchors + baskets, capped) | `SOURCE_COVERAGE_GATE` denominator; producer-resolved, passed to the pure engine as an explicit list+count | current; NEVER derived from the chain store's own historical session sizes |

No collector is invoked; no network; missing optional input → family absent; missing core
input (chains for the pair) → `STALE_SOURCE`/`DEGRADED` per §5. Off-host self-skip (§G):
when `resolve_thetadata_store(required=False)` resolves to nothing (e.g. a GitHub runner
without the store), the producer prints a `::warning` naming every path tried and exits 0
leaving the committed artifact untouched — never `required=True`, never a crash.

**B1 — receipt closure (F1 extends this, 2026-08-18; re-sourced to ThetaData by
AD-1T0, 2026-08-22).** Every score-affecting per-symbol input the producer
actually reads must bind the receipt: the derived spot/summary-spot authority
manifest (input #2) for every name present in chain[S] — rung-2 price-ladder
files actually consumed plus the derived spot-history slices, logical URIs under
`thetadata://spot_history/{SYM}` / `priceladder://resolve_close/{SYM}` — and, per
per-(session, tier) row digests over CONSUMED columns only (identity + the
score-affecting value column; never a whole-year file hash, which the nightly
re-pull would churn on every run), **every ThetaData (session, tier) slice
actually opened** (input #1): all sessions ≤ S consumed for d1/d3/Q_oi/skew
HISTORY across the `eod`/`oi`/`greeks` tiers, plus D's `oi` tier alone. A
historical (< S) session contributes to every history-dependent feature and is
hashed into the closure the same as S itself (the F1 fix, preserved verbatim
across the cutover) — mutating one moves `receipt_id`. D's `eod`/`greeks` tiers
are never MATERIALISED into any scored frame — every VALUE load stays bounded
≤ S — but the leak barrier is a FILTERING guarantee, not a never-opened one
(corrected wording, review round 2026-08-22): session-presence counting for the
§3 pair predicate necessarily reads identity/date columns across the candidate
range in every tier, including a D-dated eod probe when such rows exist, and
those presence counts bind into the **`session_presence`** receipt below — so a
D-dated row-population change that could move `as_of_session` still always
moves `receipt_id`, even though it can never move a VALUE into the board. The
producer hashes exactly this consumed set (never the whole store) into a
deterministic `source_manifest` (§5) and folds a merkle-style aggregate root
per domain (`gex_summary`, `gex_confirm`, and `chains`) into `input_receipts`
— see §5's `receipt_id` formula, which already hashes the full `input_receipts`
list, so the three roots are what actually binds them. `gex_confirm`'s domain
is permanently empty (§E hard-disable). `input_receipts` also carries a
**`universe_resolution`** entry (F1): `sha256
(canonical_json(sorted(universe_list))) + count` over the resolved universe (input
#7) — the resolved universe now binds into `receipt_id` too, same as every other §2
source — plus AD-1T0's **`store_resolution`** (the resolver SOURCE TAG —
env/data_dir/ops-wt — never the absolute path, so a host/path migration with
identical data does not churn `receipt_id`; the resolved absolute path and any
corrupt/unreadable year-file count are recorded in the diagnostic `_run` block
and the receipt's own `corrupt_files` count, never only a debug log, review
round m5/m6), **`spot_authority`** (per-symbol spot rung 1/2/3 used, sha256 over
the rung map, AND — for every rung-2 symbol — the consumed resolved close
VALUE, the ladder `price_source` tag, and the series last index date, so a
rung-2 close change moves `receipt_id`, review round BLOCKER B2), and
**`session_presence`** (sha256 over (a) the ordered per-candidate `(session,
plaus_bool, balanced_bool)` decision tuples, plus (b) the exact `(n_eod,
n_oi)` counts for ONLY the decision-critical sessions — the final history
anchor, every demoted session, and the OI-only frontier candidate — narrowed
from the original all-candidate-counts form, verify round N2, 2026-08-22).

**F2a — universe resolution fails CLOSED (producer-only).** After resolving input
#7, if the config says `include_baskets: true` but the resolved universe came back
no larger than the config anchor list — the OBSERVABLE signature of
`options_universe.baskets_universe()`'s own swallowed-error empty return (that
function logs and returns `[]` on any read failure, by design, rather than raising)
— the board fails CLOSED: `board_state = "DEGRADED"`, `board_reason =
"UNIVERSE_RESOLUTION_FAILED"`, cards withheld. `engine/options_universe.py` is a
shared plane and is NEVER edited for this check; the probe lives entirely in
`scripts/build_options_intel_brief.py`.

## 4. Feature semantics (v1.2 — see AD-1 handoff §5.3 for prose law)

- `d1`, `d3`, `D_salience`: UNSIGNED salience. Zero direction meaning.
- `Q_oi = d2`: contract-matched (strike_ticker join, expiry > D-measurement basis, per-contract
  positive ΔOI on each side) robust z of r = (callΔOI − putΔOI)/(callΔOI + putΔOI + ε) over
  min(60, available) history, floor 10; clamp ±3 → /3. Unsigned positioning HYPOTHESIS; never
  "observed buying/selling".
- `Q_skew`: robust z of `delta_skew_t = skew_t − skew_{t−1}` (skew = (25Δput IV − 25Δcall IV)/ATM IV,
  7–60 DTE) over min(20, available) prior delta-skew observations, floor 8; `Q_skew = −clamp(z,±3)/3`.
  CHANGE, never level.
- `Q_flow`: ABSENT while `signing_gate.direction_reliable == false`. Structural — no code path
  may compute it (activation = new model_version + review).
- Direction: `LONG = Q_oi ≥ +0.50 ∧ Q_skew ≥ +0.50 ∧ D_salience ≥ 0.60`; SHORT mirrored.
  Zero-authority list (may never originate/strengthen direction): d1, d3, raw volume, premium,
  volume/OI, tick-rule flow, GEX, gex_confirm_verdict, walls/flip, 0DTE share, event premium.
- Fallback routing: |F_V| ≥ 0.60 or |F_E| ≥ 0.50 → VOLATILITY; C-fire → RISK_ONLY; else
  NEUTRAL → reported as NO_SIGNAL when R < 100.
- `F_V = mean(s_v1, s_v2, s_v3)` (present members); v1 ATM-IV percentile is longitudinal-only;
  v2 = (ATM IV − RV)/RV, RV from summary-spot log returns over min(20, H−1), floor 10, XS-ranked;
  v3 term slope blended (0.5 XS tier-peers + 0.5 longitudinal).
- `F_E` (cross-sectional mode ONLY at AD-1): needs ≥5 event names; `0.6·(2·p_xs_event − 1) +
  0.4·(2·p_long_iv − 1)` clamped. `history_mode = "cross_sectional"`;
  `event_premium_state ∈ {LOW, NORMAL, HIGH}` (LOW: p_xs ≤ 0.25; HIGH: p_xs ≥ 0.75; else NORMAL).
  Forbidden vocabulary before historical activation: "underpriced/overpriced event move",
  "historical move says …".
- C family: c1 = XS rank of 0DTE volume share (≥0.90 fires); c2 = v1 ≥ 0.95 AND spot ≥ 0.98×
  max spot over min(20,H) (floor 10); c3 = d1 ≥ 0.95 ∧ d3 ≥ 0.5 ∧ v2 ≥ 0.90. Severity =
  max(fired inputs).
  - **c1 cross-section COVERAGE PREDICATE (F4a, 2026-08-18)**: c1 is computed ONLY
    when the finite-`sd_share` population is ≥ `C1_XS_MIN_PRESENT_SHARE` (0.50) of
    present names — a coverage predicate ("does the cross-section exist market-wide"),
    explicitly NOT a scoring threshold. A thin session (e.g. 11-16 finite of ~350
    present) could clear the absolute `MIN_HISTORY`(10) floor alone while
    representing <5% of the market, letting a couple of names self-certify as
    "crowded" against a near-empty peer set; below the share, c1 = None
    universe-wide for that session (honest family absence).
  - Cross-sectional percentile convention (`percentile_xs`, crowding-defect ruling,
    2026-08-18, `MODEL_VERSION` unchanged at v1.2 — this is a primitive-correctness fix,
    not a semantic model revision): MIDRANK ties — `p = (count_strictly_less + 0.5·count_equal) / n`. A
    member of a tied block ranks at the block's MIDPOINT, never the top of the block.
    Applies to every `percentile_xs` caller (c1, v2, v3-XS-half, event F_E); does NOT
    apply to `percentile_long` (its histories are proven non-degenerate — changing it
    would perturb frozen v1/d1 longitudinal semantics, out of scope this wave).
  - `sd_share` (c1's input) requires a nonzero same-day (≤`SD_DTE`) volume sum: an empty
    ≤1.5-DTE slice OR a zero-volume slice both resolve `sd_share = None`, not `0.0` — a
    literal same-day share of exactly zero is definitionally "no same-day tape", not
    same-day crowding. `c1` is then the midrank percentile over the remaining FINITE
    `sd_share` members only (peers with `sd_share = None` are excluded from the
    cross-section entirely, same as any other missing peer value); with fewer than
    `MIN_HISTORY` (10) finite members, `c1 = None` universe-wide — honest family
    absence, not a fired leg. Ruling note: a member of a tied block ranks at the
    block's midpoint, so a degenerate-mass block (e.g. a session where most names
    carry `sd_share = 0.0`, formerly ranked at the block's top under plain `<=`
    comparison) can no longer self-certify as extreme.
- `evidence_strength`: directional = clamp01(0.70·mean(|Q_oi|,|Q_skew|) + 0.30·D_salience);
  VOLATILITY = |F_E| if E present else |F_V| (evidence EXTREMITY); RISK_ONLY = C severity.
- `evidence_confidence = min(ceil, 0.30 + 0.10·[d3 ≥ 0.5] + 0.05·[coverage complete])`;
  ceil = 0.45 directional / 0.60 otherwise. Bands per CONF_BANDS; display words only.
- `M_ad = tier × fresh × event × crowd × M_gex`. Prophet multiplier DOES NOT EXIST (=1.0).
- `research_priority_score R = round(1000 · evidence_strength · evidence_confidence · M_ad)`.
- Boards: opportunities = direction ∈ {LONG, SHORT, VOLATILITY} ∧ R ≥ 250, sort (−R,
  −evidence_confidence, −tier_metric, symbol), cap 6 with overflow count; event board ≤ 4 by
  |F_E|; risk board ≤ 4 by severity; `no_signal_exemplar` = highest-tier-metric eligible
  coverage-complete name with R < 100.
- Market-implied move: 5-session horizon `ATM_IV·√(5/252)`; next-session `ATM_IV·√(1/252)`;
  event horizon per E-family front-expiry math; else null. Label: "Market-implied movement
  range" — never target/forecast.
- Horizons: LONG/SHORT and non-event VOLATILITY `"next_5_sessions"`; event VOLATILITY
  `"through_event_close"`; RISK_ONLY/0DTE `"next_session"` (later named clock wins).
- Trigger/invalidation: deterministic templates from Q/V/E/C state exactly per AD-1 handoff
  §5.3 (LONG/SHORT trigger = same-sign ∧ |Q| ≥ 0.50 next settled session; invalidation =
  agreement lost ∨ |Q| < 0.25 ∨ source stale/degraded). Closed vocabulary; no LLM.
- `fresh_until` (B3 — evidence-derived freshness, binding): the MINIMUM lawful expiry
  over the card's ACTUAL contribution set — every evidence input that entered `state`
  (direction/route classification), `evidence_strength`, `evidence_confidence`, or
  `M_ad`. Never derived from direction alone. Session-count lives (`FRESH_LIVES_SESSIONS`,
  §3) convert to real NYSE-session dates; the E-family life (`event_close`) is an actual
  calendar date, combined with everything else via `min()`.
  - LONG/SHORT: Q_oi(3) + Q_skew(3) + D_salience(3) always (the direction law requires
    all three present) `+` P/GEX-mechanics(1) when `M_gex ≠ 1.0` (a qualified LONG under
    caution) `+` the fired crowd leg's own life when a crowd multiplier cut this LONG's
    actionability `+` the event-close date (**F3a, 2026-08-18**) whenever the event
    contamination multiplier actually entered `M_ad` for this card (the same
    `event_imminent` gate `actionability()` used, never merely "in the 45d event
    window") — a LONG whose `M_ad` was genuinely cut by an imminent event must not
    claim freshness past that event's close. A qualified LONG with `M_gex=0.75` ->
    `fresh_until` = next session (life 1 wins the min). A LONG cut by the crowd
    multiplier where the firing leg is same-day `c1` -> current-session expiry (life 0).
  - Crowd leg lives (used for RISK_ONLY too, always crowd-fired by construction — the
    only route to RISK_ONLY): `c1` (same-day/0DTE) = 0; `c2` (V(5) + spot-history(5)) =
    5; `c3` (min(D_salience(3), V(5))) = 3. Multiple fired legs -> the MIN across them.
  - VOLATILITY: the event-close date joins whenever the event contamination entered
    the route (F_E contributed), refined by `min()` against D_salience(3) when the
    confidence d3 persist-bonus also applied. **F3b (2026-08-18)**: the V(5) life is
    ALSO included whenever the V family genuinely contributed to the route
    (`f_v_active`) OR the card is non-event-driven — "event-driven ALONE" (V
    excluded) only holds when F_E is the sole contributor; a GIS-class row where
    BOTH F_E and F_V contributed becomes `min(event_close, V(5), d3-bonus-life)`,
    never event-close alone (the pre-fix defect: V's tighter life was silently
    dropped whenever any F_E reading existed, even a far one outside V's own
    5-session life).
  - The confidence d3 persist-bonus (`evidence_confidence`'s `[d3 ≥ 0.5]` term) is
    ITSELF salience evidence (life 3) and folds into every direction's contribution set
    — a no-op for LONG/SHORT (D_salience(3) is already unconditionally present there).
  - NEUTRAL (no lawful positive claim): life 0 -> `fresh_until` = S.
  - Display-only background (absent families, the Prophet chip) never shortens —
    neither ever enters the contribution set; there is no parameter for either in the
    freshness computation (structural, not merely untested).

## 5a. B5 — directional watch, event/risk overflow counts, no-signal reason (additive)

Nine fields, every one a projection of state the engine already computes — no new
score, threshold, cap, sort, or Prophet effect. The UI performs no sorting, filtering,
or re-ranking of any array below; each is emitted in its authoritative order and
consumed as-is.

                                         neither leg active -> "both readings are
                                           inside their normal range" (default,
                                           no suffix — this entry never claimed

                                       Producer-side so the UI stays dumb; null only
                                       when no_signal_exemplar itself is null.
```

All four empty-header builders (`_degraded_payload`/`_stale_payload`/
`_insufficient_coverage_payload`/MIXED_VINTAGE) emit these nine fields at their empty
defaults (`[]`/`0`/`0`) — the fields are always present, never absent-by-branch.

Prophet mapping (B4, display only — reads BOTH domains of `site/prophet/index.json`;
never affects any score):

- **plans[] domain** (`entry_status`/`lifecycle_state`/`closed`): `hold`/`partial` →
  ALREADY_OPEN, but ONLY while the plan is still open (`closed` False) — a closed
  hold/partial plan is a lawful-but-unmapped record → OTHER. `entry_status` `None` →
  ALREADY_OPEN only for an open (`closed` False) `entered` plan; any other `None`-status
  record → OTHER. `bounce_wait` → NOT_READY. `buy_now` → READY. `extended`/`topping` →
  EXTENDED (these last three resolve unconditionally — the open-condition above is
  stated only for the hold/partial and `None`-status cases).
- **intake.receipts.groups domain** (bucket `reason`, `names[].ticker`): `ran_too_far`
  (and any `extended`/`topping` bucket) → EXTENDED; `already_open` → ALREADY_OPEN;
  `not_ready`/`wait_pullback`/`bounce_wait` → NOT_READY; `buy_now` → READY;
  `stood_down`/`conviction_low`/`pointing_down`/`plan_not_built` and any other lawful
  bucket → OTHER.
- **Per-symbol precedence** when the two domains disagree for the same ticker (real
  collisions exist — e.g. BIIB: plans[].entry_status=`bounce_wait` → NOT_READY, but
  receipts.groups reason=`ran_too_far` → EXTENDED):
  `EXTENDED > ALREADY_OPEN > NOT_READY > READY > OTHER > UNAVAILABLE`.
- **Same-domain duplicate-ticker precedence (F13, 2026-08-18)**: a ticker can ALSO
  appear in more than one `intake.receipts.groups` bucket within the SAME file
  (e.g. both `not_ready` and `ran_too_far` for one symbol). The producer's
  group-reason keep resolves by this SAME ruled precedence, never by
  array/file order — a plain keep-first was rendering a genuinely
  `ran_too_far`/EXTENDED name as "Entry not ready yet" whenever `not_ready`
  happened to be enumerated first.
- Absent from BOTH domains → UNAVAILABLE. Never blank.
- OTHER's display words are `"Reviewed · no entry call"` / `"已评估 · 无入场判定"`
  (EXTENDED/ALREADY_OPEN/NOT_READY/READY/UNAVAILABLE words unchanged) — the word table
  itself lives in `scripts/build_options_command.py` (`_AIB_PROPHET_EN`/`_AIB_PROPHET_ZH`,
  outside this packet's OWNED FILES; the enum-level resolution above is complete and
  correct as of this contract, and the downstream word swap for OTHER **IS applied**
  (F14, 2026-08-18 — the prior "not yet applied" note was itself stale; verify against
  `_AIB_PROPHET_EN["OTHER"]` in that file).

## 6. Authority table

| Quantity | May do | May never do |
|---|---|---|
| D_salience, d1, d3 | raise research priority | carry/imply direction |
| Q_oi, Q_skew | originate LONG/SHORT jointly under the law | act alone; be described as observed buying/selling |
| Q_flow | (absent) | exist while signing gate direction_reliable=false |
| gex_confirm | display context; M_gex 0.75 on qualified LONG under caution | originate/strengthen direction; any positive multiplier; synthetic SHORT inverse |
| F_V, F_E | route VOLATILITY; evidence extremity | equity direction |
| C family | RISK_ONLY route; cut LONG actionability | direction |
| Prophet echo | display chip + prophet_asof | touch strength/confidence/M_ad/R; create/destroy/reorder hypotheses |
| Whole board | order research attention (display tier) | probability/alpha/forecast/trade authority; the word "validated" |

## 7. Writer contract

Atomic write via the house pattern (temp + rename). Semantic no-op: if a rerun produces an
identical `receipt_id` AND identical semantic payload, leave bytes/mtime unchanged and do not
churn git. If the same `as_of_session` later sees different source bytes (pre-AD-2): write the
corrected artifact with its new receipt; git history preserves the prior version; no formal
correction chain is claimed (`supersedes_signal_id`/`corrected_at` stay null placeholders).

## 8. Data-feasibility law (test-enforced)

Every history-dependent CONFIG constant must be satisfiable by ≥60% of names present in the
latest committed session of the real store at test time (`needs_full_checkout`-marked test).
A spec change demanding more depth than the canonical producer supplies must fail CI.

## 9. Known limits (recorded; out of scope this wave)

- `d1`'s max-over-~12-discrete-bucket-ranks construction (§4) inflates: under exchangeability
  `P(max over ~12 roughly-independent percentile ranks ≥ 0.95) ≈ 0.60` (debugger-verified,
  2026-08-18), i.e. `d1 ≥ 0.95` fires far more often than a single-percentile 5% base rate
  would suggest. Recorded as a v1.3 candidate (tighten the bucket-rank aggregation or the
  `D1_PERSIST_TH`/`C3_D1` thresholds against the inflated distribution); NOT touched by the
  crowding-defect fix above — `d1`/`d3` aggregation is explicitly out of scope for that ruling.
- **Universe + earnings calendar are AS-OF-NOW vintage (E1 review, 2026-08-18).** Both
  `engine/options_universe.py::gex_symbols()` (§2 input #7) and
  `data/earnings/earnings.parquet` (§2 input #4) are read at BUILD TIME with no
  point-in-time (PIT) store behind either — a backfilled or corrected historical
  build re-reads TODAY's universe/calendar, not the vintage that was actually live
  on the as-of-session in question. No PIT store exists for either input yet;
  minting one is explicitly OUT OF SCOPE for this wave (a genuine new data-plane
  commitment, not a scoring fix). Every receipt this contract mints (including F1's
  `universe_resolution` entry) still binds the ACTUAL bytes/list read at build time —
  the limitation is vintage fidelity for reconstruction, not receipt honesty.
- **Risk rail is currently c3-DOMINATED, pending the v1.3 `d1` revisit (E1 review,
  2026-08-18).** Sampled against the real committed store (2026-08-12 session,
  `--ignore-staleness`): of the crowding-fired rows surfaced across every board that
  session, `c3` fired in 5 of 6 and `c2` in 2 of 6 (some rows fire both); `c1` fired
  in none this session. This is the DIRECT consequence of the `d1` inflation
  documented above — `c3` requires `d1 ≥ 0.95 ∧ d3 ≥ 0.5 ∧ v2 ≥ 0.90`, and since
  `d1 ≥ 0.95` alone already fires at ≈60% (not the ≈5% its threshold implies), `c3`'s
  necessary condition is far more common than the CONFIG numbers alone suggest,
  making it the highest-base-rate leg of the C family well before `d3`/`v2` narrow
  it further. F4a's coverage predicate (this wave) fixes `c1`'s THIN-SESSION false
  positive but does not touch `d1`'s own aggregation — recorded here as the SAME
  v1.3 candidate named above, now with its concrete downstream symptom.
- **`directional_watch[]`/`event_board[]` ship FULL card bodies as a
  forward-compatible projection (E1 review, 2026-08-18) — intentional, not hidden
  intelligence.** Both arrays carry the complete card shape (§5), not a thin
  reference, even though the current AD-1 UI only renders a few fields from each
  (contract §5a). This is deliberate: it lets a future consumer (or a UI revision)
  read richer detail without a producer/contract change, and every field is already
  governed by the SAME authority table (§6) as the boards that do render fully — no
  additional score/rank/threshold leaks through the wider shape.
- **`FRESH_PENALTY` (0.5) is structurally unreachable at build time by construction
  (E1 review, 2026-08-18).** `fresh_ok` is `True` unless `p_v2` (the V-family
  spot-history spread) is present AND `hist_spot` is empty — but `p_v2` can only be
  non-None when `percentile_xs` already found `spreads[n]`, which itself requires
  `len(window) >= MIN_HISTORY` sessions of `hist_spot` to have computed `rv` in the
  first place (§4 V family `v2`). A `p_v2` that is present therefore implies
  `hist_spot` was non-empty at computation time, and `fresh_ok`'s check reads the
  SAME `hist_spot` list — the two conditions cannot disagree given how the
  producer's own per-session loading works today. Recorded as a known structural
  no-op, not a new defect; changing it (e.g. an independently-staled summary store)
  is out of scope for this wave.
- **`verify_shots/adib2_*.png` provenance is the `--ignore-staleness` diagnostic
  build, not the committed artifact (E1 review, 2026-08-18).** The committed
  `site/options_intel_brief.json`/`site/options.html` are honestly `STALE_SOURCE`
  against the real store's wall-clock age (§4 input #1, ">36h after close"); the OK
  scenes in `verify_shots/` are rendered from a SEPARATE, uncommitted
  `--ignore-staleness` build (never written to `site/`) purely so the OK/quiet
  scenes have real data to render against. This is the same diagnostic convention
  the contract's `--ignore-staleness` flag already documents ("local verification of
  the scoring math against a deliberately frozen test store") — never used by the
  nightly lane, never reflected in the committed STALE_SOURCE artifact's own
  `board_state`.
