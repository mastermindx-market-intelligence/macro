"""Subsector-rotation alert engine — fires when a subsector ROTATES.

A sibling of engine.theme_alerts / engine.emergence_alerts. The rotation read
(engine.subsector_rotation) is a per-run model output with no stored series, so
this is CHANGE-DETECTION across runs: it diffs each subsector's rotation *state*
(is it in the accelerating "emerging" set; is it a leader that just rolled over)
against the prior snapshot in data/subsector_rotation/state.json and emits one
event when a subsector crosses a boundary —

  rotation_turn_up    a subsector's CYCLE turn up is confirmed across sessions — it fell,
                      then turned, and held (engine.subsector_turn). Severity carries a
                      size + breadth term, so a one-name move cannot print `high`.
  rotation_turn_down  the mirror: it ran, then rolled over, confirmed.
  rotation_emerging   a subsector newly enters the Improving/Leading quadrant
                      with positive acceleration (a rotate-IN early signal).
  rotation_fading     a former leader newly flips to Weakening (rotate-OUT).

Event schema matches the other engines (id, ts, source='rotation', asset, type,
severity, headline/detail + _zh, context, anchor) so engine.alert_triage picks
it up with zero new plumbing. FIRST run (no prior state) SEEDS silently — never
an alert storm. CONTEXT-ONLY: a rotation read carries no validated forward edge;
it rides Finviz's broad-universe numbers (names we hold no prices for).

THREE CLOCKS (2026-08-20 repair — see engine/alert_time.py)
----------------------------------------------------------
The rotation payload distinguishes ``asof`` (the settled session the read is about)
from ``generated_utc`` (the moment our builder ran).  This engine used to stamp its
events with ``generated_utc or asof``, so a conclusion drawn from the Aug-19 close
surfaced on the Alert Command Center as "2026-08-20 · today" — build time wearing
event time's clothes, on a board whose whole job is to rank by what is live NOW.
Every event therefore carries all three clocks explicitly:

  ``event_date``   the session the rotation was observed from  (= ``asof``)
  ``source_asof``  the observation it was derived from          (= ``asof``)
  ``recorded_at``  when we serialized it                        (= ``generated_utc``)
  ``ts``           the LEGACY field, kept for the append-only store's ordering and
                   for readers predating this schema.  It is the EVENT date when we
                   know it; when ``asof`` is missing it falls back to the record
                   clock and ``date_precision`` is ``"unknown"``, which forbids any
                   consumer from reading it as an event time.  It is never silently
                   the build clock again.

The ``id`` bucket deliberately stays on the RECORDED day.  Dedup safety: the store is
append-only and merges by id (``rebuild``), and every historical row was minted with a
recorded-day bucket.  Re-bucketing on ``asof`` would let a future event's id collide
with an existing row (an Aug-20 session recorded Aug-21 would mint the same id as the
Aug-19 session recorded Aug-20), and ``by_id.setdefault`` would silently DROP the new
event.  Keeping the recorded bucket leaves every historical id byte-identical and every
future id collision-free, so this repair rewrites no history and drops no event.
