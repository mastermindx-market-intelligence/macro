"""China Prophet V3 auto-tripwire specifications (G0.8 scaffolding).

CONTRACT
    This module is DATA, not a grader.  It declares the four comparisons the
    ratified V3/V4 slate must be watched on, each with its cohort definition, its
    threshold, and the action a breach triggers.  The nightly CN loser+miss
    telemetry engine (masterplan §5 W0, ``engine/cn_prophet_audit.py``) is the
    consumer: it computes each comparison from the accrued forward ledger, writes
    the outcome into ``data/cn_prophet_audit/latest.json``, and — on a breach —
    emits a line-start ``::warning`` plus the named revert proposal.

    Nothing here reads a file, imports a dependency, or holds state.  It is
    deliberately dependency-free so the telemetry engine, a test, or an ad-hoc
    research script can all import it without dragging in pandas.

WHY IT EXISTS
    G0.8 (masterplan §0, added 2026-08-04) requires every operator-ratified direct
    wiring to ship with (a) parallel shadow grading of the displaced definition,
    (b) a NAMED auto-tripwire with its threshold and revert action, and (c) a clean
    single-commit revert path.  ``china_board_rank.v2_shadow_featured`` is (a) for
    the v3 admission change; ``china_board_rank.v3_shadow_featured`` is (a) for
    the v4 ordering change; this module is (b); each race keeps its own one-field
    revert path as (c).

    R1-R3 are the v3 admission/theme/relay studies, carried forward into the v4
    era.  V4 preserved every v3 admission rule and changed only the ORDER, so
    those three comparisons stay meaningful against the live shelf.  R4 is the
    v4-vs-v3 ordering race.  No forward v4 ordering edge is currently claimed.

READING THE SPECS
    ``direction`` states which side the tripwire expects to be BETTER.  A breach is
    the measured comparison going the other way by at least ``threshold`` once
    ``min_matured`` episodes have matured — never before.  ``min_matured`` is a
    floor on the SMALLER cohort: a 60-episode v3 shelf raced against 4 shadow rows
    is not a race, and reporting it as one would be the more dangerous failure.
    None of these thresholds is a promise; they are alarms that route a decision to
    the operator, and only the operator's read reverts a ratified wiring.

#: The definition the LIVE board stamps today.  Every R1-R3 cohort below is drawn
#: from the live shelf, so this must move with ``china_board_rank.BOARD_DEFINITION``

#: rows, and a tripwire that matches nothing reads as "no breach" while it is
#: actually blind.  It is a literal rather than an import so this module stays
#: dependency-free; ``tests/test_china_board_rank_v4.py`` pins the two equal, so a
#: future bump fails CI here instead of silently disarming the alarms.

#: V4 preserved every v3 admission rule (R1 prime window, R2 theme_timing, R3
#: relay_late) and changed only the ORDER, so R1-R3 stay meaningful against the live
#: shelf.  Their accrual clocks restart at the v3→v4 boundary rather than pooling
#: across it: v4's shelf COMPOSITION differs (the caps now bind on intelligence
#: interest), and pooling two shelf compositions into one cohort would confound the
#: very comparison the tripwire exists to make.
