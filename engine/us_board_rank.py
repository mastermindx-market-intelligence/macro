"""US Prophet v1 — board priority score, stage buckets, featured flag, theme linkage.

Architecture mirrors :mod:`engine.china_board_rank` (``cn_prophet_v2``): frozen
constants, pure functions, an artifact-disclosed ``ranking`` block, and no pandas
dependency in the scoring path.  The score is a **transparent priority heuristic,
not a calibrated return forecast** — it orders names that the confluence admission
gate has already admitted; it never decides who is on the board.

Three US-specific departures from the CN module are deliberate and evidenced:

1. ``edge`` (25 pts) replaces CN's ``reversal_member`` leg and is the **residual-alpha
   percentile inside the current buy pool**.  ``research/US_BOARD_MEASUREMENT.md``
   measured residual alpha as the only positive-IC leg at every horizon (§3), while
   the *published* board order — which was conviction/``composite_z`` ordering — was
   anti-predictive at the top (P@1 0.20 as published vs 0.60 re-ordered by alpha;
   ``corr(board_position, excess_5d) = +0.07``; top-5 lift −13.7 points vs the board's
   own base rate, §1).  Its ruling is "order by edge, gate by timing, never the
   reverse".  Accordingly **conviction / composite_z carry ZERO score authority here**
   (see :data:`ZERO_SCORE_AUTHORITY`) and the percentile is transformed
   ``clip01((pctile − 0.25) / 0.75)`` so the bottom quartile of alpha earns nothing.
2. ``runway`` (10 pts) reads the own-history extension z (``ext_z``) rather than CN's
   fuel/extension blend, because that is the extension evidence the US builder
   attaches to a board row.  **This leg read 0 on every row of the 07-31 board, and
   that was a BUILDER WIRING defect, not a property of the leg.**
   ``build_stock_library`` fed :func:`engine.extension.extension_signals` one close
   panel holding both 5-sessions-a-week equities and 24/7 crypto; that panel is indexed
   on the union of the two calendars, and ``extension_signals`` then read a single global
   ``.iloc[-1]``.  So on any build whose newest date was not an equity session — every
   weekend, every market holiday — the last row was crypto-only, every equity's
   ``ext_z`` came back NaN, and no board row carried the leg's input.  Splitting that
   panel by calendar restores it (68/71 of the same buy lane score non-zero, and the
   attainable range returns to 0–100 from the 0–90 the dead leg imposed).  *The 0–100
   range survives ANTICIPATION v1 unchanged: the flat entry leg pays
   :data:`ENTRY_NEUTRAL_VALUE` = 1.0, which is deliberate — see the WHY block on that
   constant.  Flat is not dead: the leg still scores non-zero on every admissible row
   and still separates admissible from non-admissible, it simply declines to order
   within.*

   Do not re-freeze a number here.  Every ``ranking`` block carries
   :func:`component_coverage`, computed from the rows actually scored, so the LIVE
   receipt — not this docstring — is what tells a reader whether the leg is carrying
   information on a given board.  No formula change was made in either era: a null is a
   fact to disclose, not a reason to re-tune (house epistemics — the gauntlet gates
   PROMOTION, not building).
3. Timing decides **grouping** (the stage bucket), never the within-bucket order —
   the same measurement found the timing leg net-negative to sort by (§3, Study 2).

Nothing outside :data:`SCORE_WEIGHTS` may add points.  Theme membership, sector turn,
narrative, the legacy setup score, fundamental quality, low volatility, risk sizing,
smart money, insider prints, SUE, and options/GEX are **context chips only**.

Fail-closed rule, inherited from CN: unknown evidence never earns best-case points.
A row with no extension reading scores 0 on ``runway`` (it is not assumed "not
extended"), and a row with an unknown entry status buckets to ``setting_up``, never to
``live``.

FAIL-CLOSED IS ABOUT POINTS, NOT ABOUT THE LANE (ANTICIPATION v1, 2026-08-08).  From
2026-08-06 an unknown ``ext_z`` also VETOED ``featured``, and on 2026-08-06 that turned
one upstream data gap into a dark board: the equity close panel's newest row carried 6
of 3,034 members, the pre-#4979 positional reader selected that sparse row, all 69 buy
rows came back ``ext_z`` None, and the featured lane published 0 of 69.  #4979 now
coverage-anchors the read and withholds it past a bounded age, preventing that exact
sparse-row failure.  Unknowns remain possible when a name lacks enough own history or
the bounded panel read is withheld, so the lane policy still matters.  A veto that
converts an input outage into "we have nothing for you" is a bigger error than the one
it was written to prevent.  An unknown reading is now DISCLOSED rather than vetoing:
the row is featured-eligible and carries ``ext_unknown: true``, the artifact prints the
unknown count, and a majority-unknown board raises a ``::warning``.  A KNOWN reading
past the parabolic line still blocks, exactly as before — the veto still fires on
evidence, it just no longer fires on absence.

# v2 (RATIFIED 2026-08-10): ADMISSION changed — the counter-trend 200-day RECLAIM leg is
# now WAIVED for a US name whose basket peers are themselves washed out at the ratified
# notch (`engine.signal_quality.RECLAIM_WAIVED`; the HOLD leg is untouched and every
# other leg is byte-identical).  Authority: `research/RECLAIM_VETO_CONDITIONAL_PREREG.md`
# §4 Arm P, adjudicated + ratified §5, notch moved to 20% family-wide by the operator the
# same day; the fence itself was pre-specified by
# `research/prophet_us_audit/RECLAIM_VETO_PACKET_2026-08-05.md` §7, which is why this
# constant — not a new one — is the thing that moves.
#
# An admission change makes v1 and v2 two different products: the v1 board could not admit
# a washed-out counter-trend name at all, so pooling their forward records would read as
# one track record of a rule that never existed.  The stamp is the fence — it rides into
# `us_standouts.json` (`rank_by` / `board_definition`, stamped from HERE by
# scripts/build_stock_library.py), into the US board ledger through `grade_us_board`'s
# `rank_by`, into the research spine through `us_context_vector`'s
# `(stamp_date, ticker, board_definition)` dedupe key, and into every `ranking` block
# emitted below.  Same move, same reason, as `hk_prophet_v2` (#4470).
BOARD_DEFINITION = "us_prophet_v3"

#: The RANKING AUTHORITY, as of the Chairman override of 2026-08-15.
#:
#: ``us_prophet_v3`` is the same board as ``us_prophet_v2`` in every respect that
#: decides WHO is on it — selection population, raw signal gate, admissible entry
#: statuses, stage logic, execution safeguards, featured shortfalls, earnings and
#: extension checks, caps.  What changed is WHICH INTERESTING NAME RISES: the five-leg
#: weighted heuristic below is retired from the rank path and the deterministic C1
#: evidence-family fusion (:mod:`engine.us_prophet_fusion`) orders the pool inside each
#: stage bucket.
#:
#: WHY THE STAMP MOVED EVEN THOUGH THE POPULATION DID NOT.  ``BOARD_DEFINITION`` is the
#: FORWARD-LEDGER fence: it keys the candidates store, the grade store and the context
#: spine, and its job is to stop two different products' records from pooling.  A board
#: ordered by a different ranker publishes a different top-30 from the same evidence, so
#: pooling v2's forward record with v3's would read as one track record of a ranker that
#: never ran.  That is the same reason v1 -> v2 bumped, and it is a different question
#: from :data:`SELECTION_ERA`, which does NOT move here — see its own note.
BOARD_DEFINITION_ADOPTED = "2026-08-15"

#: The retired scorer, kept RUNNING with zero authority.  Every US row carries a
#: ``prophet_shadow`` block computed by :func:`legacy_v2_values` — byte-identical
#: arithmetic to the pre-override ``prophet`` block — so the champion it replaced keeps
#: producing a forward-gradeable order beside the canonical one instead of vanishing on
#: the day it was superseded.  It originates no plan, controls no Featured slot, sets no
#: priority and moves no user-visible order (``tests/test_us_prophet_fusion_board.py``
#: pins each of those).
SHADOW_DEFINITION = "us_prophet_v2_shadow"

#: The DEGRADATION stamp.  If the fusion plane cannot be built on a given night — no
#: family survives the presence/variance floors, or the pass raises — the board does NOT
#: quietly fall back inside the canonical stamp.  It publishes under this name with a
#: ``prophet.degradation`` receipt naming the cause, so a night ranked by the retired
#: heuristic can never be mistaken for a night ranked by fusion, in the artifact or in
#: any forward ledger keyed off the definition.
FALLBACK_DEFINITION = "us_prophet_v2_fallback"

#: Era stamps this board USED to publish under, newest last.  A `BOARD_DEFINITION` bump
#: appends the displaced stamp here in the SAME PR: these are HISTORICAL FACTS about rows
#: already written to `data/us_board_ledger/` and the context-vector spine, and nothing in
#: `engine/` names them any more, so there is no producer left to read them from.  The CN
#: sibling (`scripts/build_china_library._CN_SUPERSEDED_ERA_STAMPS`) carries the scar that
#: motivates this: #4509 bumped the stamp without appending, and 72 rows of the displaced
#: era fell out of every cohort.  A consumer that partitions a ledger by era reads
#: `{BOARD_DEFINITION} | set(SUPERSEDED_ERA_STAMPS)` — never a hand-copied literal.

#

# and HK has never had an ``ext_z`` wiring — nothing sets it in
# ``scripts/build_hk_library.py`` or ``engine/hk_board_rank.py``, and no row of any
# committed HK artifact carries one.  Unscoped, the alarm therefore fired on HK at
# 100% every single night, with remediation text naming a US equity close panel HK does
# not build.  A warning that is always on is not a warning; it teaches readers to skip
# the annotation that matters on the night the US panel really does go dark.
#
# HK's gap is not thereby hidden — it is DISCLOSED, which is the honest form for a
# permanent known absence rather than an outage: ``ext_unknown`` on every row,
# ``ext_unknown_coverage`` on the ranking block, and the featured copy on the board
# saying so (``tests/test_hk_board_ui.py`` pins all three).  Add a market to this set
# when it WIRES an extension reading, never merely because it renders a board.
#

#
# WHAT BUMPS IT, AND WHY THE ANSWER IS NOT "ANY EDIT" (orchestrator ruling 2026-08-09).
# An earlier draft said to bump this "whenever the ladder or the featured set moves".
# That made the revision rule below UNSATISFIABLE, and the trap is worth naming because
# it is easy to re-introduce: the rule asks for n >= 50 graded marks per cell at H=63
# on episodes stamped with THIS era, and H=63 needs ~3 months to mature — so if the era
# resets every time the map is touched, the episode pool resets with it and the count
# can never reach 50.  A pre-registration whose own clock is restarted by the act of
# revising is not a gate, it is a permanent no.
#
# So: this names WHAT THE BOARD IS SELECTING FOR — the population and the admission
# gate that decide which names become episodes — and it survives a revision of how
# those names are VALUED or ORDERED.  Re-valuing the entry ladder, or widening the
# featured entry set (both of which this era did), leaves the episodes comparable and
# the stamp unchanged.  Bump it only when the selected population itself changes:
# a new admission gate, a different universe, a different lane definition.
#
# THE 2026-08-15 FUSION OVERRIDE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT MOVE THIS.  Replacing the rank
# authority with C1 evidence-family fusion is the largest ORDERING change this board has
# made, and it is exactly the class of change the paragraph above says leaves the stamp
# alone: the buy pool is decided by the confluence admission gate, and that gate, its
# universe and its lanes are untouched.  Bumping the era here would restart the H=63
# episode clock for the second time in a week and re-create the unsatisfiable-gate trap
# the ruling above exists to prevent.  The ranker change is fenced by
# `BOARD_DEFINITION` instead, which is the fence built for it.

#
# ANTICIPATION v1 (2026-08-08) — THE ADMISSIBLE STATUSES ARE FLAT, ON PURPOSE.
#
# How this landed here.  A2 was first written PATIENCE-FIRST, adopting CN v3's ladder
# outright (``bounce_wait 1.0 … buy_soon 0.35``, ``engine/china_board_rank.py:96-112``)
# on the strength of the parity anatomy — CN's live board is 24/24 patience statuses
# where the US admitted set was 27/27 action statuses, and the US board already carries
# the bounce_wait cohort.  That ordering never reached main.  The §6.6 US
# re-measurement's first run came back ADVERSE to it, on the US board's own graded
# episodes.
#
# THE NUMBERS ARE QUOTED IN FULL BELOW, ON PURPOSE.  The write-up lands in a SEPARATE
# PR (``research/prophet_us_audit/US_STATUS_REMEASUREMENT_2026-08-08.md``, #4988, which
# merges BEFORE this one), so on this branch that path does not resolve.  A map whose
# only stated reason is a pointer to a file the reader cannot open is an unevidenced
# map; these five lines are the load-bearing result, and they are here so this change
# can be judged on its own:
#
#   * buy lane, H=5, both cells above the 20-mark floor: ``bounce_wait`` 54.9% loser
#     (n=153, median excess −0.96%) vs ``buy_now`` 39.0% (n=95, +1.05%).  That is CN's
#     ordering read backwards, by 15.9 points of loser rate.
#   * H=10 keeps the direction: ``bounce_wait`` 65.4% (n=52).
#   * the watch lane repeats it on an independently selected population:
#     ``bounce_wait`` 55.3% (n=76) / 55.9% (n=34).
#   * AND THE NULL THAT OUTWEIGHS ALL OF IT: ``bounce_wait`` has ZERO graded marks at
#     H=21 in any lane, out of 345 episodes, and H=63 has never matured for any status.
#     The patience thesis's claim is "these names need time"; the horizons that would
#     test it carry no US observations at all (the W7 horizon map charters basing at
#     H=63).
#   * WINDOW CONFOUND (found 2026-08-09 by the per-cell vintage fields #4988 added):
#     the buy-lane ``bounce_wait`` cohort spans only 8 board dates, all from
#     2026-07-17 on, while ``buy_now`` spans all 18 dates from 2026-06-18 — different
#     tape, not just different maturity.  The Wilson intervals stay disjoint
#     ([0.470, 0.626] vs [0.298, 0.490]) so the gap survives on its own terms, but the
#     headline is weaker evidence than its point estimates read.  An ordering the
#     record cannot cleanly test is a STRONGER case for the flat leg, not a weaker one.
#
# CROSS-MARKET BOUNDARY (#4972/#4988).  The quoted CN rates are an ordinary
# split-adjusted forward-return comparator over Prophet standout-board admissions.  They
# are context only: not exact legal-band evidence, and they transfer no status value,
# ordering, rank, candidate, gate, Prophet, Neural Web, or trade authority to this map.
# Exact CN legal-limit verdicts require authorized unadjusted TuShare ``daily`` joined to
# same-key ``stk_limit`` with integer-cent equality.  The flat US ruling above rests on
# the US record's inability to license either ordering; it does not import the CN rates.
#
# So the short ruler refutes the CN ordering in this window, and the RIGHT ruler is
# unmeasured.  Neither patience-first nor chase-first is defensible as a ranking claim
# today, and the map must not encode a claim the evidence cannot carry in EITHER
# direction.  The five admissible statuses therefore share ONE value: the entry leg
# still separates admissible from non-admissible, and says nothing whatever about the
# order among them.  A flat leg cannot mis-rank.
#
# THE PRE-REGISTERED REVISION RULE (§6.6's chartered form).  A status ORDERING may be
# re-introduced among these five only when all three hold:
#   1. measured at the status's CHARTERED HORIZON (H=21/H=63 for the patience statuses,
#      not the 5-session ruler that is mostly reading the tape);
#   2. n >= 50 graded marks per cell;
#   3. sign-stable across two half-splits of the window, on episodes drawn from ONE
#      selection regime — ``selection_era: anticipation-v1-2026-08-08`` — so the split
#      is a split of time and not of two different boards.
# Anything less re-opens the same argument with the same absent data.
#
# THE ERA IS THE REGIME, NOT THE MAP VERSION, and clause 3 depends on that: see the WHY
# block on :data:`SELECTION_ERA`.  A revision that passes this rule changes these VALUES
# and does NOT bump the era, so the episodes it was measured on stay in the pool and the
# next revision can be measured against a longer window rather than a reset one.  Read
# the other way round — era bumped on every map edit — clause 2 could never be reached
# at H=63 and this rule would be a permanent refusal wearing a gate's clothes.
# ``tests/test_us_board_rank.py::TestEntryLeg`` pins the flatness, so a re-introduced
# ordering has to go through this rule rather than through an edit.
#
# WHY THE FLAT VALUE IS 1.0 (operator ruling 2026-08-08).  Flat is flat at any value —
# neutrality is a property of the five being EQUAL, not of what they equal — so the
# level is chosen for what it does to everything downstream of the score, not for what
# it claims.  It was briefly 0.75 on the reasoning that the top of the leg should be
# left unclaimed; that reasoning is about the leg in isolation and loses to two effects
# outside it:
#
#   (a) CROSS-ERA SCORE COMPARABILITY.  0.75 subtracts a flat 6.25 points from every
#       ``buy_now`` row and 3.75 from every ``partial`` row versus the pre-era map.
#       Era-stamped or not, a track record whose scores all step down overnight reads
#       as a change in the names when nothing about them moved — the drop carries no
#       information, only noise.  At 1.0 the attainable range stays 0–100.
#   (b) HIDDEN FIXED THRESHOLDS.  Any consumer holding an ABSOLUTE score floor — a
#       featured requirement, a caution-mode conviction floor, a downstream chip
#       cutoff — would have seen the confirmation class silently deflated under it.
#       A leg-level constant must not move rows across thresholds it cannot see.
#
# Measured effect at 1.0, against the pre-era trend-tape map (25-point leg):
#   buy_now 1.0 -> 1.0 = ZERO delta (byte-identical score) · partial 0.9 -> 1.0 = +2.5
#   · hold 0.65 -> 1.0 = +8.75 · wait_pullback 0.55 -> 1.0 = +11.25 · bounce_wait
#   0.35 -> 1.0 = +16.25.
# So no admissible row's score FALLS: the confirmation class holds station and only the
# previously-underranked patience rows lift to meet it.  AND NOTHING DEFLATES EITHER —
# not one status, admissible or not.
#
# NO REFUSED-CLASS VALUE MOVES (orchestrator ruling 2026-08-09).  A draft of this
# change also cut ``buy_soon`` 0.8 -> 0.35, on the ground that CN's table puts it at
# the bottom.  That was withdrawn, for the reason this whole module argues: CN's status
# VALUES are CN-measured and the §6.6 US re-measurement refuted their transfer at H=5
# and H=10.  A US demotion cannot borrow authority from the one ledger that refused it.
# ``buy_soon`` is also not among the five statuses §6.6 ranges over, so it falls under
# that ruling's "refused-class values unchanged" clause and keeps its trend-tape 0.8.
# Moving it would need its own US measurement, through the revision rule above.
#
# The non-admissible values are therefore ALL unchanged from the trend-tape era and are
# NOT part of this ruling: ``buy_soon`` 0.8, ``later`` 0.55, ``await``/
# ``await_confluence`` 0.45, ``watch`` 0.4, and the zeros.  ``extended`` stays 0.0

# ran its stage veto FIRST and refused anything not ``live``, while ``stage_for`` routes
# bounce_wait/wait_pullback to ``setting_up`` and hold to ``ran``.  So all three added
# statuses cleared the entry veto and were then stopped by the stage gate, and no
# featured flag on any board moved.  #4976 left it that way deliberately and pinned the
# inertness with a test, because relaxing the gate puts rows on a shelf whose own label
# reads "Setting up" / "Ran — don't chase" — a surface question, not a rank-module one.

# THE STAGE VETO, AFTER R2 — WHICH BUCKETS MAY REACH THE FEATURED SHELF.
#
# R2's ordering ruling (§6.9): status class is the FIRST gate and the stage veto only
# prunes names the status class has already admitted.  That is an ordering change, not
# an abdication — the stage bucket stays a veto, it simply stops being the reason a row
# is refused when its entry status was never admissible in the first place.
#
# WHY THIS SET IS {live, setting_up} AND NOT CN'S "NO STAGE GATE AT ALL".
# CN's ``_featured_shortfalls`` has no stage veto, and the parity anatomy named that as
# the structural difference.  Adopting it wholesale would feature ``ran`` rows, and
# ``ran``'s own rendered label is "Ran — don't chase" (:data:`STAGE_LABELS`).  A shelf
# that promotes a row while the row's own bucket label tells the reader not to chase it
# is a contradiction the board would be publishing about itself, so ``ran`` stays
# vetoed.  ``basing`` and ``blocked`` stay vetoed for the older reason: both are
# stand-aside evidence, and ``blocked``'s DOWNTREND clause is unconditional by design
# (see :func:`stage_for`) — a falling name does not reach a featured shelf because its
# entry status happened to read ``bounce_wait``.
#
# What this actually opens: ``bounce_wait`` and ``wait_pullback`` (both ``setting_up``)
# become featurable.  ``hold`` routes to ``ran`` and stays refused — so 2 of the 3
# statuses #4976 added are now live, and the third is still gated.  #4976's Proof 3
# measured the honest size of the prize on the 08-07 board: of 36 patience rows, 2

    ``bottom_watch_stage`` names the bucket the ladder's BOTTOM WATCH state routes to.
    The default is ``STAGE_BLOCKED`` — the behaviour every caller had before the basing
    shelf existed — so a board that has not built the shelf keeps its rendering
    byte-identical; the US board opts in by passing ``STAGE_BASING`` (see
    :func:`score_rows`).  It is a PARAMETER rather than a flag day because the shelf is
    a rendered surface: routing rows to a bucket a template does not know about would
    drop them below the blocked shelf via the catch-all, which is strictly worse than
    where they sit today.  DISPLAY-TIER ONLY — this function decides grouping, never
    membership, never score, never who is featured.

    WHY BOTTOM WATCH NEEDED ITS OWN BUCKET (D18, missed-ignitions audit).  BOTTOM WATCH
    is ``dir == "down"``, so the DOWNTREND clause below swallowed it: the one ladder
    state that names a name working on a low was invisible-by-construction, filed under
    "stand aside" beside the falling knives.  Measured on the board's own ledger
    (``data/us_board_ledger/snapshots.jsonl``, 2026-06-30..07-31): 41 buy-lane rows
    across 13 of 17 board days, every one of them routed to ``blocked``.  That clause
    was an unmeasured implementation choice, not a pre-registered rule (census verdict),
    and the split changes only which shelf a row renders under.

    Blocked wins over everything.  Masterplan §3.1 defines the bucket as
    ``{blocked, exit, avoid} OR label DOWNTREND``, and the DOWNTREND clause is
    UNCONDITIONAL: a name the cycle read calls a downtrend is blocked whatever its
    entry status claims.  The two clauses are independent evidence, and the entry
    status does not get to overrule the trend — a ``bounce_wait`` on a falling name is
    exactly the "catch the knife" row the stage buckets exist to demote.  (This engine
    previously applied the DOWNTREND clause only to rows with NO entry status at all,
    which silently let a downtrending ``bounce_wait`` render in ``setting_up``, above
    the blocked bucket.  ``tests/test_us_board_priority_ui.py::_stage_of`` — the
    rendered-HTML contract — has asserted the unconditional rule all along, so the

      outside ``templates/stocktable.js``'s ``FRESH_DAYS = 2`` — the fresh-only filter was
      dropping the freshest turns on the board.  ``fresh_bars`` itself is UNCHANGED: it
      gates eligibility and FRESH_TICKS across five boards, and re-anchoring it is a
      semantic change owing a blast-radius report (``research/
      SQ_BUCKET_LABEL_AS_DATE_FINDINGS_2026-08-07.md`` §4).
    * ``calendar`` — the plain date difference, used only when no marker-anchored
      session count exists.

    The two are NOT interchangeable and the gap is not small.  The calendar leg
    measures the distance from ``signal.asof``, which is the ticker's LAST CLOSE BAR
    (``engine.signal_quality.analyze`` stamps ``str(idx[-1].date())``), not the date
    the signal fired: on the committed 07-31 board NUE reads ``signal.asof
    2026-07-31`` while its own last marker fired ``2026-06-16``.  Calendar-only would
    therefore report that 45-day-old signal as 0 days and light the NEW dot on nearly
    every row.  ``fresh_bars`` measures the marker, which is what the field's name and
    its consumer both mean.

    Emitting the basis rather than silently switching units is the point: the same
    field carries calendar days on the CN/CA boards (days since first board
    appearance), so a consumer reading across boards must be able to see which
    question this number answers.  Returns ``(None, None)`` when neither is available —
    an unknown age is a null to print, never a zero.

    every later mutation.  Membership is untouched: this function adds fields and
    decides ORDER, never who is on the board.

    Sort key: ``(stage_rank, −score, ticker)``.  ``score_rank`` is the pool rank by
    that key and ``display_rank`` the rendered position; today they are equal, and
    they are kept separate so a future lane split cannot silently conflate them.

    ``definition`` stamps ``prophet.version`` (``hk_prophet_v1`` reuses this whole
    pass), ``alpha_of`` names the selection axis the ``edge`` leg reads, and
    ``featured_extra`` adds market-specific featured vetoes.  All three default to
    the US answer — the arithmetic, the weights and the stage map are SHARED, and
    only the field names are market parameters.

    ``bottom_watch_stage`` is the one exception to that "US answer by default" rule
    and it is deliberate: it defaults to ``STAGE_BLOCKED``, the pre-basing behaviour,
    so a board whose template has no basing shelf keeps rendering byte-identically.
    The US builder passes ``STAGE_BASING``; see :func:`stage_for`.  It moves rows

    ``corr(alpha, composite.legs.momentum) = 0.984`` — that leg is fed by
    ``alpha_pt[t]["alpha"]`` (scripts/build_stock_library.py, composite assembly), so

    The R2 reversal-cohort channel (§6.9): which board names sit inside a basket the
    ``us_basket_turn`` organ currently reads as washed-out, basing or turning.

    WHY THIS SHIPS SCORELESS, AND WHAT WOULD HAVE TO BE RULED TO CHANGE THAT.
    §6.9's run order specifies this channel at CN's ``reversal_member`` weight — 10
    points of 100.  It is stamped, disclosed and rendered here, and it earns ZERO
    points, because paying it would require reversing four separately-pinned rulings
    that a rank module does not get to reverse on its own:

    * ``sum(SCORE_WEIGHTS.values()) == 100.0`` is pinned twice in
      ``tests/test_us_board_rank.py`` (the dict itself, and the attainable ceiling).
      A tenth leg either makes the published scale 110 — an unmeasured shift in every
      score the board has ever printed — or takes 10 points off a leg that was
      measured, which is the same problem wearing a different hat.
    * ``sector_turn`` and ``theme`` are already in :data:`ZERO_SCORE_AUTHORITY`, and
      the module docstring's rule is "theme membership, sector turn ... are context
      chips only".  Basket-turn membership is that category, not an exception to it.
    * The US board deliberately REPLACED CN's ``reversal_member`` leg with ``edge``
      (25 pts) on measured evidence — ``research/US_BOARD_MEASUREMENT.md`` found
      residual alpha the only positive-IC leg at every horizon.  Re-introducing the CN
      leg re-opens that measurement; it does not inherit CN's weight by analogy.
    * The source artifact declares its own powers, in two places that agree:
      ``site/basketdata/us_basket_turn.json`` carries ``authority.may_rank: false``
      (pinned by ``tests/test_us_basket_turn.py``), and ``config/synapse.yml`` declares
      the same node ``may_rank: false`` with ``weights: none``.  Scoring off it would
      make both declarations false.

    So the channel ships the way the evidence supports today: LIVE, disclosed, and
    carrying no authority.  Promoting it to points is an orchestrator ruling on the
    scale question plus a synapse amendment — not a constant edit.

    SCARCITY IS REPORTED, NOT SMOOTHED.  Three states are distinguished and never
    collapsed, because they mean different things to a reader:
    ``input: "absent"`` (neither file resolved — nothing was checked), ``input:
    "present"`` with an empty ``members`` (checked, nobody qualified), and a populated
    map.  A missing input never degrades into "no members" — that is the same class of
    error as the 2026-08-06 extension blackout, where an upstream gap rendered as a
    confident empty answer.

    the weekly leg only — see :func:`ran_admits` for why, and note that the lane's
    user-facing copy claims nothing stronger than "the move already started" either
    way, so the relaxed policy introduces no surface claim the rows cannot support.

    These are DISPLAY-TIER context rows.  They carry no ``entry_signal``, no
    conviction claim and no priority score — the honest read is "the move already
    started; wait for the next entry", which is why they cannot outrank a live row.

    FAIL-CLOSED AGE (B3, 2026-08-02).  The row's AGE is the thing that must never be
    invented.  The anchor is the §7 buy-marker date, falling back to the verdict's
    ``fresh_bars`` session count; the previous fallback was the raw ``ticks`` count,
    which made ``sessions_since == ticks`` — the age understated ~3x (measured: 29/40/23
    true sessions shown as 11/15/9) — and it anchored ``pct_since`` on the wrong bar
    with it.  A row with NEITHER a marker date NOR a usable ``fresh_bars`` is DROPPED,
    because any age it could show would be fabricated: measured on the 235-name local
    store, 25 of 55 ran admits (45%) carry a sell/cut as their last marker and so have
    no cross date at all.  Every emitted row therefore carries ``anchor`` ∈
    {``marker``, ``approx``} and an age that is either exact or absent — never wrong.

    A missing PRICE SERIES is a different question and does not drop the row.  The age
    lives in the verdict, not in this lane's closes, so such a row still states when
    the cross fired and prints ``pct_since: None`` — a disclosed null, per the house
    rule that nulls are printed rather than hidden.

    Order: theme-confirmed rows first (their theme only just turned, so the desync is
    the point), then the freshest cross, then the largest move since it fired.

    ``move_read(series, marker_date) -> {pct_since, measured_from} | None`` REPLACES
    the move — and only the move; the date, the age and the drop rules are untouched.
    It exists because ``cross_read``'s marker anchor is the one
    ``signal_quality._buy_filter`` forbids for a forward return: ``marker['date']`` is
    a 3B bucket's LEFT edge whose label reads two buckets forward, so it precedes the
    close at which the signal was knowable by ~8 sessions and sits at the trough that
    created it.  MEASURED on the HK ran lane, 2026-07-31: every one of the 12 displayed
    rows overstated, mean +8.09pp, worst 3690.HK at +29.2% against +10.9% from the
    confirmation close.  The hook rather than an unconditional change because the move
    is also the lane's third sort key — re-anchoring after the sort would order and
    truncate the lane by a number it no longer prints — and because the US board's
    identical exposure has not been measured yet, so it keeps the old read and the old
    row shape byte-for-byte until it has.  Passing it adds ``measured_from``; omitting
    it changes nothing.  ⚠ THE US BOARD STILL CARRIES THIS DEFECT.
