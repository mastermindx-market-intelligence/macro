"""Dark-pool positioning context — the plain-word read over the off-exchange desk,
plus a same-day-idempotent change-feed and the forward ledger that makes it gradeable.

WHAT CHANGED IN v2 (2026-08-05) AND WHY
---------------------------------------
v1 tagged each standout name `accumulation` / `distribution` / `unusual` and rendered
that as "leaning up" / "leaning down". Two independent problems killed it:

  1. HOUSE LAW FORBADE THE CONSTRUCTION. `research/DO_NOT_REBUILD.md` (PSS-AF1 row)
     and the PSS-AF1 charter:

         "FINRA short volume is not short interest, net selling, or institutional
          buying. Raw short ratio/off-exchange share remains forbidden as a
          standalone direction signal."

     v1 derived a direction from exactly raw off-exchange share + raw short ratio,
     standalone, and shipped it in the hero, the rail and every name card.

  2. MEASUREMENT GAVE IT NOTHING TO STAND ON. Walk-forward over the panel available
     at the time (47 dates; n=86 accumulation / 61 distribution):

         horizon   acc-minus-dist    t      p
         1d            +0.22%       0.33   0.74
         5d            -0.87%      -0.63   0.53
         10d           -0.10%      -0.05   0.96

     The sign flips between 1d and 5d and nothing is near significance. 47 dates
     cannot refute a signal — but they also never supported one, and the copy was
     asserting a direction anyway.

v2 keeps every fact and drops the claim. Names are grouped by the CONJUNCTION that was
actually observed — heavy hidden volume together with which way price went over the
same stretch — which is a description of settled data, and is not standalone (price is
required). The direction question is now *accrued* rather than assumed: every tagged
name is written to `data/darkpool/ledger/forward.jsonl` nightly so it can be graded
against outcomes later.

Front-facing language follows the operator's 2026-07-27 rule: projection windows and
"what we're watching" conditions, never verdict or refutation vocabulary.

EPISTEMICS (house law)
----------------------
Every tag is a deterministic threshold on already-observed data — no model, no LLM
origination, no score with authority. Display/context tier only (is_context_only=True,
display_only=True): it never gates, ranks, sizes, or escalates any surface, and the
word "validated" is never emitted. Roughly half of off-exchange volume is short-marked
by default, so the short tape is read as a CHANGE vs each name's own norm, never as a
raw level.

The change-feed (compact_state / diff_changes / build_changes) mirrors
`transmission_context` exactly: same-day rebuilds reuse the stored prev_state so the
day's accumulated diff is never wiped.
