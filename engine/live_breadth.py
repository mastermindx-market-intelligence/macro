"""Pure join/count core for the live intraday breadth scoreboard.

The poller (``scripts/live_breadth_poller.py``) does the I/O — one Polygon
full-market snapshot per cycle, plus a one-time read of the nightly-baked
per-name thresholds — and this module does the maths, as pure functions with no
network and no filesystem so the join/count logic is unit-testable without a
socket or a store.

The emitted payload MIRRORS the nightly ``breadth_scorecard()`` shape
(scripts/build_site.py) so the surface lane renders the live poll payload and the
baked nightly payload through ONE code path:

    {"asof": iso, "delay_min": int, "session": "rth"|"pre"|"post"|"closed",
     "basis": "poll",
     "tiers": [{key, label:{en,zh}, univ, n, adv, dec, unch, adv_pct,
                pa50, pa200, nh, nl, net_nh}, ...],
     "comp": {n, adv, dec, unch, adv_pct, pa50, pa200, net_nh},
     "meta": {...}}

Unit conventions match the nightly builder exactly:
  - pa50 / pa200 are 0-100 PERCENTAGES (not fractions).
  - adv / dec / unch / nh / nl are integer counts.
  - adv_pct is 100*adv/(adv+dec) over the tier's advancing+declining names
    (unchanged names excluded from that ratio, as the nightly `adv_pct` is).

Epistemics (masterplan §6): DISPLAY-TIER ONLY. This module NEVER writes a store,
never advances a ledger, and emits NO stance wording — the composite carries the
numbers only; "broad/thin/mixed" copy is the surface's job, never the poller's.
Members absent from the snapshot are EXCLUDED from denominators and counted in
``meta.missing`` — never silently treated as unchanged.
