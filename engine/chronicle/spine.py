"""engine.chronicle.spine — event assembly + events.jsonl IO (W0).

Design note (byte-stable regeneration, masterplan §0 gates 1+2): every W0
source EXCEPT the two Chronicle-owned forward ledgers is already a full
snapshot or a full append-only ledger (catalog.json is the current full vault
snapshot; the prophet ledger, release forward ledger and risk_radar forward
log are full append-only ledgers; the earnings parquet is a full current
snapshot; and earnings_call_events.jsonl is the last-good committed projection
of the mutable R2 score generation). So ``build_events`` always fully
recomputes the event set from {catalog, prophet ledger, forward ledger,
risk_radar forward log, earnings parquet, CURRENT earnings-call rows, CURRENT
state_log rows} on
every run — incremental and --rebuild alike. Because event ids are stable
hashes of (source, source_ref, date), unchanged sources yield an identical id
set every time, which is exactly what makes gate 1 (byte-stable rebuild) and
gate 2 (idempotent zero-duplicate re-runs) hold. The only thing that differs
between incremental and --rebuild is whether state_log.jsonl gets a new row
appended BEFORE this recompute (see governor.py) — state_log itself is the one
genuinely-incremental, non-regenerable ledger in the store.

Append-only law (B1 fix): a source row can legitimately leave its snapshot
between runs (the earnings parquet keeps only a rolling window of quarters;
the vault catalog drops items by id) — that must never silently delete the
event it produced. ``governor.build_and_write`` calls :func:`union_events` to
union this run's recompute with whatever was previously committed, so an
ordinary dropped source row RETAINS its event (flagged, never erased) rather
than vanishing with no signal.

An authoritative correction is different from ordinary source disappearance.
Prophet's raw outcome ledger remains append-only, while its correction and
quarantine receipts explicitly withdraw known-invalid record claims. Chronicle
is a derived *effective* store, so :func:`apply_authoritative_retractions` runs
after the ordinary union and excludes those claims without mutating any raw
Prophet evidence. This exception is receipt-backed and source-scoped; it is not
a general delete path.

# byte-for-byte. ADDING AN ADAPTER REQUIRES EXTENDING THIS TUPLE. Two consumers
# key off it: ``manifest.build_manifest`` stamps a per-file sha256 vintage from
# every entry, and gate 1 in tests/test_chronicle.py enforces byte identity only
# when EVERY entry still matches the vintage the manifest attests.
#
# data/neuralweb/world_state.json is deliberately ABSENT: only the incremental
# nightly's state_log capture reads it (state_log.capture_row), and --rebuild
# skips that append entirely (governor.py), so world_state can never move a
# rebuilt byte. Listing it would manufacture phantom vintage drift every night
