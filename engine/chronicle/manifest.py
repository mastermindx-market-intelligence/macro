"""engine.chronicle.manifest — sidecar envelope payload assembly (masterplan §0
gate 5). data/chronicle/manifest.json carries the standard envelope keys (via
engine.neuralweb.envelope.stamp — dict payloads only, since it cannot stamp a
JSONL stream) PLUS per-adapter event counts/gap notes and per-ledger row counts
+ sha256 hashes, so downstream consumers (admin inspector, mastermind lobe) can
read health without re-parsing every ledger. It also pins the SOURCE VINTAGE —
one sha256 per :data:`engine.chronicle.spine.REBUILD_SOURCES` entry as of this
build — which is what lets gate 1 distinguish a legitimately-advanced source from
a store that does not reproduce (see :func:`_source_fingerprints`). Envelope
stamping happens in governor.py (this module only builds the pre-stamp payload
dict).

    This is the vintage pin gate 1 reads. The research-vault catalog is committed
    HOURLY by its own lane, so a committed events.jsonl is only byte-reproducible
    against the exact source vintages it was built from; recording them lets the
    gate tell "the store is genuinely broken" from "a source legitimately
    advanced since the store was written" instead of conflating the two.

    Fingerprinting the WHOLE closure rather than the catalog alone is
    load-bearing. The first version of this pin recorded only
    ``research_vault_catalog``, which leaves five other inputs able to advance
    unseen — and daily.yml's collect_tail job (which commits earnings.parquet)
    runs in PARALLEL with the engine job that rebuilds the spine, so
    earnings.parquet in particular moves under the store by construction. With a
    catalog-only pin, that drift left the gate on its STRICT byte path against
    sources that had already moved: a spurious red on unrelated PRs, which is
    precisely the failure that drew four duplicate fixes on 2026-07-26.

    never raises — a manifest must always be writable.
