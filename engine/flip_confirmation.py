"""engine/flip_confirmation.py — T+1 sector-flip confirmation lens.

Policy-Shock Regime program §4 W1-C (PR #2008).

A violent one-day sector-leadership flip is detected when the daily return
spread between the defensive composite (equal-weight XLP/XLU/XLV) and the
offense composite (equal-weight SMH/XLK) exceeds |z| >= 2.5 against the
trailing 252-day history of the same spread.

The NIGHT AFTER a flip this module computes four T+1 attribution legs:
  spread_persistence  — sign of next-day spread (same direction? + magnitude)
  absorption_delta    — change in market_drivers absorption_pctile day-over-day
  leadership_continuity — did the winning composite also win T+1? (recorded field)
  breadth_follow_through — omitted honestly (no intraday breadth series available)

Verdict vocabulary v1.1 — 3-way taxonomy on z-scale follow-through
(descriptive only, never a recommendation):
  CONFIRMED — sign(t1_spread)==sign(event_spread) AND |t1_z| >= 0.5
  MIXED     — sign(t1_spread)==sign(event_spread) AND |t1_z| < 0.5
               (leadership continued but follow-through weak)
  FADED     — opposite sign (regardless of magnitude)

Ledger: data/flip_confirmation/events.jsonl — append-only, keep-first per
event date. NIGHTLY is the sole writer. LEDGER STARTS EMPTY AT SHIP DATE
(2026-07-09) — only events on or after SHIP_DATE are written here.
The 2024→ historical scan is in-memory only, embedded in the site artifact.

qledger family: flip_confirmation.v1 (Round-2 design, Amendment PS-A2)
  ONE claim per event, horizon_d=21 (chassis auto-grades at 5d and 21d via
  in_scope_horizons(21) = [5, 21] — no double-counting).

  Claims are ONLY registered for CONFIRMED and FADED verdicts.
  MIXED events abstain (weak follow-through makes no directional call).

  Priceable proxy pair (D4 — macro claims must name a machine-checkable
  observable):
    subject (scope_key): XLP  — defensive composite proxy
    bench:               XLK  — offense composite proxy
  proxy_note: the true composite is EW(XLP,XLU,XLV) − EW(SMH,XLK); the
    scorable proxy is XLP-vs-XLK (both priceable in the parquet store).

  Direction semantics (grade_claim: direction=+1 → subject outperforms bench):
    event_z > 0 (defensives won T+0) → predict XLP outperforms XLK → direction = +1
    event_z < 0 (offense won T+0)    → predict XLP underperforms XLK → direction = -1

  timestamp_quality: CRAWL_BOUNDED (the z-score fires when the bar closes;
    that closing price IS the event — no look-ahead, immediately gradeable)

Historical descriptive scan: detect_since() sweeps 2024→ and returns all
flip events with their T+1 verdicts for the UI base-rate table. This is
labeled DESCRIPTIVE and never constitutes a registered claim.

Amendment PS-A2 (2026-07-09): see research/POLICY_SHOCK_REGIME_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md §4 W1-C.
Round-2 (same day): claims re-registered as one 21d claim per CONFIRMED/FADED
  event on the priceable XLP-vs-XLK proxy pair; MIXED abstains.

    MIXED events abstain (no claim registered).

    The 2024→ descriptive scan is run once for the summary stats but events
    before SHIP_DATE are NEVER written to data/; they appear only in the site
    artifact (flip_confirmation_data.json `descriptive_scan` block).

    Called by scripts/build_flip_confirmation.py.
    Returns a summary dict for the build log.
