"""Entry-timing gauge (engine v2) — the SECOND, separate gauge.

The conviction score answers "is this a name worth OWNING?". This module answers
the orthogonal question the old engine conflated into it: "should I buy it NOW, and
if not, at what PRICE and WHEN?". It turns the cycle/ladder read into a structured,
actionable plan — a status, a buy zone (real prices), a don't-chase line, an
invalidation stop, a rough timing window, and an entry-favorability read by horizon —
so a high-conviction-but-extended leader (HWM, NVDA) reads "WAIT — accumulate ~$X on
the pullback", never "99 · Buy Now".

It is deliberately downstream of and consistent with engine.cycles: it READS the
already-calibrated ladder state + entry urgency + the drawdown-calibrated
`eq_score` + multi-timeframe `bottom_confidence`, and adds the price levels and the
horizon read the cards/Mastermind need. It never re-decides direction — the ladder
owns that. Display + decision context; the cycle-top veto lives in engine.cycles.
