"""engine/importance_v0.py — the novelty-first importance challenger (W3, spec D6 / §2.4).

LEAF · CONTEXT-ONLY · DETERMINISTIC · SHADOW-ONLY. Imports only the two qual leaf
primitives (engine.qbus, engine.qkernel); nothing in the mechanical scoring path
imports it, and this module NEVER renders. It is the *challenger* in a
champion-challenger duel against the hand importance formulas: the hand formula's
HIGH/LOW bands were shown to be indistinguishable from the placebo tape at 5d, so
a genuinely-novel scorer has to earn its place by beating both on the same
scoreboard (qledger) rather than by fiat.

`importance_v0(item, asof, df)` returns a deterministic float in [0, 1] built from
five *provisional* priors — this is a v0 prior, NOT a fit (D6: "Document each
weight as a provisional constant … a v0 prior, not a fit"). Learning (logistic /
GBM ≤8 features) begins only once the scoreboard holds ≥500 graded relevance
labels; until then the weights below are frozen hand-set constants and the whole
point of the shadow lane is to grade whether these priors carry any forward
signal at all.

The five features (D6 verbatim, plus the crowding penalty):
  (a) novelty_z   — qbus.novelty_z of the item's PRIMARY entity-or-theme at asof.
                    High novelty (attention unusually elevated for a normally-quiet
                    subject) pushes the score UP. This is the headline feature.
  (b) corroboration — qbus.echo_stats on the item's event_key: cross-DESK breadth
                    (many independent desks carried the SAME event) pushes UP, but
                    it is gated by novelty so that WITHIN-window echo of an OLD
                    story (a big cluster of near-duplicate items with LOW subject
                    novelty) pushes DOWN, not up. Corroboration is novelty ×
                    breadth, never raw item volume (D6: "novelty × corroboration,
                    not volume").
  (c) source_tier — qkernel.TIER_WEIGHT of the item's source_tier. A wire (tier 1)
                    outweighs an aggregator (tier 3); tier 0 (blocked / unlisted)
                    contributes nothing.
  (d) scheduled-surprise — EXCLUDED at v0. See _SURPRISE_EXCLUDED below: the only
                    is_surprise implementation in the tree
                    (china_news_intel.is_surprise) is a DATE-COLLISION test with no
                    topic gate, and qbus rows carry no scheduled_ref column, so the
                    feature is neither valid (per the task's opt-out rule) nor even
                    derivable from the bus. It is left out and its weight is folded
                    into the remaining features (documented, not hidden).
  (e) crowding    — attention-crowding PENALTY (D6: "attention is late and
                    crowded"). The trailing-7d item-volume z on the SAME subject
                    reduces the score: a subject that has already been loud for a
                    week is late, not novel, even if today's bar is high.

All features are PIT — `asof` is passed by the caller (no ambient clock), the
same discipline as qbus / qkernel. Every function returns plain data and NEVER
raises into a caller; a missing feature degrades to a neutral contribution rather
than a crash (the alt-data degraded-mode lesson: absent, not wrong).

# These are hand-set constants, frozen until the scoreboard holds ≥500 graded
# relevance labels (D6). They are exposed as a module constant so the duel report
# and the tests can assert on them, and so a future learned model reads them as
# its warm-start prior rather than re-deriving them. The four LIVE features
# (novelty, corroboration, source_tier, crowding-penalty) are convex-combined;
# the excluded scheduled-surprise weight is folded proportionally into the rest

         asof, matching the score_store behaviour (which also calls clean_df).
