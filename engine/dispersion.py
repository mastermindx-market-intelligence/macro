"""Cross-sectional DISPERSION & correlation regime — the meta-signal for WHEN stock
selection pays (engine v2, display + a gross dial).

Alpha and achievable information-ratio scale with cross-sectional dispersion (S&P DJI,
Gorman-Sapra-Weigand): when names move together (low dispersion / high pairwise
correlation, a macro-driven tape) stock selection earns little no matter how good the
signal; when they fan out (high dispersion, often high-VIX) selection — and our
reversal/timing legs — pay the most. So this is the dial that sizes SELECTION
conviction (the gross taken on the cross-sectional book), kept DISTINCT from the
market-timing overlay that sizes net/long exposure.

Kept to 2-3 DISCRETE states with fixed thresholds (a continuous fitted curve is the
classic overfit trap). Point-in-time; correlation is the standard EW-var / mean-name-var
approximation (a full pairwise matrix on ~1600 names is unestimable and overfit)."""
