"""engine.prophet_live.live_states — the */5 intraday state machine (P0 D3, pure).

Stdlib only: no pandas, no network, no filesystem. The evaluator script owns every
side effect (quote load, R2 get/put); this module owns the decisions, so the whole
state machine is drivable from a test with three dicts.

WHAT IT DECIDES. Given tonight's armed pack, a delayed quote view and the previous
pass's artifact, each name gets one PUBLIC state:

    dormant   no provisional close in the armed band is buyable
    near      inside the band, live price below the trigger (or one unconfirmed
              pass above it — see the debounce note)
    forming   the gate is satisfied at the live price
    faded     it was forming today and the price has fallen through the buffer
    at_risk   a name that IS on tonight's board has traded to where tonight's
              verdict would flip — down through its fade level, or up past the
              point the not-topped veto bites
    unknown   the tape is readable and the name is fine — the PACK never measured
              the gate at this price, so there is no verdict to report
    dark      nothing honest can be said (no quote, stale quote, irregular gate)

UNKNOWN IS NOT DARK, and the difference is a user-facing one (W-L0 gate 5). ``dark``
means the LANE failed for this name; the strip spends that count twice, in the footer
("N of them could not be read this pass") and in the rule that flips the whole panel to
"prices aren't updating" once half the names are dark. A name trading below the region
its pack swept is read perfectly — the quote is fresh, the name is fine, the PACK is
simply silent down there — so filing it under dark would make both of those disclosures
a confidently wrong cause on any broadly-red day. It gets its own state and its own
``meta.unknown_counts`` bucket instead. Like dark it publishes no level and no
``since_ts``: a non-verdict has nothing to time.

Names the pack never probed are not in ``states`` at all: the budget or the data
stopped us, the tape cannot settle it, and ~1.2k identical dark rows would say
nothing that ``meta.unprobed`` does not. The pack remains the per-name census.

plus the flag ``confirming_into_close`` from ``confirm_window_start`` ET onward
while conditions still hold — close-dependence shrinks as the session ends, so
that is the strongest honest moment the lane has.

DEBOUNCE (G0.5, CSP-R2 — a 1-tick state flip is a killed class), on BOTH paths.
A cross needs ``debounce_passes`` CONSECUTIVE passes inside the interval. One pass
is ``crossing_unconfirmed``: an INTERNAL marker, carried in ``internal`` and in the
event spool for measurement, never the public ``state``.

LEAVING the interval is debounced the same way and on BOTH EDGES (W-L0 gate 2). A
breach that clears the hysteresis buffer — under ``lo * (1 - fade_buffer_pct/100)``
or over ``hi * (1 + fade_buffer_pct/100)`` — is decisive and fades the name on the
pass it happens. A MARGINAL one pays ``debounce_passes`` consecutive failing passes
first, and until then the published ``forming`` holds with its cross counter intact.
The buffer used to be honoured only BELOW the trigger, so a name a tenth of a percent
over ``fade_hi_px`` published ``faded`` on ONE pass while a name the same distance
under the trigger held — the killed 1-tick flip, on the edge where "don't chase" is
the loudest thing the strip says. A holding pass clears the failing counter, and
fading resets the cross counter, so a re-cross pays the full two passes again.
A pass that stopped holding but was SUPPRESSED by the buffer carries
``fade_unconfirmed``, the fourth marker: every other debounced transition already had
one, and a suppressed pass nobody records is a suppression nobody can measure — which
is the whole charter of the marker set. Gate 2 widens it to both edges, so a marginal
OVERRUN is now as countable as a marginal drop.

The BOARD path is debounced the same way, symmetrically. It was not, and a board
name whose price straddled its fade level by four cents (90.02 / 89.98 on a 90.00
level) flipped forming↔at_risk on every pass — the exact killed class, on the path
where the name is already on a published board. Now a breach that does not clear
the buffer needs ``debounce_passes`` consecutive failing passes to publish
``at_risk``, and recovery needs the same going back; a move that clears the buffer
is decisive immediately in either direction.

SINCE (the P1 ``SINCE`` column, design spec §6.6). Every non-dark state carries
``since_ts``: the ISO-Z ``pass_ts`` of the pass that first put the name in the public
state it is in NOW, within this ET session. It is carried forward byte-identical
while the public state persists — banking a second debounce pass, gaining an
``internal`` marker or raising ``confirming_into_close`` are not public-state changes
— and re-stamped when the public state changes, ``near``→``forming`` included: what
the reader is being told changed, so the clock on it restarts. It is measured, never
derived: ``passes × 5 min`` is not a lawful substitute, because this cron lands
minutes late and an ``entered:"board"`` name's ``passes`` counts from the day's first
evaluation rather than from a cross, so the arithmetic prints a duration the lane
cannot stand behind. A new session resets it for free — ``prev_states`` resolves only
when the predecessor's ``meta.session_et`` is this pass's.

A DARK OR UNKNOWN row publishes NO ``since_ts``: there is no verdict to time, and
inventing one is exactly the guess G0.3 forbids. It instead carries its predecessor's
pair forward under ``prior_public``/``prior_since_ts`` (such a row re-carries such a
row's, so a gap of any length chains), so a name whose quote goes missing for a pass or
two — or which dips under the region its pack swept — and comes back to the SAME public
state keeps the time it actually entered that state
instead of restarting the clock. That is the per-name twin of ``dark_artifact``'s
whole-artifact ``carry``: a quote hiccup must not cost the session its history, and
without it a per-name dark would be more destructive than a whole-artifact one.
Coming back to a DIFFERENT public state re-stamps, which is the honest answer.

LEVELS (the P1 ``CROSS LEVEL`` column) — the other per-row display field, and the one
place this module republishes a number it did not decide. Every non-dark state carries
the pack's armed boundary for that name, under the key that says what the number MEANS
for THAT row, because the SAME lower edge is opposite news on the two kinds of row —
the trap :func:`engine.prophet_live.interval.lower_edge` documents:

    cross_level_px   the name is NOT on tonight's board (``entered:"cross"``): the
                     lowest provisional close that flips the gate true — the pack's
                     ``trigger_px``.
    fade_px          the name IS on tonight's board (``entered:"board"``): the SAME
                     lower edge, but here it is the level BELOW which tonight's
                     verdict flips false. Not a "cross" level for that row.
    fade_hi_px       the upper edge, either kind of row: above it the gate stops
                     admitting the name (the not-topped veto). This is what a name
                     with ``via:"overrun"`` ran past.

WHY ONLY THE CROSS KEY CARRIES ``_level_`` (operator ruling 2026-07-30). ``fade`` names
a LEVEL everywhere in this program — ``fade_px``/``fade_hi_px`` are the pack's own
numbers under the pack's own names — so those two need no marker and deliberately do
not get one. ``cross`` has no such property: it names an EVENT here, and a PRICE in the
nightly ledger, where ``cross_px`` is ``first_px``, what the tape actually printed at
the first cross (``scripts/reconcile_prophet_live``, load-bearing in that module's
``FIRST_WINS`` and in its ``close_vs_cross_pct``/``fill_vs_cross_pct`` derivations). So
the LEVEL takes the explicit infix and the ledger's field is left alone. Joining this
artifact to that ledger on a ``cross``-shaped name would compare a threshold against a
fill; the two names no longer collide, and this paragraph is why. ``transitions`` also
builds event rows field by field, so no level reaches the spool the ledger reads.

The two lower-edge keys are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE (the pack sets ``trigger_px`` xor
``fade_px``), so a consumer reads its column label off key PRESENCE and derives
nothing: ``cross_level_px`` ⇒ the cross level, ``fade_px`` ⇒ the fade level, neither ⇒
no level to print. A key is ABSENT rather than 0-or-null when there is no level: an
unprobed, withheld or irregular name, a name with no buyable region in the band, a
board name whose buyable region has no bound inside the band, and every ``dark`` row
(which, like ``since_ts``, has no public state to hang a level on).

NEVER RE-ROUNDED. The pack already rounds each edge INTO the buyable region at 4 dp
(lower up, upper down) and ships the full-precision bisected value instead when a
rounding step would cross the as-of close — so a published level is always a price the
gate genuinely accepted. Rounding again here could only move a level the wrong way and
print one the gate would reject, so the number travels exactly as armed. ``price`` is
still rounded for display: that is a quote, not a threshold.

ONE PRICE BASIS (W-L0 gate 3). The armed levels are prices on the nightly store's
SPLIT+DIVIDEND ADJUSTED close series; ``price`` on every row is a RAW vendor print off
the live plane. Both facts are stated on every payload under
``meta.price_adjustment`` (``levels`` and ``quote``) instead of being left for a
consumer to infer, and the live quote is deliberately NOT converted — an adjusted
"quote" is a number no exchange ever printed.

The two are only comparable while they describe the same scale, so every pass runs the
assertion :func:`engine.prophet_live.interval.basis_audit`: the pack's ``as_of_close``
against the feed's ``prev_close``, per name, for the same session. Past
``basis_tolerance_pct`` that name goes ``dark`` with reason ``basis_mismatch`` and
carries the measured ``basis_gap_pct`` — per NAME, because a distribution is a per-name
event and a whole-artifact dark would additionally cost every healthy name the debounce
it has banked today. ``meta.price_adjustment`` publishes ``checked_n``/``unchecked_n``
alongside, so a feed that quietly stops carrying previous closes reads as unchecked
rather than as clean. A row whose levels are on a basis OTHER than
``meta.price_adjustment.levels`` — the breadth-cache names, which accrue raw between
rebuilds — carries ``levels_adjustment``; absent means the artifact-level basis.

VOCABULARY IS LOAD-BEARING (G0.6 + operator 2026-07-27). Nothing here says fired,
confirmed, refuted or validated. The nightly build is the only thing that confirms,
and falsifier language is never front-facing.
