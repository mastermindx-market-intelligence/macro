"""engine.prophet_live.interval — the armed-pack interval contract. ONE reader.

The nightly pack publishes, per name, the price interval over which
:func:`engine.signal_gate.is_buyable` is true WHEN THAT PRICE IS APPENDED as the next
session's bar — the construction tonight's nightly will actually run, not a
restatement of the last bar (``armed_pack.probe_series``). Three things read that
interval: the pack's own build-time parity check, the */5 evaluator, and the G0.1
parity test.
Divergence between any two of them is the exact failure mode gate G0.1 exists to
catch — a level that looks right on both sides and is wrong — so the arithmetic
lives here once and nowhere else.

STDLIB ONLY, deliberately. :mod:`engine.prophet_live.armed_pack` needs pandas to
probe; the */5 lane installs ``pyyaml boto3`` and no pandas. Putting the contract in
the heavy module would make ``import live_states`` raise ModuleNotFoundError on the
lane it exists to serve.

It also owns the PRICE-ADJUSTMENT VOCABULARY (W-L0 gate 3), for the same reason: the
pack builder, the */5 evaluator and the nightly reconciler all have to name the basis
of every number they publish, and three copies of that vocabulary is how two of them
end up disagreeing about what "adjusted" meant.

#: ``stale`` is NOT a verdict: it marks a name for which no gate ran at all (its

# THE DEFECT THIS VOCABULARY EXISTS FOR. Armed edges are probed on the nightly store's
# close series, which is split+dividend adjusted; the live tape prints raw vendor
# quotes; and the nightly ledger derived ``close_vs_cross_pct``/``fill_vs_cross_pct``
# by dividing an ADJUSTED close by a RAW cross print. On a name with a distribution
# between the cross and the read, the error IS the dividend — measured on this repo at
# 0.649% for CFG (``engine.price_ladder``, the same finding one layer down).
#
# NOT ``price_basis``: :mod:`engine.live_quotes` already owns that name for the
# LIVENESS rung a quote came off (``trade|minute|day|prev|regular``), which is a
# different axis and rides in the same artifacts under the JSON key ``basis``. Naming
# this one ``price_basis`` too would put two unrelated meanings on one word in one
# payload. The values deliberately mirror :mod:`engine.price_ladder`'s
# ADJUSTED/UNADJUSTED families rather than minting a third vocabulary; that module
# cannot be imported here (it needs pandas, and the */5 lane installs none), so
# ``tests/test_prophet_live_basis.py`` pins the two against each other instead.

#: The store family the nightly gate and the armed edges are computed on.
ADJUSTED = "split_and_dividend_adjusted"
#: A raw vendor print: what the live tape and the quote feed's ``prevClose`` carry, and
#: what the breadth close caches accrue between rebuilds (``price_ladder`` calls the
#: same family ``closes_cache_UNADJUSTED``).
UNADJUSTED = "unadjusted_vendor_print"

#: What a pack entry's ``as_of_close`` is on when the pack did not stamp the name
#: itself. The store's DOMINANT family, not a universal claim: a pack that stamps
#: ``price_adjustment`` per name overrides this, and the breadth-cache names are
#: exactly the ones that need to.
DEFAULT_PACK_ADJUSTMENT = ADJUSTED

#: What the live quote plane carries, at every rung. ``engine.live_quotes`` reads
#: Polygon's snapshot (``lastTrade.p`` / ``prevDay.c``) and Yahoo's spark
#: (``regularMarketPrice`` / ``previousClose``); neither request carries an adjustment
#: parameter, because neither endpoint has one — a live quote is the nominal print.
#: Stated rather than converted, on purpose: converting a live quote to the adjusted
#: basis would put a number on the tape that no exchange ever printed.

    absent, below fade_hi_px is absent, therefore buyable", and a runaway 25% past
    the band top reads the same way even though the real gate rejects it there (the
    not-topped veto). Both were reproduced on a real pack entry. The evaluator asks
    this FIRST and refuses to report a verdict when the answer is no.

    ``band_lo_px`` IS 0 FOR A CROSS-CLASS NAME, AND THAT 0 IS A SENTINEL, NOT A FLOOR
    (W-L0 gate 5, 2026-08-09). Its span starts at the as-of close and runs UP, so the
    pack has measured nothing at all below that close. The 0 used to be defended as
    knowledge — "the centre verdict already says not-buyable for a gate whose product
    structure is a cross UP" — and that argument does not hold:

      * the buyable set this module describes is an INTERVAL, not an up-ray. The pack
        publishes an upper edge (``fade_hi_px``, the not-topped veto) and an
        ``irregular`` state for multi-run structure, so "not buyable at the close" is
        entirely consistent with "buyable below the close" — a name rejected for
        being extended has its buyable region UNDER its own close, exactly where the
        cross-class probe never looks;
      * the centre verdict constrains ONE price. Extending it downward is an
        inference from an assumed shape, and an inference is not a measurement. A
        24-fixture sweep of the real gate (9 down-ladder points each, 198 gate calls)
        found no name buyable below its own close — which makes the inference
        plausible and unrefuted, i.e. precisely the epistemic status that is not
        knowledge. House law: "not found yet" is not "does not exist", and a null
        licenses no affirmative claim.

    So the 0 stays as the published span sentinel — re-probing downward would double
    the cross-class probe cost inside a budget that already caps coverage — and
    :func:`probe_floor` names the real floor instead. ``live_states`` labels a read
    below it ``unknown`` rather than reporting ``dormant``/``near`` there.
