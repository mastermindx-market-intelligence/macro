"""Pure valuation-scenario calculator (V1) -- FROZEN SPEC B-F07-1.

No IO, no network, no clock. Consumes already-loaded per-fiscal-year
statement rows (engine.stock_fundamentals._load_statements() shape) and
emits the valuation_scenario.v1 blob for exactly one pinned issuer.

Frozen formula (spec section 2, corrected 2026-09-06 -- review B-F07-1 MAJOR-1):
  per_share = (net_income * (1 + sales_growth_pct/100)
               * (1 + (margin_delta_pp/100) / net_margin_base)
               * earnings_multiple) / share_count

An earnings (P/E) multiple already yields equity value per share -- net
debt/cash lives inside net income via interest expense, so subtracting or
adding it on top of an earnings multiple double-counts the balance sheet.
The bridge term was removed; net_debt/net_cash is reported ONLY as a base
fact (informational), never applied inside the scenario math, matching the
plain-language assumption text shown on every card ("valued at N x
earnings" never mentions a debt bridge).

net_margin_base = net_income / revenue for the SAME fiscal row. Two separate
guards apply to it (review round 3 MAJOR-1 corrected the first version of
this, which only had the second guard and left a live defect at 1.0-1.5%
margins):

  1. A 1% floor is an additional sanity floor, NOT the computability gate: a
     margin base below 1% in magnitude is treated as an unusable base
     (missing), never as a denominator, because margin_delta_pp/net_margin_base
     blows up for a thin-margin issuer (review round 2 MINOR-2).
  2. The real gate is PER SCENARIO: a scenario is computable only when its own
     adjusted-income factor is strictly positive, i.e.
     net_margin_base + margin_delta_pp/100 > 0 for THAT scenario. A margin
     base can clear the 1% floor above and still be too thin for a specific
     scenario's own delta -- e.g. a 1.2% margin base clears the floor, but
     Cautious's -1.5pp delta still drives 0.012 + (-1.5/100) = -0.003 <= 0, so
     Cautious alone is gated out (reason "margin_too_thin") while Base and
     Upbeat, whose deltas do not push the factor non-positive, still render.
     Round 2's fix gated only on the 1% floor (guard 1), which left every
     margin in [1.0%, 1.5%) still producing a negative per_share for
     Cautious -- caught by review round 3 running the module directly at
     margin=1.2%.

net_debt = debt_lt + debt_cur - cash, computed ONLY when all three legs are
reported (None otherwise). This is deliberately stricter than the shared
identity in engine/stock_fundamentals._net_debt (which defaults a missing
leg to 0) -- this module is re-implemented rather than imported, and the
contract here is "null means not reported, never imputed" with no exception.

Input column names (fixed 2026-09-06 -- review B-F07-1 BLOCKER B1): the rows
passed in are engine.stock_fundamentals._load_statements() records, sourced
from collectors/edgar_facts.py's FLOW/BALANCE/BALANCE_SHARES concept tables.
Net income is read as "ni" (FLOW["ni"] = NetIncomeLoss/ProfitLoss) -- the same
column engine.stock_fundamentals._piotroski/_altman/_valuation_ratios all
read (see e.g. "pe = mktcap / ni" there). A prior revision read "net_income",
a key that does not exist anywhere in the real schema, so every AAPL row
silently produced net_income=None and every scenario read "can't be computed
without reported net income" against live data despite the field being fully
reported -- caught only because no test built its fixture from the real
column names. Every other input this module reads (revenue, op_income, cash,
debt_lt, debt_cur, shares, fy, period_end) already matches the loader's real
column name 1:1; "shares" is CommonStockSharesOutstanding (share count
identity "outstanding", not "diluted" -- the loader has no diluted share
count column, only a diluted EPS column ("eps_diluted"), which is a
per-share ratio, not a share count, and is deliberately not used here).
tests/test_valuation_scenario.py asserts the fixture's field set is a subset
of the loader's declared columns so this class of bug cannot pass silently
again.

Forbidden by construction: no consensus, no estimates, no price targets, no
probability/confidence wording, no LLM-authored numbers, no ranking/score.
