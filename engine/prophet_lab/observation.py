"""engine/prophet_lab/observation.py — observation-class classification (LAB-0 §4).

Pure functions over already-read data: no filesystem access happens here (see
``sources.py`` for that).  The rule, restated from the frozen doc:

* No baseline marker at all -> EVERY event is ``retrospective_seed``
  (fail-honest: the absence of proof of a continuous live baseline is treated
  as proof of absence, never as "probably fine").
* A baseline exists -> an event is ``live_forward`` only when its
  ``first_observed_at`` (earliest spool envelope ``pass_ts``) falls inside the
  claimed continuous-coverage window: at or after ``baseline_started_at`` and,
  when ``continuous_through`` is given, at or before it.
* Everything else (no known first observation, before the baseline, after the
  claimed coverage window) is ``retrospective_seed``.

Seeds always carry ``evidence_eligible=False`` and a ``None`` measured lead —
the LAB-0 §4 rule that only true live_forward observations may ever show a
measured Lab→Prophet lead.

    ``None`` unless the row is ``live_forward`` AND both timestamps are
    present — a seed NEVER shows a measured lead, always, per LAB-0 §4.

    Review B1: a lead is reported ONLY when the Prophet anchor POSTDATES the
    Lab's first observation — i.e. only when the Lab genuinely led Prophet.
    An anchor at or before the Lab's observation is not a "negative lead", it
    is a different fact entirely (Prophet recorded the name before the Lab's
    baseline saw it, or on the same day) and is never emitted as a signed
    lead — this function returns ``None`` for that case rather than a
    negative or zero integer a UI could mistake for "the Lab was N days
    behind".

    Deliberate ASYMMETRY between the two sides (temporal review round 2, S2):
    the LAB side (``first_observed_at``) is a full ISO-8601 spool instant, so
    it goes through :func:`engine.prophet_lab.timeparse.parse_instant` and its
    UTC ``.date()`` — never a raw ``[:10]`` slice of the original string,
    which takes the OFFSET-LOCAL calendar date and silently gets the wrong
    day whenever the offset crosses midnight UTC (measured:
    ``"2026-08-19T20:00:00-05:00"`` is ``2026-08-20T01:00:00Z`` — the UTC
    date is the 20th, but ``[:10]`` reads "2026-08-19"). The PROPHET side
    (``prophet_anchor_at``) legitimately IS a bare ``YYYY-MM-DD`` calendar
    date (Prophet plan ``signal_date``/``entry_date`` carry no time or offset
    at all — there is no instant to parse), so it keeps the ``[:10]``-then-
    ``date.fromisoformat`` reading unchanged; parsing it as an instant would
    require inventing a time-of-day this package does not have.
