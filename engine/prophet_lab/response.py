"""engine/prophet_lab/response.py — assembles the ``prophet.lab_board/v1`` payload.

The single orchestration point: reads every source through the injectable
roots in ``sources.py``, then calls each pure board builder in ``boards.py``
and wraps the six boards in the frozen response envelope (LAB-0 §5) —
generation/source health, the all-false authority block, and the boards
themselves.  Nothing here writes anything; this module has no ``open(...,

    configured or fails with no fallback available.

    ``radar_spool_source_label`` (review S2, cheap half) is not a filesystem

    (``app/prophet_lab.py``) resolved ``radar_spool_dir`` from — kept purely
    as an operator diagnostic (``health.radar_spool_local_dir_env``, below).
