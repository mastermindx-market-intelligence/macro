"""engine/prophet_lab/sources.py — injectable-root readers for the Lab.

Every reader here takes its root as an explicit argument (a directory or file
path) so the whole projection is offline-testable against fixtures — no
reader resolves a production path by itself, and none of them import the
Radar detector/scoring stack.  This is the READ half of LAB-0 §1: filter,
join, decorate — never compute a detector formula, never read a forward
outcome, never write a store.

Radar envelope reading is a DELIBERATE REIMPLEMENTATION, not a reuse, of
``scripts/reconcile_entry_radar.py::read_spool_events``: that reader expects a
flat ``mastermind.entry_event.v1`` record per file, which is the exact W4
transport mismatch LAB-0 §6 R-LAB-1 is fixing (a sibling PR, files this
worktree may not touch).  :func:`read_radar_envelopes` reads the real
``entry_radar.events/v1`` ENVELOPE shape (``schema``/``pass_ts``/``events[]``)
that :func:`engine.entry_radar.live_ledger.build_event_payload` actually
writes, so the Lab does not inherit the bug and does not wait on its fix.

COMMISSIONING PREP (day-2, LAB-0 §6): :func:`resolve_radar_spool` teaches
this reader the SAME R2-first-else-local backend ladder the Radar spool
WRITER uses, via the one Radar import this package makes at all —
``engine.entry_radar.spool`` (a stdlib/``contracts.py``-only leaf, never the
detector/scoring stack ``live_ledger``/``challengers``/``detectors`` pull in
— see ``RADAR_EVENT_SPOOL_PREFIX`` below for why that constant is restated
rather than imported from ``live_ledger``). This module still runs no
detector formula, reads no forward outcome, and writes no store — the R2
calls are reads only, same as everything else here.

    """Read OUTCOME, not just directory presence (review S4/S7).

    ``configured`` — a root was given at all. ``dir_exists`` — that root is a
    real directory (or, for the R2 backend, that the LIST call itself
    succeeded — see ``backend`` below). ``envelopes`` — the successfully
    parsed ``entry_radar.events/v1`` objects. ``files_seen``/
    ``envelopes_skipped`` — how many candidate files/objects were found vs.
    how many of those (or the envelopes inside a list-shaped file) were
    torn/off-schema and dropped.  A schema drift that silently empties every
    envelope (S7's failure mode) shows up here as ``envelopes_skipped > 0``
    with ``envelopes == []``, rather than as an indistinguishable "nothing to
    read" — the health block surfaces this directly instead of collapsing it
    into ``is_dir()``.

    ``backend`` (day-2 commissioning-prep addition, LAB-0 §6) — which
    transport actually resolved: ``"r2"``, ``"local"``, or ``"unconfigured"``.
    Mirrors the exact ladder the Radar spool WRITER uses
    (``engine.entry_radar.spool.NominationSpool._put``: R2 when credentials
    exist, else a local dir). ``error`` — set when R2 was attempted and the
    LIST call itself failed (a credential/permission/network problem): fail
    CLOSED and VISIBLE, never an empty-board-as-if-clean, per LAB-0 §6's
    explicit requirement. ``error`` can be set even when ``backend=="local"``
    — that is the R2-failed-but-a-local-fallback-succeeded case; the failure
    stays visible in the health block even though a board could still be
    built from the fallback data.

    ``bucket``/``prefix`` (review S4) -- set on an R2 read (success OR
    failure) to the exact bucket/prefix that was queried. A LIST that
    succeeds with zero keys is legitimately ambiguous ("no passes yet" vs.
    "pointed at the wrong bucket/prefix") and cannot be fully disambiguated
    from inside this reader -- but naming what was actually queried lets an
    operator check it against the writer's own config in one glance, which
    is the health block's job whenever a result cannot self-certify.

    ``local_path`` (review round 3, NEW-3) -- set on a LOCAL read to the
    exact directory that was actually walked (the SCOPED path, i.e.
    ``local_dir/prefix`` when scoping applied) -- parity with ``bucket``/
    ``prefix`` for the R2 side. An operator debugging "why is this empty"
    should never have to guess which directory this reader actually looked

# Radar live output — episode ledger (nonterminal state, C1 board)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#: §13's three TERMINAL states verbatim (``engine.entry_radar.detectors.TERMINAL_STATES``),
#: restated as plain strings rather than imported. This module reads exactly
#: three fields off an episode record (``detector_id``, ``ticker``, ``state``)
#: to answer one question — "is this unit's CURRENT episode nonterminal" — and
#: does not need the full ``LiveEpisode`` dataclass, its §13 validation
#: machinery, or the Radar detector stack that machinery transitively pulls
#: in to answer it. Measured: importing ``engine.entry_radar.live_ledger`` for
#: this alone pulled ~150 unrelated engine/*.py files into the closure of
#: every consumer that reaches this module (CI ci-pack-10 finding, 2026-08-19)
#: — Radar's OWN pre-existing internal fan-out (challengers/detectors reach
#: the US board/stock-scoring engine subsystem), not anything this package
#: needs. Reading the three fields directly keeps the Lab's own promise
#: (LAB-0 §1: a projection layer, never a second detector stack) honest at
#: the IMPORT level, not just the call level.
_TERMINAL_STATES = frozenset({"INVALIDATED", "EXPIRED", "RESOLVED"})

#: The runtime ledger's own file name (``engine.entry_radar.live_ledger._LEDGER_FILE``),
#: restated for the same reason as ``_TERMINAL_STATES`` above.
