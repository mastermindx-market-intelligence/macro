"""Mastermind emit — the actionable, ranked alt-data signal feed for the portfolio bot.

Fuses the three layers into ONE machine-readable contract the Mastermind bot consumes via
its `altdata_flow` lens:

  * the DETERMINISTIC weighted convergence (engine.altdata_signals by_ticker),
  * the OPUS brain's conviction / action / direction + falsifiable thesis (engine.altdata_brain),
  * the INFLUENCE graph affiliations (which important actors are connected to the name),

into a per-ticker ``signal_score`` (0-100), an ``action`` (ACCUMULATE / WATCH / AVOID) and a
``direction`` (long / short / neutral). Per the desk's mandate this IS an actionable axis —
but the bot applies its own risk framework on top, and every brain call is graded vs SPY so
the axis stays calibrated. When the brain is absent (no token), the feed degrades to the
deterministic convergence with conviction derived from the weighted score.

Writes site/altdata/mastermind.json (+ a data copy). The schema is documented inline so the
bot can read it cold.
