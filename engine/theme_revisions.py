"""Theme revision-breadth broadening — T4 of the Thematic Foresight Desk
(research/THEMATIC_FORESIGHT_DESK.md).

THE IDEA. Analyst EPS-estimate revisions are *lagging* if you wait for them to print,
but they TREND hard once they start (Mill Street: ~83% one-month persistence, IC≈0.23) —
so revision-breadth is the **confirmation / runway gauge** of a theme, never the entry.
The entry thesis is the physical bottleneck (engine/bottleneck.py); this leg answers the
companion question: *has the revision wave started for this theme, and is it broadening?*

The HBM template makes the use explicit:
  TIGHT bottleneck + FLAT revision breadth  = PRECIPICE (early — the June-2024 state)
  TIGHT bottleneck + RISING breadth, narrowing dispersion = runway CONFIRMED.

We roll the per-name revision reads (collectors/equity_revisions.py ->
data/revisions/{latest,history}.parquet; cols net_up_30d, breadth, est_chg_30d/90d,
n_analysts, asof) up to each curated theme in config `themes:` (memory_storage,
ai_semiconductors, semicap_equipment, ...). The `breadth_accel` broadening gauge is a
point-in-time DERIVATIVE off history.parquet — it reports INSUFFICIENT_HISTORY until the
PIT archive (which only began accruing recently) spans the lookback, so there is no
look-ahead. Pure given the two existing stores; DISPLAY-ONLY, never a scored leg.

W1c (P1-B): adaptive broadening lookback + 30v90 drift proxy.
  - ACCEL_LOOKBACK_DAYS (21d) is now the *preference*; if only MIN_ACCEL_DAYS (10d) is
    available the real derivative is computed on that shorter window and `basis_days` is
    set to reflect the actual window used — the read is honest about its basis.
  - When no ≥MIN_ACCEL_DAYS prior snapshot exists, a display-only proxy is computed from per-member
    est_chg_30d vs est_chg_90d: 30d drift > 90d pace ⇒ accelerating.  The directional read is
    emitted as `broadening_proxy_state` (+ `broadening_proxy: True`, `basis: "drift_30v90"`)
    while `broadening_state` STAYS INSUFFICIENT_HISTORY — the level-derived proxy must never
    reach the scored acceleration axis, which cannot see the proxy flag.
  - Falls back to INSUFFICIENT_HISTORY only when neither the archive nor the proxy inputs
    are present.
