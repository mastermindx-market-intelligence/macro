"""Pure composer for the US ``liquidity_central_banks`` workspace snapshot (F01 / R3).

Reads TWO owner-native artifacts (plus one optional history-metadata artifact)
and projects them into a ``mastermind.macro_workspace_snapshot.v1`` body:

* ``site/liquiditydata/global_liquidity_transmission.json`` (schema
  ``global_liquidity_transmission.v1``, model ``glt_state.v1``, W-LIQ.1) - the
  global monetary/USD-funding impulse state: ``state.monetary_impulse`` (raw
  weekly change of a causal expanding z-score), ``state.monetary_impulse_z``
  (the causal expanding z of that change, itself requiring a 52-week owner
  warmup before it is computable), ``state.monetary_stance``,
  ``state.orthogonalised_impulse``, ``state.liquidity_breadth``,
  ``state.usd_funding_impulse``, ``state.policy_liquidity_impulse``,
  ``state.credit_impulse_global`` (structurally refused - see below),
  ``state.label`` (``expanding``/``flat``/``contracting``/``unknown``) and
  ``state.event_reference.quality`` (a SEPARATE closed vocabulary -
  ``easing``/``tightening``/``mixed``/``unknown``, the owner's own
  state-vs-US-quality AGREEMENT label, never a synonym for the direction
  label and never a data-quality score); plus the top-level ``freshness``
  block (the conservative all-evidence ``clocks.evidence_available_at``,
  per-component receipts, and ``monetary_coverage_ratio``/
  ``funding_coverage_ratio``) and the top-level ``quality`` block (data
  lineage/coverage disclosure - degraded flag, missing/stale legs, the
  ``global_credit`` refusal, and a ``confidence`` figure the owner itself
  labels ``data_lineage_and_coverage_only`` and explicitly NOT a predictive
  probability, alpha confidence, or promotion grade);
* the ``cb_desk`` block of ``data/intl_risk/latest.json`` (``engine.cb_desk``)
  - Fed/ECB/BoJ balance-sheet level + 13-week/52-week percent-change impulse,
  each with its own ``asof``/``unit``/``series``;
* ``data/global_liquidity_transmission/state_history_meta.json`` (optional) -
  history-depth metadata (row count, first/last asof) used only to disclose
  the GLT state-history artifact in ``sources``, never to fabricate a
  ``series`` timeseries this composer cannot see row-by-row.

GATE STATUS: architecture 10.9's "same-carrier repair required" gate on
Macro PR #6296 (the W-LIQ.1 global-liquidity transmission producer) is
CLEARED - PR #6296 merged to main 2026-09-04 as 38fd57a6 - so this composer
may consume the GLT artifact as an accepted owner input.

SCOPE BOUNDARY (disclosed, not silently narrowed): architecture 10.9's long-run
"Required composition" also names reserves, TGA, RRP, repo/funding facilities,
and swap-line context (US liquidity quantity/quality, ``data/regime/latest.json``
``liquidity_quality`` block - the SAME owner path ``liquidity_regime.py`` and
``financial_conditions.py`` already read). This bounded R3 packet's owner-input
set is fixed to exactly the two artifacts above (plus the optional history
metadata); it does NOT read ``data/regime/latest.json``. TGA/RRP/reserves
context is therefore not composed here - a future revision may extend
``required_components`` once explicitly directed to add that owner path. This
composer never claims that context exists by omission: it is absent from
``metrics``/``drivers`` entirely, not published as a fabricated null leg.

RESOLVED OWNER DEFECT (guard retained, never silently corrected): cb_desk's
FED ``bs_impulse.level`` was historically WALCL's raw FRED reading (natively
MILLIONS of USD) under a ``unit`` label claiming "USD billions". The owner
fixed this at source on 2026-09-04: cb_desk now normalizes every
balance-sheet level into its published unit via ``bs_unit_mult`` (FED/ECB
into billions from FRED-native millions; BoJ into JPY billions from
FRED-native 100-million JPY). This composer STILL never rescales or corrects
the number. The deterministic sanity check scoped to ``series == "WALCL"``
is RETAINED as a regression tripwire: if a defective vintage reappears (the
label says "billions" but the raw level is implausible at that scale), the
LEVEL leg (only) is refused as SOURCE_FAILED with an honest note; the
unit-free 13-week/52-week PERCENT-CHANGE legs are unaffected and still
published, since a percent change is scale-invariant.

FRESHNESS LAW: GLT publishes on a W-FRI weekly grid (``meta.frequency``). A
mid-week build is CURRENT relative to the last Friday grid tip; this composer
is LATE_WITHIN_TOLERANCE only once built_at has passed the next expected
Friday plus a disclosed grace window, and STALE_SOURCE beyond that (see
``_glt_freshness`` / ``_GLT_CADENCE_DAYS`` / ``_GLT_RELEASE_GRACE_DAYS``).
Per-leg GLT freshness (the FED/ECB/BoJ monetary contribution and the
broad-dollar/HY-OAS/real-10y funding contribution) additionally consults that
leg's OWN ``freshness.components.<group>.<name>.status`` receipt - an
"unusable" leg can never read CURRENT purely from date math. This is the
owner's typed no-look-ahead design; a quality degradation the owner itself
discloses (``quality.status == "degraded"``, e.g. because ``global_credit``
lacks comparable point-in-time coverage) is surfaced honestly via
``availability.reasons`` and a dedicated implication - it is never "fixed",
smoothed over, or silently dropped.

CONTRADICTION DETECTION: GLT's own directional read (``state.label`` -
expanding/contracting) is compared against the Fed's OWN cb_desk 13-week
balance-sheet percent change. When GLT reads decisively expanding/contracting,
the Fed's own 13w change is outside a disclosed flat band, and the two
directions disagree, this composer emits a typed ``global_state_vs_fed_desk``
DISAGREEMENT (never a composer-invented magnitude threshold beyond the one
disclosed flat-band constant). It stays silent whenever GLT itself reads
flat/unknown or the Fed leg is absent/flat - never forced.

HEADLINE: architecture section 10.9 gives this workspace NO headline model at
all - unlike ``liquidity_regime``/``financial_conditions``/``growth``'s
explicit x/y quadrant blueprints, or even ``monetary_policy``'s own
composition-list headline, section 10.9 has no "Headline model" subsection.
Per the ``monetary_policy`` precedent, ``headline.state_id`` stays ``null``
and typed NOT_APPLICABLE (a real vocabulary member, section 7.7) rather than
inventing an axis the architecture never specified; ``axes.items`` stays an
empty (schema-legal) array. The real headline content (global monetary/
funding impulse, Fed/ECB/BoJ balance-sheet impulses, the global-vs-Fed-desk
agreement check) lives in ``metrics``/``drivers``/``implications`` instead.

REGION: published as ``US`` like every current workspace page, though this
composer's owner inputs are explicitly global (Fed/ECB/BoJ) - disclosed via
the ``region_scope_disclosure`` implication rather than left implicit.

DRIVERS BUCKET REUSE (disclosed, mirrors ``financial_conditions.py``): the
contract's ``drivers`` block is closed to exactly ``{rate_side,
balance_sheet}``. ``balance_sheet`` carries the Fed/ECB/BoJ 13-week
balance-sheet impulses (a literal fit). ``rate_side`` carries the GLT USD
funding-side contribution legs (broad dollar / HY OAS / real 10y yield) -
NOT policy rates - because this workspace has no separate funding bucket to
use; the reuse is disclosed in each driver's own ``note`` and in the
``driver_bucket_naming_note`` implication.

NO rank/gate/size/trade authority. NO LLM-originated facts. Descriptive
ceiling only. Depends only on the standard library. The composer NEVER reads
a wall clock: ``built_at`` is passed in by the builder, and every staleness/
age check is a pure function of ``built_at`` and the owner artifacts' own
clocks, so an identical set of owner inputs always yields an identical
snapshot body.
