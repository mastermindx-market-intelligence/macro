"""Pure composer for the US ``inflation_system`` workspace snapshot (F01 R2 packet).

Reads exactly one owner-native artifact -- ``inflation_intelligence.v1``
(``data/release_forecast/inflation_intelligence.json``, produced by
``engine.inflation_intelligence.build_inflation_intelligence``) -- and projects
it into a ``mastermind.macro_workspace_snapshot.v1`` body. Mirrors the R1A
``liquidity_regime`` composer's structure and typed-degradation discipline
(architecture section 7 house law); see the note near the bottom of this
docstring for the one remaining forced reuse a future schema revision should fix.

It:

* builds a dual-axis quadrant state
    x = inflation impulse     (disinflationary -> inflationary)
    y = persistence / breadth (narrow-transitory -> broad-persistent)
  with four descriptive quadrants A/B/C/D and disclosed hysteresis, reusing
  the SAME domain-agnostic boundary/hysteresis math as liquidity_regime
  (BOUNDARY=50, HYSTERESIS_BAND=5) -- nothing about that math is liquidity-
  specific;
* publishes each axis's components, signs, weights, coverage floor, frequency
  alignment, thresholds, definition/data versions, and revision behaviour
  (composite/axis law, architecture section 7.9);
* NEVER re-derives a CPI/PCE value from parquet: every published number is
  either read verbatim from ``inflation_intelligence.v1`` (mom_pct, yoy_pct,
  annualized_3m_pct, annualized_6m_pct, acceleration_3m_minus_6m_pp -- all
  already computed by the owner engine) or a disclosed ALGEBRAIC transform of
  exactly one owner-published scalar (a spread between two owner numbers, or
  compounding one owner MoM point to an annualized rate) -- never a fresh
  read of a FRED parquet file;
* keeps ``reference_period`` (the CPI print's calendar month) and
  ``calculation_as_of``/``released_at`` distinct per the inflation-specific
  clock law: CPI/PCE structurally lag their reference month by weeks, so a
  component's freshness is judged against the OWNER's own publication-lag
  tolerance, never against wall-clock "today";
* emits TYPED degraded states, never zero/neutral/calm:
    - a required component's owner value missing  -> SOURCE_FAILED
    - owner classifies the source "stale"          -> STALE_SOURCE
    - the in-progress-month nowcast has no model
      entry yet                                    -> NOT_YET_RELEASED
    - axis coverage below the floor                -> value null + COMPUTATION_REFUSED
    - the sticky-led proxy mix persists while the
      headline impulse reads disinflationary       -> a typed contradiction (DISAGREEMENT)
    - no comparable prior print                     -> vector/changes WARMUP
    - prior print on a different method              -> changes METHOD_CHANGED (refuses deltas)

NO rank/gate/size/trade authority. NO LLM-originated facts. Descriptive
ceiling only. Depends only on the standard library. The composer NEVER reads
a wall clock: ``built_at`` and any evaluation clock are passed in by the
builder, so an identical owner input always yields an identical snapshot body.

Consumes ONLY a real, already-accepted owner artifact (``inflation_intelligence.v1``,
itself display_only/authority=False end-to-end). This does NOT promote the
records-only Rates & Inflation F0 architecture doc into a live F1-F3 claim
(architecture section 10.6 gate) -- ``inflation_intelligence.v1`` is a
separate, already-built, already-on-disk engine output, not that doc.

AXIS IDS: ``axis_id`` is published natively as ``inflation_impulse`` /
``persistence_breadth`` per the orchestrator's contract ruling that the
shared schema's ``axis_id`` enum is being widened to a lowercase-snake-case
pattern in the integration pass -- no borrowed liquidity_regime wire ids.

DEVIATION NOTE (one remaining forced reuse, kept as-is for v1 -- see the R1A
report's "deviations" section): the shared closed schema's ``drivers`` object
still has two fixed keys (``rate_side`` / ``balance_sheet``), not
parameterized per workspace. This module repurposes them as "x-axis drivers"
/ "y-axis drivers" buckets for ``inflation_impulse`` / ``persistence_breadth``
respectively.
