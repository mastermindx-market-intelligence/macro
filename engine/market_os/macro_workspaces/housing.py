"""Pure composer for the US ``housing_real_estate`` workspace snapshot (F01 / R5).

Reads FIVE raw, ALREADY-LOADED level series -- four FRED parquet series plus one
Zillow series -- and projects them into a ``mastermind.macro_workspace_snapshot.v1``
body:

* ``fred_frames`` -- a dict ``{series_id: rows_or_None}`` where ``rows`` is a plain
  Python list of ``(date, value)`` pairs (or longer tuples -- extra elements are
  ignored, see the digest tests' unconsumed-field negative control) read from
  ``data/fred/<series_id>.parquet``. Exactly four series are consumed:
  ``MORTGAGE30US`` (Freddie Mac PMMS 30y fixed mortgage rate, weekly, column
  ``mortgage_30y``), ``HOUST`` (Census housing starts SAAR, monthly, column
  ``housing_starts``), ``PERMIT`` (Census building permits SAAR, monthly, column
  ``building_permits``), ``CSUSHPISA`` (S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller US National HPI,
  SA, monthly, column ``case_shiller_sa``) -- column names per ``config.yml:211-214``.
  Any OTHER key in ``fred_frames`` is ignored (this composer never iterates the
  dict blindly; it only ever reads the four series ids it names).
* ``zori`` -- a plain rows list (or ``None``) for Zillow's national ZORI rent index
  (``data/zori/national.parquet``, column ``zori``; see the SA/NSA disclosure below).

This composer never loads a parquet file itself and never imports pandas -- see
the hand-off's "build.py loader spec" for the small ``_load_fred_series(path)``
helper the BUILDER (not this module) needs to add, derived from the WRITER's own
code (``collectors/fred.py`` / ``lib/store.py`` / ``scripts/collect_zori.py``),
never inspected via a live parquet read (this authoring session had no shell).

CENSUS BINDING (2026-09-04 F01 R5/R6 source census + CEO rights rulings,
``research/market_intelligence_productization/
MARKET_ONTOLOGY_F01_R5R6_SOURCE_CENSUS_AND_RIGHTS_RULINGS_2026-09-04.md`` section 2
and rulings R-1..R-5): Housing ships v1 as COMPOSABLE-CORE + TYPED-ABSENT REMAINDER,
not the full architecture-10.10 required composition. The composable core is
EXACTLY the four FRED series above (VERIFIED present as ``data/fred/<SERIES>.parquet``
at authoring time) plus national ZORI when its store is populated. Everything the
architecture's "required composition" additionally names -- existing/pending home
sales, completions/new-home sales, Redfin high-frequency inventory/pending/price-
drop/DOM -- is published as a TYPED-ABSENT remainder leg with an honest reason,
never estimated from a different series and never silently dropped from the page.

RIGHTS LAWS (binding, ruling-cited, never re-litigated inline):
* R-1: Case-Shiller reaches this estate via FRED (CSUSHPISA). Neutral attribution
  only -- displayed as "Case-Shiller US National (via FRED)", never re-branded as
  this estate's own index.
* R-2: Freddie Mac PMMS (MORTGAGE30US) via FRED -- same posture as R-1.
* R-3: NAR terms bar STORAGE in a retrieval system (not merely redistribution) --
  existing/pending-home-sales legs that would need NAR are typed RIGHTS_BLOCKED.
  No NAR-derived series is ever stored, and no "affordability index" this composer
  might one day build is ever labeled as NAR's.
* Completions / new-home sales would need a NEW Census-bureau collector (Census
  New Residential Sales; no COMPUTSA-equivalent is registered anywhere in this
  estate per the census) -- this composer does not build collectors; typed
  NOT_COVERED.
* Redfin high-frequency (``scripts/collect_redfin_hf.py``): the collector IS real
  and nightly-wired, but ``data/redfin_hf/`` was EMPTY on the checked runner
  (silent-fail try/except, per the census) -- typed SOURCE_FAILED, an honest
  "collector exists, store empty" state, never NOT_COVERED (that token is reserved
  for legs with no collector at all). The +50-day publication-lag machinery
  (``scripts/housing_hf_phase0.py`` PIT_LAG_DAYS=50, tightened from an optimistic
  30d) and the ~34.5% calendar-seasonality correction Redfin's price-drop share
  needs are both DISCLOSED here but NOT implemented in this composer -- there is no
  data flowing yet for either to operate on; a future revision wires them once
  ``data/redfin_hf/`` is populated.

PIT / REVISION LAW: no ALFRED point-in-time vintage capture exists for ANY housing
series today (not MORTGAGE30US, HOUST, PERMIT, CSUSHPISA, or ZORI). Every level and
derived read below is therefore the LATEST-REVISED value as currently stored --
Census construction data in particular is revised for months after first release,
and a later re-read of the same reference period can show a different number with
no "as it was known then" alternative to fall back on. This is disclosed via the
``no_alfred_pit_vintage_capture`` implication, never silently assumed away.

SA / NSA MIXING LAW: CSUSHPISA and the two Census construction series (HOUST,
PERMIT) are seasonally adjusted (SA) by the publishing agency's own convention;
MORTGAGE30US is a market rate series SA does not apply to. ZORI's OWN collector
docstring (``scripts/collect_zori.py``) describes it as "smoothed, seasonally
adjusted", but the binding 2026-09-04 census recorded it as NOT seasonally adjusted
after inspecting the stored data. This composer cannot execute code in this
authoring environment to arbitrate that conflict against the parquet's own embedded
metadata, so it follows the BINDING census ruling (ZORI = NSA) and tags the read
"(unverified)" in the metric's own transformation text -- and, regardless of which
side of that dispute is correct, NEVER combines ZORI with the SA Case-Shiller series
in one derived value (no mixed-basis ratio, spread, or z-score is ever computed
across the two). The one cross-series derived read this composer DOES publish,
``permits_minus_starts_spread``, subtracts two same-basis SA series (HOUST, PERMIT)
-- never a same-basis-violating pair.

HEADLINE (read this before "fixing" it -- mirrors ``business_activity.py``'s note):
architecture section 10.10 DOES define a real two-axis blueprint (x: demand/
transaction momentum, weak -> strong; y: affordability/financing pressure,
restrictive -> supportive; supply overlay: scarce -> abundant) -- unlike
``monetary_policy``/``liquidity_central_banks``, which have NO headline-model
subsection at all and are therefore honestly ``NOT_APPLICABLE`` by design. Housing
is a DIFFERENT case: the blueprint exists, but the composable-core substrate cannot
compute it. The x-axis needs a demand/transaction-momentum read (existing-home
sales -- RIGHTS_BLOCKED; Redfin pending sales -- SOURCE_FAILED, empty store); the
y-axis needs a genuine affordability COMPOSITE (price-to-income), and this
composer has no income series to build one from -- publishing the single
``mortgage_30y_rate_level`` metric AS an "affordability" axis would fabricate a
composite exactly the way business_activity's docstring warns against. So:
``headline.state_id`` stays ``null`` with ``status="ABSENT"`` and
``null_reason="COMPUTATION_REFUSED"`` (a data refusal, NOT a design
"not-applicable" -- the distinction business_activity.py's own headline already
establishes as estate precedent), and ``axes.items`` stays ``[]`` (schema-legal).
The supply overlay ("scarce -> abundant") IS genuinely computable from HOUST/PERMIT
-- it is published honestly as real metrics/drivers (levels, YoY, the
permits-minus-starts spread) instead of being smuggled into a fabricated quadrant
the contract has no dedicated "overlay" slot for anyway.

CONTRADICTION: architecture 10.10's own alert vocabulary names "rent/home-price
divergence" as an eligible condition. When both Case-Shiller YoY and ZORI YoY are
present and their signs disagree beyond a disclosed flat band, this composer emits
a typed ``home_price_vs_rent_divergence`` DISAGREEMENT on the two implicated
metrics -- a genuine, owner-native two-series read, never a fabricated threshold
beyond the one disclosed flat-band constant.

DRIVERS BUCKET REUSE (disclosed, mirrors ``liquidity_central_banks.py``): the
contract's ``drivers`` block is closed to exactly ``{rate_side, balance_sheet}``.
``rate_side`` is a literal fit for the mortgage-rate legs. ``balance_sheet`` carries
the supply/price/rent legs (starts, permits, the spread, Case-Shiller YoY, ZORI
YoY) -- NOT a balance sheet -- because Housing has no dedicated "supply" bucket to
use; disclosed in the ``driver_bucket_naming_note`` implication, never left implicit.

NO rank/gate/size/trade authority. NO LLM-originated facts. Descriptive ceiling
only. Depends only on the standard library (no pandas import here -- the caller
supplies plain rows so this module stays testable without pandas). The composer
NEVER reads a wall clock: ``built_at`` is supplied by the caller, and every
staleness/age/lookback check is a pure function of ``built_at`` and the given rows,
so an identical set of owner inputs always yields an identical snapshot body.
