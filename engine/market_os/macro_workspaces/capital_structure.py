"""Pure composer for the US ``capital_structure`` workspace snapshot (F01 / R4).

Reads ONE owner-native artifact and projects it into a
``mastermind.macro_workspace_snapshot.v1`` body:

* ``data/capital_structure/projection.json`` (schema
  ``capital_structure.projection_bundle.v1`` / per-record schema
  ``capital_structure.projection.v1``, producer ``WS:CAPITAL-STRUCTURE-
  INTELLIGENCE-V2``) -- a nightly, issuer-scoped projection of SEC-filing
  CAPITAL-STRUCTURE EVENTS (shelf registrations, current reports, corporate
  actions, ...): a top-level ``coverage`` census (issuer/event/classification/
  review/edge counts, a ``freshness``/``generation_freshness`` pair with their
  OWN disclosed SLAs, a ``horizon_state``/``horizon_reason_codes`` discovery-
  lag disclosure, and a ``source_status``), a ``records`` array of ONE entry
  per issuer (identity, a per-issuer ``coverage`` census, a ``timeline`` of
  observed events, and the issuer's own ``latest_observed_event``), a
  ``source_receipt`` (artifact hashes and the underlying SEC form-policy
  ledger receipt), and -- critically -- an ``unavailable`` list disclosed at
  BOTH the whole-projection level and every individual record: ``[
  "active_instrument_overhang", "cash_runway", "financing_probability",
  "fully_diluted_shares", "instruments", "normalized_terms",
  "offering_ability", "remaining_capacity" ]``.

READ-ONLY PROJECTION LAW (why this composer never ranks or scores)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
This workspace projects the existing ``WS:CAPITAL-STRUCTURE-INTELLIGENCE-V2``
owner; it creates no new truth, extracts no instrument terms, and ranks
nothing (the owner's OWN ``authority`` block already discloses
``is_context_only: true`` and every ``*_authority`` flag ``false`` -- this
composer's fixed contract authority block agrees with, never overrides, that
owner-native disclosure). The reference "Structure" section other financial
products ship is GLOBAL WEALTH COMPOSITION (equities/bonds/real assets by
sector), not corporate capital structure -- an unrelated concept sharing only
a word. Architecture section 10.3 is deliberately reference-absent for this
workspace: no reference layout is imitated here; only what section 10.3
itself specifies is implemented.

WHY THE HEADLINE IS ALWAYS COMPUTATION_REFUSED (read this before "fixing" it)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Architecture 10.3 DOES define a two-axis headline blueprint:

    x-axis: refinancing pressure,                low -> high
    y-axis: balance-sheet resilience/market access, weak -> strong

-- unlike ``monetary_policy``/``liquidity_central_banks`` (10.7/10.9), which
define NO headline model at all and are therefore correctly ``NOT_APPLICABLE``.
Capital Structure is different: a blueprint exists, but the single owner
artifact this composer is scoped to read cannot honestly support it. Computing
"refinancing pressure" needs a maturity/refinancing wall and financing
capacity; computing "balance-sheet resilience/market access" needs cash
runway and instrument-level headroom. The owner artifact's own top-level AND
per-record ``unavailable`` lists name exactly those fields --
``active_instrument_overhang``, ``cash_runway``, ``financing_probability``,
``fully_diluted_shares``, ``instruments``, ``normalized_terms``,
``offering_ability``, ``remaining_capacity`` -- as not currently published,
at every issuer and in aggregate. Synthesizing a quadrant score from event/
filing CLASSIFICATION metadata alone (what this artifact actually carries)
would be a fabricated methodology dressed as a real one -- exactly what
section 7.7 ("Missing never becomes zero, neutral, unchanged...") and the
composer laws ("never invent methodology over data the owner itself
discloses it does not have") forbid. This mirrors ``business_activity.py``'s
own headline refusal precedent more closely than ``monetary_policy``'s: a
blueprint is named, but the currently available owner substrate cannot
support it, so ``headline.null_reason`` is the data-insufficiency member
``COMPUTATION_REFUSED``, not the model-absence member ``NOT_APPLICABLE``
(both are real vocabulary members, section 7.7, but they mean different
things and this composer does not conflate them). ``axes.items`` stays an
empty (schema-legal) array; ``drivers`` stays ``{"rate_side": [],
"balance_sheet": []}`` (schema-legal empty -- there is no axis to have
driving components in the first place; the ``rate_side``/``balance_sheet``
container names are inherited R1A liquidity-regime naming, never generalized
in the closed schema, and simply unused here rather than repurposed).

WHAT THIS COMPOSER ACTUALLY PUBLISHES INSTEAD
-------------------------------------------------
The real, owner-published, honestly-aggregable content:

* the owner's OWN top-level ``coverage`` census, propagated as-is (issuer/
  event/classification/deferred/review/edge counts, the ``freshness`` /
  ``generation_freshness`` pair with their own disclosed SLAs, and the
  ``horizon_state`` discovery-lag disclosure) -- never recomputed;
* TWO composer-derived ratios that are honest divisions of two owner-
  published counts (``classified_event_count / event_count`` and
  ``review_count / event_count``) -- no invented weighting, no threshold;
* a SINGLE pass over ``records`` (this module never loads the projection --
  ``build.py`` does -- and never iterates it more than once) computing plain
  per-issuer CENSUS counts of fields that genuinely exist on every record:
  how many issuers have a "classified" latest event, a pending review, a
  shelf-registration as their latest event family (architecture 10.3's
  "issuance and refinancing conditions" leg -- disclosed as a coarse census,
  never a scored issuance-conditions index), a non-empty relationships edge
  list, a non-null ``correction_of`` (architecture 10.3's "amendment/
  correction lineage" leg), or an owner-flagged event contradiction
  (``coverage.contradiction_ids``, this composer's ONLY contradiction
  signal -- entirely owner-native, never a composer-invented threshold);
* a TYPED ``NOT_COVERED`` metric for every entry in the owner's own
  top-level ``unavailable`` list, one metric per disclosed name (data-driven,
  not a hardcoded guess at the owner's vocabulary) -- the owner's typed
  degradation is surfaced, never masked, exactly matching architecture 10.3's
  named-but-unavailable required-composition legs (maturity/refinancing wall,
  coverage/leverage/covenant context).

SCOPE BOUNDARY (disclosed, not silently narrowed): this composer reads
EXACTLY ONE owner path, ``data/capital_structure/projection.json``. It never
opens ``data/regime/latest.json`` or any Financial-Conditions/Rates-owner
artifact, so architecture 10.3's "aggregate credit-spread and financing-cost
context" leg is NOT_COVERED here even though a HY-OAS/spread reading exists
elsewhere in this repository -- that context belongs to the Financial
Conditions / Monetary Policy workspaces, never duplicated into this one by
reaching outside the scoped owner input. "Issuer and sector drilldowns" and
"portfolio exposure join at request time" are both explicitly request-time UI
concerns, not snapshot aggregates: this composer NEVER republishes the
``records`` array itself (the composer law: aggregate, never republish the
record set), so no single-issuer metric appears here.

FRESHNESS LAW: the owner publishes on a nightly cadence (``coverage.
generation_freshness`` carries the owner's own ~30h SLA disclosure). This
composer's OWN freshness is a pure function of ``built_at`` vs the owner's
``generated_at`` -- CURRENT within a disclosed 36h nightly-cadence tolerance,
LATE_WITHIN_TOLERANCE within a further 12h grace, STALE_SOURCE beyond that
(see ``_NIGHTLY_CURRENT_HOURS`` / ``_NIGHTLY_GRACE_HOURS``) -- and can only
ever be DOWNGRADED (never upgraded) by the owner's own disclosed
``coverage.source_status`` reading something other than ``"ok"`` (the same
no-look-ahead law ``liquidity_central_banks.py`` uses for GLT leg receipts).
This is a DIFFERENT concept from the owner's own ``coverage.freshness`` /
``coverage.generation_freshness`` enums (event-detection-latency and
generation-compile-latency SLAs respectively) -- both are propagated as their
own separate categorical metrics, never conflated with this composer's
CURRENT/LATE_WITHIN_TOLERANCE/STALE_SOURCE freshness taxonomy.

NO rank/gate/size/trade authority. NO LLM-originated facts. Descriptive
ceiling only. Depends only on the standard library. The composer NEVER reads
a wall clock: ``built_at`` is passed in by the builder, and every staleness/
age check is a pure function of ``built_at`` and the owner artifact's own
clocks, so an identical owner input always yields an identical snapshot body.
