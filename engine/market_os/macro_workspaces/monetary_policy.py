"""Pure composer for the US ``monetary_policy`` workspace snapshot (F01 / R2).

Reads THREE owner-native artifacts and projects them into a
``mastermind.macro_workspace_snapshot.v1`` body:

* ``data/rates_command/latest.json`` (schema ``rates_command.v1``) - policy rate,
  futures-implied path, FOMC SEP dots, the dots-vs-market gap, hawk/ease
  pressure legs, and the owner's own divergence flags;
* the ``cb_desk`` block of ``data/intl_risk/latest.json`` (``engine.cb_desk``) -
  realized Fed/ECB/BoJ/BoE/SNB/BoC/RBA policy rates with per-CB ``stale``
  flags, balance-sheet impulse (WALCL/ECBASSETSW/JPNASSETS), and the next
  scheduled meeting date+day-count as computed AT THE CB-DESK BUILD TIME
  (``data/intl_risk/cb_calendar.yml``, official CB calendar pages);
* the ``rate_inflation_transmission`` block of ``data/regime/latest.json`` -
  nominal/real 10y, the 2s10s curve, and 10y breakeven.

DEVIATION FROM THE R1A HEADLINE SHAPE (see module-level note in ``_headline``):
architecture section 10.7 gives Monetary Policy a headline COMPOSITION LIST
(policy rates, futures path, curve, balance sheet, divergence, calendar), not
an x/y quadrant like ``liquidity_regime``. The committed
``macro_workspace_snapshot.v1`` schema's ``headline.state_id`` is closed to
``["A","B","C","D",null]`` and ``axes.items[].axis_id`` is closed to
``["funding_pressure","balance_sheet_support"]`` - both liquidity-regime-
specific enums this composer must not (and per the no-shared-file-edits
constraint, cannot) repurpose. This composer resolves that honestly: it never
invents a quadrant. ``headline.state_id`` is always ``null`` /
``NOT_APPLICABLE`` and ``axes.items`` is always ``[]`` (schema-legal - no
``minItems``), and the REAL headline content (policy rates, market-implied
path, curve, balance sheet, meeting calendar, divergence) is carried entirely
in ``metrics`` / ``drivers`` / ``implications``, each fully typed under the
metric law (section 7.4).

It:
* carries every KPI under the full metric law (section 7.4) with distinct
  clocks - the pre-computed "days to next meeting" in the owner cb_desk
  artifact is propagated AS-IS with its OWN ``calculation_as_of`` (the cb_desk
  build timestamp), never recomputed against this composer's ``built_at``
  (section 7.5's clock law; this composer never reads a wall clock itself);
* labels every futures/market-implied field's ``basis`` honestly as
  ``market_implied_futures_price_not_forecast`` - a market PRICE, never a
  Fed forecast or stated intent (architecture 10.7 authority law);
* propagates the FOMC SEP dot-plot median AS PUBLISHED BY THE OWNER
  (``rates_command``/``regime.fed_path``, itself sourced from FRED FEDTARMD);
  this composer never fabricates or estimates a dot;
* emits TYPED degraded states, never zero/neutral/calm:
    - a required source missing              -> SOURCE_FAILED
    - a required source flagged stale         -> STALE_SOURCE (owner "stale"
      flag or this composer's disclosed age tolerance vs the given built_at)
    - a required source not yet released      -> NOT_YET_RELEASED
    - fewer than 2 central banks report a
      policy rate (global divergence refused) -> value null + COMPUTATION_REFUSED
    - the market-implied path diverges from
      the FOMC SEP median beyond the owner's
      own disclosed tolerance                 -> a typed contradiction (DISAGREEMENT)
    - hawkish and easing pressure legs both
      active and roughly balanced             -> a second, independent typed
      contradiction (DISAGREEMENT)
    - no comparable prior print               -> changes/corrections WARMUP
    - prior print on a different method       -> changes METHOD_CHANGED (refuses deltas)

NO rank/gate/size/trade authority. NO LLM-originated facts, no policy-intent
prediction (architecture 10.7 authority law: "the page cannot call a market
path a forecast by the central bank"). Descriptive ceiling only. Depends only
on the standard library. The composer NEVER reads a wall clock: ``built_at``
is passed in by the builder, and every staleness/age check is a pure function
of ``built_at`` and the owner artifacts' own clocks, so an identical set of
owner inputs always yields an identical snapshot body.
