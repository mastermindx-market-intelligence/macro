"""Pure composer for the US ``consumer_payments`` workspace snapshot (F01 / R1B).

Reads NINE raw, ALREADY-LOADED level series -- all FRED parquet series -- and
projects them into a ``mastermind.macro_workspace_snapshot.v1`` body:

* ``fred_frames`` -- a dict ``{series_id: rows_or_None}`` where ``rows`` is a
  plain Python list of ``(date, value)`` pairs (or longer tuples -- extra
  elements are ignored, mirrors ``housing.py``'s unconsumed-field negative
  control) read from ``data/fred/<series_id>.parquet``. Exactly NINE series
  are consumed (column names per the orchestrator's same-commit config.yml
  append, listed alongside each series id below); any OTHER key in
  ``fred_frames`` is ignored -- this composer never iterates the dict
  blindly, only ever reads the nine series ids it names.

TODAY'S DISK TRUTH (2026-09-04, per the F01 R1B hand-off): only two of the
nine series are populated --

* ``RSAFS`` (retail sales, column ``retail_sales``) -- monthly $M SA,
  period-start dated, latest row 2026-07-01, 415 rows, VERIFIED present.
* ``UMCSENT`` (Michigan consumer sentiment, column ``umich_sentiment``) --
  monthly index, period-start dated, latest row 2026-07-01, 675 rows,
  VERIFIED present.

The remaining SEVEN are being appended to ``config.yml``'s ``fred.series`` in
the SAME commit that ships this composer; the nightly collector populates
their parquets LATER -- today those parquet files are ABSENT, so the builder
passes ``None`` for each. This composer treats a ``None`` frame as the
honest typed absence (housing precedent: absent value -> SOURCE_FAILED
freshness at the availability layer; metric value null with null_reason
SOURCE_FAILED) and SELF-HEALS the instant real rows are supplied -- every
derived read, the credit-stress axis, and the three-leg contradiction below
are pure functions of whatever rows are handed in, never a hardcoded "still
early" branch:

* ``TOTALSL`` (total consumer credit, column ``consumer_credit_total``),
  ``REVOLSL`` (revolving, column ``consumer_credit_revolving``), ``NONREVSL``
  (nonrevolving, column ``consumer_credit_nonrevolving``) -- G.19 consumer
  credit, monthly $bn SA, period-start dated.
* ``PSAVERT`` (personal saving rate, column ``personal_saving_rate``) --
  monthly percent, BEA, period-start dated.
* ``DSPIC96`` (real disposable personal income, column
  ``real_disposable_income``) -- monthly, chained dollars (base year per
  FRED series metadata -- NOT verified in this authoring environment, see
  judgment call 15), SAAR, BEA, period-start dated.
* ``DRCCLACBS`` (credit-card delinquency rate, column
  ``cc_delinquency_rate``), ``DRSFRMACBS`` (single-family-residential
  mortgage delinquency rate, column ``mortgage_delinquency_rate``) --
  quarterly percent, period-START dated on FRED.

SCOPE (architecture section 10.11, "Consumer & Payments" required
composition): real income/disposable income/spending/saving; goods/services
and discretionary/essential spending "where the source permits" (this
estate's composable core has none of that split -- RSAFS is a single
aggregate, disclosed, never estimated); revolving and nonrevolving credit;
delinquency context "only from accepted sources" (DRCCLACBS/DRSFRMACBS,
both public FRED series, are accepted); payments proxies "only where lawful
and methodologically stable" (card/transaction panels are a standing
exclusion -- see the RIGHTS_BLOCKED note below); revisions and
seasonal-adjustment changes (see the no-PIT-vintage disclosure).

RIGHTS / SCOPE LAWS (binding, doc-cited, never re-litigated inline):
* Card-network / processor transaction-volume panels (Yipit, Earnest
  Research, Consumer Edge, Bloomberg Second Measure, and equivalents) are
  typed ``RIGHTS_BLOCKED`` (``payments_panel_card_network`` metric), citing
  ``docs/QUAL_DATA_COMPLIANCE.md`` section 2.3 verbatim: "These panels
  aggregate individual payment transactions. The data originates from bank
  partnerships or card-network agreements; the downstream compliance burden
  includes verifying that each data vendor's underlying consent framework is
  intact, that individual transaction records are appropriately anonymized
  at the cell level, and that the aggregate product does not permit
  re-identification." This composer reads that section as a RIGHTS-adjacent
  posture, not a pure scope/backlog gap -- see judgment call 3 for the full
  disclosed reasoning and the rejected NOT_COVERED alternative.
* NY Fed Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit (QHDC) panels are
  typed ``NOT_COVERED`` (``household_debt_panel_nyfed_qhdc`` metric): no
  collector for that release exists anywhere in this estate today. This
  composer does not build new collectors; a future revision may add one.

CENSUS BINDING / VERIFICATION LIMIT: none of the nine series above were
inspected via a live parquet read in this authoring environment (no shell).
RSAFS/UMCSENT presence and row counts, and the seven pending series' current
absence, are per the F01 R1B hand-off's own disclosed source census, taken
as given.

PIT / REVISION LAW: no ALFRED point-in-time vintage capture exists for any
series on this page today (same law as ``housing.py``'s
``no_alfred_pit_vintage_capture`` disclosure). Every level and derived read
below is the LATEST-REVISED value as currently stored, never an "as it was
known then" reconstruction -- BEA income/saving and Census retail-sales
figures in particular are revised for months after first release.

SA / NSA + UNIT-SCALE LAWS: every series here is seasonally adjusted (SA) by
the publishing agency's own convention EXCEPT the two quarterly delinquency
rates, which FRED publishes NSA (not seasonally adjusted; delinquency has no
standard SA convention). No derived read in this composer ever mixes an SA
series with the NSA delinquency reads. Separately -- the task's own
disclosed trap -- RSAFS is denominated in USD MILLIONS while the G.19 credit
series (TOTALSL/REVOLSL/NONREVSL) and DSPIC96 are USD BILLIONS; every
metric's ``unit`` field states the scale explicitly
(``usd_millions_sa`` vs ``usd_billions_sa`` / ``usd_billions_chained_saar``)
and no metric or derived read ever divides/subtracts across the two scales
(see judgment call 14).

HEADLINE (read this before "fixing" it -- mirrors ``housing.py``'s own
note): architecture section 10.11 DOES define a real two-axis blueprint --
unlike ``monetary_policy``/``liquidity_central_banks`` (no headline-model
subsection at all, honestly ``NOT_APPLICABLE``) --

    x-axis: real household cash-flow/spending momentum, weak -> strong
    y-axis: consumer credit stress, low -> high

Unlike Housing (whose blueprint the composable core can NEVER fill, so its
headline is PERMANENTLY refused), this blueprint IS genuinely computable
once its owner inputs exist -- so this composer implements REAL axis
computation (weighted composites over standardized components, a coverage
floor, hysteresis, quadrant classification -- the ``liquidity_regime.py``
pattern), not a permanent stub. TODAY, though, every y-axis (credit-stress)
leg is one of the seven pending series, so the REAL first build refuses the
headline as ``COMPUTATION_REFUSED`` (never ``NOT_APPLICABLE`` -- this is a
data gap, not a design absence) with ``axes.items`` still populated (each
axis object's ``components`` array is always emitted, showing exactly which
legs are present/absent) -- the refusal path is first-class, not an
afterthought: every test in the paired suite that composes with the
"pending" fixture set (mirroring the real first build) asserts this exact
refused shape.

x-axis (``cash_flow_momentum``): retail_sales_yoy + real_disposable_income_yoy,
BOTH required present (leg-floor law, judgment call 6) -- never averaged from
a single leg.
y-axis (``credit_stress``): consumer_credit_revolving_yoy (0.30),
personal_saving_rate_level inverted (0.25), cc_delinquency_rate_level (0.25),
mortgage_delinquency_rate_level (0.20); needs >= 2 of 4 legs AND >= 50%
coverage (``liquidity_regime.py``'s own coverage-floor law, judgment call 7).

CONTRADICTION: a three-leg "confidence vs. credit-financed spending"
divergence -- consumer sentiment rising, revolving-credit growth
accelerating, AND the saving rate falling, all beyond disclosed flat bands,
simultaneously -- is a genuine, owner-native pattern (architecture 10.11's
own alert vocabulary names "spending/income divergence"): it means reported
strength may be credit-financed rather than income-financed, a fragility
signal the sentiment/spending legs alone would miss. Scoped to exactly the
three metrics the architecture names (judgment call 12); never propagated
into the credit-stress axis's own value/component status (judgment call 16).

DRIVERS BUCKET REUSE (disclosed, mirrors ``housing.py`` /
``liquidity_central_banks.py``): the contract's ``drivers`` block is closed
to exactly ``{rate_side, balance_sheet}``. Neither literally fits Consumer.
``rate_side`` carries the cash-flow-momentum legs (retail sales YoY, real
disposable income YoY); ``balance_sheet`` carries the credit-stress legs
(revolving-credit YoY, saving rate, the two delinquency reads) -- disclosed
in each driver's own note and in the ``driver_bucket_naming_note``
implication.

NO rank/gate/size/trade authority. NO LLM-originated facts. Descriptive
ceiling only. Depends only on the standard library (no pandas import here --
the caller supplies plain rows). The composer NEVER reads a wall clock:
``built_at`` is supplied by the caller, and every staleness/age/lookback
check is a pure function of ``built_at`` and the given rows, so an identical
set of owner inputs always yields an identical snapshot body.

DISCLOSED JUDGMENT CALLS (numbered, never left implicit):

1.  UMCSENT freshness cadence is set to 61 days / 15-day grace, NOT the
    naive "lag ~30d + ~31d cycle -> ~65d" a shallow reading suggests.
    Hand-trace: UMich's FINAL reading for reference month M lands within
    month M itself (~day 25-31, lag ~30d from the period-start date); the
    NEXT month's final (which makes month M's print no longer the newest
    possible) lands ~28-31 days later -- the true worst-case agency cycle is
    therefore lag(30) + interval(31) = 61 days, not 65. Verified against the
    concrete 2026-09-04 calendar fact this hand-off itself raises: a July
    print (2026-07-01) sitting on disk at age 65 days on 2026-09-04 is
    AFTER the August final (~Aug 28-31) should already exist upstream --
    under the correct 61/15 pair this reads ``LATE_WITHIN_TOLERANCE``
    (62-76 days), honestly signalling the print is behind the agency's own
    schedule (collector lag or a delayed release -- this composer cannot
    tell which, and does not guess), rather than a naive 65-day cadence
    that would falsely read it ``CURRENT``. See
    ``test_umcsent_july_print_reads_late_not_current`` for the pinned proof.
2.  RSAFS reuses ``housing.py``'s own Census-construction cadence (80d /
    17d grace) verbatim, per the hand-off's explicit "match construction
    precedent" instruction -- RSAFS is period-start dated and released
    ~17th-19th of M+1, the same release-calendar shape as HOUST/PERMIT.
3.  Card-network/processor payments panels are typed ``RIGHTS_BLOCKED``,
    not ``NOT_COVERED``. The alternative NOT_COVERED reading (QUAL_DATA_
    COMPLIANCE.md section 2 is titled "Exclusions as Deliberate Policy" --
    Mastermind's OWN choice, not an externally imposed contract term like
    housing's NAR ruling R-3) was considered and rejected: section 2.3's own
    text frames the barrier as a RIGHTS/consent/anonymization problem
    inherent to the underlying data ("verifying that each data vendor's
    underlying consent framework is intact... does not permit
    re-identification"), not an engineering backlog item a collector could
    ever close -- unlike a genuine NOT_COVERED gap (e.g. this composer's own
    NY Fed QHDC leg, judgment call 4), no amount of collector-building work
    would ever change this leg's status. RIGHTS_BLOCKED best matches that
    permanence.
4.  NY Fed QHDC household-debt panels are typed ``NOT_COVERED`` (no
    collector exists anywhere in this estate) -- a pure scope gap, not a
    rights question; a future collector could close it.
5.  Architecture 10.11's real x/y blueprint is implemented as genuinely
    computable (unlike Housing's permanently-refused stub) -- it
    self-heals once the pending G.19/BEA/delinquency series populate; the
    REAL first build (today's mostly-absent shape) is a first-class tested
    path, not an afterthought.
6.  X-axis leg floor: retail_sales_yoy AND real_disposable_income_yoy are
    BOTH required (``coverage_floor=1.0``) -- a spending read without an
    income read (or vice versa) is never averaged from a single leg and
    published as "cash-flow momentum".
7.  Y-axis reuses ``liquidity_regime.py``'s own min_components=2-of-4 /
    coverage_floor=0.5 pattern (not a stricter all-4 floor), because its
    four legs span genuinely different cadences (G.19 monthly, BEA monthly,
    delinquency quarterly) that will rarely all refresh in the same build.
8.  Saving-rate and delinquency standardization use fixed, disclosed
    floor/ceiling/neutral anchors (not a live percentile engine) --
    explicitly composer-invented transformations, the same posture as
    ``liquidity_regime.py``'s own quality-label-to-support-score mapping.
9.  ``personal_saving_rate_level`` is the first axis component in this
    estate's composers to carry ``sign = -1``: a raw INCREASE in the saving
    rate maps to a standardized DECREASE in the credit-stress axis. Every
    other sibling composer's axis components use ``sign = +1`` only, so this
    is disclosed explicitly rather than left as a silent first.
10. MoM/YoY lookback slack reuses ``housing.py``'s own disclosed monthly
    slack constant (20 days) verbatim rather than inventing a second,
    possibly-inconsistent value.
11. ``personal_saving_rate_change_3m`` mirrors ``housing.py``'s
    ``mortgage_30y_rate_change_13w`` derived-read pattern (a trailing
    level-difference, refused rather than defaulted to zero when history is
    insufficient), adapted to a ~91-day BEA-cadence lookback.
12. The three-leg contradiction is scoped to exactly the mechanism
    architecture 10.11 names (sentiment, revolving credit, saving rate) --
    it deliberately excludes real_disposable_income even though that series
    is also read by this composer, to avoid inventing a fourth leg the
    architecture never named.
13. Drivers-bucket reuse (see module docstring above) is disclosed in both
    each driver's own note and a dedicated implication.
14. RSAFS ($M) is never divided, subtracted, or averaged against a $bn
    series (G.19 / DSPIC96) in any derived read; every metric's ``unit``
    field states its scale explicitly.
15. DSPIC96's chained-dollar base year could not be verified without a
    shell read of the parquet/FRED series metadata; the unit is disclosed
    generically ("chained dollars, base year per FRED series metadata") in
    the metric's transformation text rather than asserting an unverified
    base year.
16. A fired contradiction marks DISAGREEMENT on exactly the three
    implicated METRIC entries (consumer_sentiment_yoy,
    consumer_credit_revolving_yoy, personal_saving_rate_change_3m); it is
    never propagated into the credit_stress axis's own value_status or its
    revolving-credit component's coverage_state, since the contradiction's
    three legs only partially overlap with the axis's four components and
    forcibly flipping the whole axis status would overstate its scope.
