"""Pure composer for the US ``growth_real_economy`` workspace snapshot (F01 / R2).

Reads owner-native artifacts (canonically ``data/regime/latest.json``, the same
canonical regime read used by ``liquidity_regime.py``) and projects them into a
``mastermind.macro_workspace_snapshot.v1`` body. Mirrors the R1A
``liquidity_regime`` composer's structure and typed-degradation discipline:

* builds a dual-axis quadrant state
    x = growth momentum      (deteriorating -> accelerating)
    y = growth level/breadth (weak -> strong)
  with four descriptive quadrants A/B/C/D and disclosed hysteresis, mirroring
  architecture 10.2's headline model;
* preserves the Leading -> Coincident -> Lagging SEQUENCE separately (never
  averaged into the headline composite) as individually-clocked metrics --
  only leading+coincident momentum/breadth feed the x/y composite; lagging is
  published purely as trailing confirmation context (architecture 10.2: "A
  secondary sequence view preserves Leading -> Coincident -> Lagging rather
  than averaging the tiers into one scalar");
* publishes full composite-law disclosure (component list, signs, weights,
  coverage floor, thresholds, definition/data versions, revision behaviour --
  section 7.9) for the two composites as real ``axes.items`` entries,
  ``axis_id`` = ``growth_momentum`` / ``growth_level_breadth`` (the shared
  schema's axis_id enum has been widened by the orchestrator's integration
  pass beyond the original two liquidity_regime values); the same
  composite-level summary is ALSO carried in
  ``metrics[growth_momentum]/[growth_level_breadth].transformation`` so a
  metrics-only reader gets it too;
* emits a typed nowcast-vs-hard-data DISAGREEMENT when GDPNow signals strong
  acceleration while the coincident hard-data tier is still trending down
  (architecture 10.2: "nowcast versus hard-data disagreement" is REQUIRED
  composition; "nowcast/hard-data contradiction" is a named failure state),
  and a second typed DISAGREEMENT when the coincident index level reads
  strong while its diffusion (breadth) is narrow;
* emits TYPED degraded states, never zero/neutral/calm:
    - a required source missing              -> SOURCE_FAILED
    - the whole business_cycle owner offline  -> SOURCE_FAILED
    - the owner artifact flagged stale        -> STALE_SOURCE
    - axis coverage below the floor           -> value null + COMPUTATION_REFUSED
    - no comparable prior print               -> vector/changes WARMUP
    - prior print on a different method       -> changes METHOD_CHANGED (refuses deltas)
    - stale/uncalibrated business-cycle model -> a descriptive caveat implication
      (architecture 10.2 failure state: "recession label unsupported by the
      accepted calibration")

SCHEMA KEY LAW (read before touching this file): the ``drivers`` block is
closed to exactly the keys ``rate_side`` / ``balance_sheet`` -- names
inherited from the ``liquidity_regime`` workspace and left as-is for v1 (the
buckets themselves are not being widened/renamed in this pass). This
composer publishes growth-momentum drivers under ``rate_side`` and
growth-level/breadth drivers under ``balance_sheet`` -- semantically
repurposed, not renamed, with an explicit one-line disclosure baked into
every driver's own ``note`` field so a reader of the driver object itself is
never misled.

``axes.items[*].components`` reuses the SAME component dicts (built by
:func:`_component`) that feed the x/y composite math, so a fired contradiction
mutates ``coverage_state``/``value_status`` in place before the axis object is
constructed -- the axis-level DISAGREEMENT and the composite metric's
DISAGREEMENT always agree, they are two views of the same underlying state.

NO rank/gate/size/trade authority. NO LLM-originated facts. Descriptive
ceiling only. Depends only on the standard library. The composer NEVER reads
a wall clock: ``built_at`` and any evaluation clock are passed in by the
builder, and freshness is derived from owner-provided flags, so an identical
owner input always yields an identical snapshot body.
