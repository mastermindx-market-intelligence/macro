"""Pure composer for the US ``national_debt_liabilities`` workspace snapshot (F01 / R6).

Reads FOUR raw, ALREADY-LOADED owner inputs -- three Daily-Treasury-Statement (DTS)
flow/level series, a Treasury-auction results table, two BIS quarterly panels, and
one small owner-artifact passthrough -- and projects them into a
``mastermind.macro_workspace_snapshot.v1`` body:

* ``treasury_frames`` -- a dict ``{"tga": rows, "net_issuance": rows,
  "withheld_taxes": rows}`` where ``rows`` is a plain Python list of
  ``(date, value)`` pairs (or longer tuples -- extra elements are ignored, see
  the digest tests' unconsumed-field negative control) or ``None``, ascending.
  ``tga`` -> ``data/treasury/tga.parquet`` column ``tga_mn`` (TGA daily closing
  balance); ``net_issuance`` -> ``data/treasury/net_issuance.parquet`` column
  ``net_issuance_mn`` (Issues minus Redemptions, a daily flow); ``withheld_taxes``
  -> ``data/treasury/withheld_taxes.parquet`` column ``withheld_tax_mn`` (withheld
  income & employment-tax deposits, a daily flow). ALL THREE are DTS business-day
  cadence, published the next business day, and ALL THREE are stored in $
  MILLIONS -- the ``_mn`` column-suffix IS the unit contract (build.py's own
  ``_TREASURY_COLUMNS`` mapping names these same three files/columns).
* ``auction_rows`` -- a plain list of dicts (or ``None``), each carrying exactly
  ``auction_date`` (iso str), ``security_type`` (str), ``tenor_years``
  (float|None), ``bid_to_cover`` (float|None), ``high_yield`` (float|None),
  sorted ascending by ``auction_date`` -- ``data/treasury_auctions/auctions.parquet``
  (build.py's ``_load_auction_rows``), the demand side of the Treasury market from
  the keyless TreasuryDirect ``TA_WS/securities/auctioned`` feed.
* ``bis_frames`` -- a dict ``{"dsr": rows, "gap": rows}`` of the SAME ``(date,
  value)`` row shape, quarterly, PERIOD-END dated -- ``data/bis/us_dsr.parquet``
  column ``dsr`` (US household debt-service ratio) and ``data/bis/us_gap.parquet``
  column ``gap`` (US credit-to-GDP gap), per config.yml's ``credit_gap_dsr.panels``
  ``us_dsr``/``us_gap`` mapping. BIS data carries ATTRIBUTION-ONLY rights: every
  metric/implication touching it names "Bank for International Settlements (BIS)"
  explicitly and never rebrands the read as this estate's own.
* ``bonds_latest`` -- ``dict | None``, the raw parsed ``data/bonds/latest.json``
  owner artifact (``scripts/build_bonds.py``): exactly six keys -- ``date``,
  ``health_score`` (0-100), ``health_label`` (closed owner vocabulary
  ``{"healthy", "mixed", "stressed"}``, ``HEALTH_COLOR``/``label_zh`` in
  ``scripts/build_bonds.py``), ``cycle_phase`` (closed owner vocabulary
  ``{"recession", "early", "mid", "late"}``, ``PHASE`` in the same script),
  ``verdict_en``, ``verdict_zh``. This composer projects a SMALL read of that
  state (health_score/health_label/cycle_phase only, judgment call 10 below) --
  it never republishes the owner's own editorial ``verdict_en``/``verdict_zh``
  sentence as if it were this composer's own voice (mirrors
  ``capital_structure.py``'s never-republish-the-record-set law).

LOAD-BEARING GAP (census 2026-09-04, binding, never silently patched): NO debt
STOCK series exists anywhere in this estate -- no Debt-to-the-Penny, no Monthly
Treasury Statement (MTS) receipts/outlays, no TIC foreign-holdings, no
MSPD/weighted-average-maturity ladder. Total-debt-outstanding, debt-to-GDP,
debt-held-by-public, intragovernmental holdings, the deficit/primary balance,
net interest burden, the maturity ladder, foreign holdings, and contingent
liabilities are ALL typed ``NOT_COVERED`` below, one metric per architecture
10.12 "Required composition" leg this estate cannot fill, each with its own
gap-specific transformation note. This composer NEVER integrates
``net_issuance`` into a fabricated stock level -- a flow's running sum is not a
level without a real anchor (an initial stock this estate does not have), and
publishing one would be exactly the "debt-stock/flow confusion" architecture
10.12 names as a failure state, not an honest workaround.

HEADLINE (read this before "fixing" it -- mirrors ``housing.py``'s /
``capital_structure.py``'s own headline-refusal notes): architecture 10.12 DOES
define a real two-axis blueprint (x: refinancing/issuance pressure, low ->
high; y: fiscal capacity/interest-burden resilience, weak -> strong) -- unlike
``monetary_policy``/``liquidity_central_banks``, which have NO headline-model
subsection at all and are therefore honestly ``NOT_APPLICABLE`` by design.
National Debt is the ``housing``/``capital_structure`` case: a blueprint
exists, but the owner substrate this composer actually has cannot honestly
fill it in. The x-axis bundles TWO distinct pressures -- issuance pressure
(computable: ``net_issuance_sum_4w``/``13w``, the pace-delta read) and
REFINANCING pressure specifically (needs a maturity/rollover wall -- the
absent MSPD/WAM ladder, see the load-bearing gap above); the y-axis needs a
genuine fiscal-capacity/interest-burden composite (debt stock, net interest
expense, revenue -- all absent). Publishing the issuance-pressure half alone
AS "refinancing/issuance pressure," or improvising a DIFFERENT unnamed axis
pair (e.g. "issuance pressure x demand absorption") the architecture never
specified, would both be exactly the fabricated-methodology-dressed-as-real
move ``capital_structure.py``'s own docstring forbids. So: ``headline.state_id``
stays ``null`` with ``status="ABSENT"`` and ``null_reason="COMPUTATION_REFUSED"``
(a data refusal, NOT a design "not-applicable"), and ``axes.items`` stays
``[]`` (schema-legal). The real, honestly-computable content -- issuance
pressure, auction demand absorption, the BIS DSR/credit-gap levels, the
bond-desk coverage passthrough, and a genuine cross-source contradiction check
-- is published as real metrics/drivers/implications instead of being smuggled
into a fabricated quadrant the contract has no dedicated "partial axis" slot
for anyway.

CONTRADICTION: a genuine, three-legged, all-owner-native-value check (never a
composer-invented magnitude beyond the disclosed flat bands, judgment calls 8-9
below): when net issuance is genuinely ACCELERATING (the trailing-4-week daily
pace running materially above the trailing-13-week pace), recent auction
demand is genuinely WEAKENING (the recent bid-to-cover average sits materially
below the trailing-year baseline), and the bond desk's OWN health read still
says "healthy" (its calmest closed-vocabulary state), this composer emits a
typed ``issuance_demand_stress_vs_bond_desk_calm`` DISAGREEMENT -- a
supply/demand stress signal the desk has not itself flagged. It stays silent
whenever any of the three legs is absent or inside its disclosed flat band --
never forced.

DRIVERS BUCKET REUSE (disclosed, mirrors ``housing.py``/``liquidity_central_banks.py``):
the contract's ``drivers`` block is closed to exactly ``{rate_side,
balance_sheet}``. ``balance_sheet`` carries TGA/issuance/auction-spread/revenue
flow legs -- TGA's placement is a closer-than-usual natural fit (TGA IS
literally Treasury's own account balance), but the pairing is still disclosed
bucket reuse per house law since net issuance / the auction spread / withheld-
tax YoY are not literally "a balance sheet." ``rate_side`` carries the
yield/credit-cycle-adjacent legs (latest auction high-yield, the BIS DSR/gap
levels) -- NOT policy rates -- because this workspace has no dedicated
"auction"/"credit" bucket to use; disclosed in each driver's own ``note`` and
in the ``driver_bucket_naming_note`` implication.

DISCLOSED JUDGMENT CALLS (numbered, never silently assumed):
 1. Headline stays ``COMPUTATION_REFUSED`` (data-insufficiency), never
    ``NOT_APPLICABLE`` (design-absence) and never a fabricated substitute axis
    pair the architecture never named -- see the HEADLINE note above.
 2. Every dollar metric below is published in RAW $ MILLIONS (unit
    ``usd_mn``), never rescaled to billions -- mirrors
    ``liquidity_central_banks.py``'s WALCL refuse-not-rescale law. Prose may
    convert to $bn purely for readability, always labeled inline, never
    changing the metric's own declared unit.
 3. TGA "impulse" (4w/13w) is a self-referential calendar-day LEVEL CHANGE
    (28d/91d, disclosed lookback slack) -- a DIFFERENT read, for a DIFFERENT
    purpose, from ``engine/treasury_watch.py``'s own extremum-anchored
    EPISODE-DETECTION windowing (``min_episode_bn``/``lookback_extremum_bd``).
    This composer never imports or re-runs ``treasury_watch.py``; it composes
    from the same raw ``tga.parquet`` independently.
 4. Withheld-taxes windowing deliberately DIVERGES from the ALREADY-established
    ``engine/conditions.py`` convention for this exact series (a 63-ROW ~3-month
    rolling sum with a 252-ROW ~1-year shift for YoY, ``config.yml``
    ``labor.withheld_sum_window_d``/``withheld_yoy_window_d``) in favor of a
    tighter CALENDAR-DAY 4-week sum / 365-day YoY window, per this workspace's
    own "4w YoY" revenue-nowcast brief -- a faster pulse for a different
    purpose, never claimed to reproduce ``engine/conditions.py``'s own number
    (see the ``withheld_taxes_window_divergence_disclosure`` implication).
 5. Minimum-row coverage floors for the DTS trailing sums (``_MIN_ROWS_4W=10``,
    ``_MIN_ROWS_13W=30``) are composer judgment calls sized off DTS's
    business-day cadence (~5/7 of calendar days) -- a genuinely-EMPTY or
    too-sparse window is refused (``INSUFFICIENT_HISTORY``) rather than
    silently summing to a misleadingly-small total.
 6. The auction "recent" window (8) mirrors the OWNER's own
    ``config.yml treasury_auctions.trailing: 8`` same-tenor z-score baseline
    window, reused here as a deliberately CROSS-TENOR blend (all security
    types pooled) -- a disclosed scope-boundary departure from the owner's own
    same-tenor scoping, not an oversight; this composer builds no tenor-bucketed
    read. Its minimum-coverage floor (5) mirrors the owner's own
    ``config.yml treasury_auctions.min_trailing: 5``.
 7. The auction "baseline" window (trailing 365 calendar days, ending at the
    latest bid-to-cover auction's OWN date, never ``built_at``) and its
    minimum-coverage floor (10) are both composer-invented, offered as the
    longer-horizon "vs trailing-year baseline" comparison this workspace's own
    brief calls for -- distinct from the owner's own trailing-8 same-tenor
    z-score baseline.
 8. The issuance-acceleration flat band (``_ISSUANCE_PACE_FLAT_BAND_MN_PER_DAY
    = 1000.0``, i.e. $1bn/day) and the auction-demand flat band
    (``_AUCTION_DEMAND_FLAT_BAND = 0.10`` bid-to-cover points) are disclosed
    composer-invented thresholds (mirrors ``liquidity_central_banks.py``'s
    ``_FED_FLAT_BAND_PCT`` / ``housing.py``'s
    ``_HOME_PRICE_RENT_FLAT_BAND_PCT`` precedent) -- never a percentile/z-score
    this composer has no historical distribution to calibrate honestly.
 9. The contradiction's "calm bond desk" leg is scoped EXACTLY to the owner's
    own closed ``health_label`` vocabulary member ``"healthy"``
    (``scripts/build_bonds.py``'s ``HEALTH_COLOR = {healthy, mixed,
    stressed}``) -- ``"mixed"`` is deliberately excluded from "calm," a
    disclosed composer judgment call, not an owner-published threshold.
10. ``bonds_latest`` is projected as a SMALL read (health_score/health_label/
    cycle_phase only); the owner's own editorial ``verdict_en``/``verdict_zh``
    sentence is never republished by this composer's own prose.
11. Fiscal-year tagging: this composer publishes ONLY rolling calendar-day
    windows (4w/13w/365d), never a US-FY(Oct-Sep)-tagged aggregate -- avoiding
    architecture 10.12's own named "fiscal-year/calendar-year mismatch" failure
    state at the cost of a less budget-native cadence (see the
    ``fiscal_year_windowing_disclosure`` implication).
12. Drivers-bucket reuse (rate_side/balance_sheet) -- see the DRIVERS BUCKET
    REUSE note above.

NO rank/gate/size/trade authority. NO LLM-originated facts. Descriptive
ceiling only. Depends only on the standard library (no pandas import here --
the caller supplies plain rows/dicts so this module stays testable without
pandas). The composer NEVER reads a wall clock: ``built_at`` is supplied by
the caller, and every staleness/age/lookback check is a pure function of
``built_at`` and the given rows, so an identical set of owner inputs always
yields an identical snapshot body.
