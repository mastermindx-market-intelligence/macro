"""Pure composer for the US ``rates_curves`` workspace snapshot (beyond-F01
expansion, Chairman-authorized 2026-09-04).

Reads NINETEEN raw, ALREADY-LOADED level series -- all FRED constant-maturity
Treasury (CMT) / policy-corridor parquet series -- and projects them into a
``mastermind.macro_workspace_snapshot.v1`` body:

* ``curve_frames`` -- a dict ``{series_id: rows_or_None}`` where ``rows`` is a
  plain Python list of ``(date, value)`` pairs (or longer tuples -- extra
  elements are ignored, mirrors ``housing.py``'s unconsumed-field negative
  control) read from ``data/fred/<series_id>.parquet``, ascending. Exactly
  NINETEEN series are consumed (column names per ``config.yml`` / the F01 R1B
  hand-off's ``build.py`` loader spec, ``_RATES_FRED_COLUMNS``); any OTHER key
  in ``curve_frames`` is ignored -- this composer never iterates the dict
  blindly, only ever reads the nineteen series ids it names below. All
  nineteen were VERIFIED present as ``data/fred/<SERIES>.parquet`` at
  authoring time (see the hand-off's "what could not be verified without a
  shell" for what a live parquet read would still need to confirm: the exact
  latest row date and row count of each file).

    Nominal CMT curve (percent, investment/bond-equivalent basis):
        DGS3MO=us3m   DGS6MO=us6m   DGS1=us1y   DGS2=us2y   DGS3=us3y
        DGS5=us5y     DGS7=us7y     DGS10=us10y DGS20=us20y DGS30=us30y
    Real yields, TIPS CMT (percent):
        DFII5=us5y_real   DFII10=us10y_real
    Breakevens (percent):
        T10YIE=breakeven_10y   T5YIFR=breakeven_5y5y
    Term premium (percent):
        THREEFYTP10=term_premium_10y  (Kim-Wright 10y)
    Policy corridor (percent):
        EFFR=effr   OBFR=obfr   SOFR=sofr   IORB=iorb

WHY THIS COMPOSER EXISTS (expansion workspace 13, not one of the twelve):
``research/market_intelligence_productization/
MARKET_ONTOLOGY_MACRO_MONETARY_SUITE_ARCHITECTURE_2026-09-04.md`` (the frozen
architecture doc) defines exactly twelve closed macro workspace identities
(``engine.market_os.macro_workspaces.registry.WORKSPACE_IDS``'s original
twelve). Rates & Curves is a Chairman-authorized EXPANSION appended after that
freeze, reaching toward the reference product's fourteen-workspace taxonomy --
it has no architecture section number, no required-composition list, and no
headline-model subsection AT ALL, because the frozen document was never
written with this workspace in mind (see JUDGMENT CALL 1 / the ``_headline``
note below for the consequence this has for ``headline.state_id``).

SEAM DECISION (binding, never re-litigated inline; JUDGMENT CALL 2): this
composer reads FRED Treasury-curve and policy-corridor parquets ONLY. It takes
NO input at all from the ``rates_command`` owner artifact, even though that
artifact already computes a market-implied path, an FOMC dot-plot comparison,
and a yield-momentum read -- ``monetary_policy.py`` already projects exactly
that artifact (its ``board.rate_path_row`` / ``expectations_pressure`` /
``dots`` fields) onto this suite's Monetary Policy page. The REJECTED
alternative: reading ``rates_command`` here too and re-publishing its
yield-momentum leg under a second workspace identity would duplicate an owner
projection another workspace already carries, not add a genuinely new read.
Rates & Curves stays the pure MARKET-CURVE workspace -- built only from the
raw FRED series -- so the two pages can never drift or double-count the same
owner fact.

HEADLINE (read this before "fixing" it -- the consequence of the "no
architecture section" fact above, JUDGMENT CALL 1): unlike ``housing.py`` /
``national_debt.py`` (whose architecture sections DO define a real two-axis
blueprint the composable-core data merely cannot fill, so THEIR headlines are
``COMPUTATION_REFUSED`` -- a data-insufficiency refusal against an EXISTING
blueprint) and like ``monetary_policy.py`` / ``liquidity_central_banks.py``
(whose architecture sections define NO headline-model subsection at all, so
THEIR headlines are honestly ``NOT_APPLICABLE`` -- a design absence, not a
refusal to fill one), Rates & Curves sits in the ``monetary_policy`` case, one
level further removed: there is no architecture section for this workspace to
even NOT define a headline model in. ``headline.state_id`` therefore stays
``null`` with ``status="ABSENT"`` and a null_reason that is a real, closed
vocabulary member describing a design absence, never a fabricated substitute
quadrant this composer invents on its own authority. A future architecture
revision may ratify a genuine two-axis blueprint for this workspace, at which
point this null lawfully flips into a real headline the moment that blueprint
is adopted -- exactly the same lawful-flip relationship ``monetary_policy.py``
already documents for its own design-absence headline. Until then, the real
curve content -- node levels, thirteen-week changes, slopes, inversion status,
curvature, the real/breakeven decomposition, term premium, and the policy
corridor -- is published in full under ``metrics`` / ``drivers`` /
``implications``, never smuggled into a quadrant that has no definition to be
smuggled into. See the ``headline_unavailable`` implication for the
reader-facing version of this note, phrased without the raw closed-vocabulary
token (the leak guard scans every prose field).

SAME-DATE DISCIPLINE (a new house law this composer introduces; JUDGMENT
CALL 3 -- no sibling composer combines two INDEPENDENTLY-CLOCKED series into
one point-in-time read the way a curve spread does): every spread, curvature,
and decomposition read below (2s10s, 3m10y, 5s30s, the butterfly, the
nominal/real/breakeven decomposition, and each policy-corridor spread) is
computed only from a date common to EVERY leg it combines, located as the
LATEST date shared by all of them -- never by pairing each leg's own
separately-latest print under one reported date. When that shared date lags
any single leg's own newest available print by more than the disclosed
``_SAME_DATE_STALENESS_BOUND_DAYS`` tolerance, this composer refuses the read
(``COMPUTATION_REFUSED``) rather than mixing an older print from one leg with
a newer print from another. This generalizes the leg-floor law
``housing.py``'s ``permits_minus_starts_spread`` / ``national_debt.py``'s
``auction_demand_spread_recent_vs_baseline`` already establish (never publish
a composite from fewer legs than it needs) to the EIGHT two- and three-leg
combinations this single-domain workspace carries (JUDGMENT CALL 4 -- the
``_pair_value`` / ``_triple_value`` helpers below are a disclosed
generalization of that sibling pattern, not a new law in spirit).

INVESTMENT-BASIS-ONLY LAW (JUDGMENT CALL 5, disclosed even though it never
actually fires here, because the trap is well-known elsewhere in this estate
-- see ``config.yml``'s own ``DTB3``-vs-``DGS3MO`` inline comment and
``engine/yield_curve.py``'s ``NODES`` convention this composer stays
consistent with, WITHOUT importing that module): every yield node this
composer reads is a constant-maturity, investment (bond-equivalent) basis
FRED series -- internally consistent with every other node here. The
discount-basis Treasury bill rate (FRED ``DTB3``) is a different, structurally
lower-reading series on a different basis and is never one of this
workspace's nineteen inputs, so it can never be mixed with any node published
below.

FRESHNESS (worst-case-age law, JUDGMENT CALL 6 -- mirrors
``national_debt.py``'s DTS cadence derivation exactly): all eighteen CMT/
corridor series are observation-dated and published the next business day, so
the worst-case age of the newest-possible print over a long weekend / holiday
cluster is roughly 4-5 calendar days -- cadence 5d, grace 4d. ``THREEFYTP10``
(the Kim-Wright term premium) publishes with a few days' extra lag beyond a
plain CMT/corridor series -- cadence 9d, grace 5d (JUDGMENT CALL 7, a
composer-derived constant; no other owner in this estate declares a cadence
for this exact series).

REQUIRED / OPTIONAL SPLIT (JUDGMENT CALL 8): fourteen of the nineteen series
are required (``us3m``, ``us6m``, ``us2y``, ``us5y``, ``us10y``, ``us30y``,
``us5y_real``, ``us10y_real``, ``breakeven_10y``, ``breakeven_5y5y``,
``term_premium_10y``, ``effr``, ``sofr``, ``iorb``); the long-tail CMT nodes
(``us1y``, ``us3y``, ``us7y``, ``us20y``) and ``obfr`` are optional -- VERIFIED
by construction: no derived (spread/butterfly/decomposition/corridor) metric
below reads any of these five, so their absence can never degrade
``availability.state`` (optional never degrades, the ``housing.py`` ZORI
precedent).

DERIVED-READ WINDOWS (JUDGMENT CALL 9): the thirteen-week change lookback
uses a 10-calendar-day slack (``_LOOKBACK_SLACK_DAYS``) even though these are
DAILY business-day series that need far less slack than the weekly/monthly
series ``housing.py`` sized this constant for -- a generous, disclosed value
to absorb a holiday cluster sitting exactly on the 91-day boundary, not a
sign this composer expects large gaps in daily CMT data.

INVERSION RUN-LENGTH MINIMUM HISTORY (JUDGMENT CALL 10): the
consecutive-business-day inversion run-length walk (2s10s, 3m10y) refuses
(``INSUFFICIENT_HISTORY``) below ``_MIN_INVERSION_HISTORY_ROWS`` (20)
shared-date historical rows -- a composer-invented floor distinguishing "a
genuinely short run" from "not enough shared history collected yet to tell,"
independent of whether the CURRENT sign itself is known (the sign needs only
the latest shared-date pair; the run length needs real history behind it).

DECOMPOSITION-RESIDUAL TOLERANCE (JUDGMENT CALL 11, the one contradiction
this composer ships): the 10-year nominal yield, 10-year real (TIPS) yield,
and 10-year breakeven inflation rate are three SEPARATELY-interpolated FRED
constant-maturity curves, not three legs of one single calculation -- so
``nominal - (real + breakeven)`` rarely equals exactly zero even on a shared
date, and a small nonzero residual is NORMAL, not a data error. The
``_DECOMPOSITION_RESIDUAL_TOLERANCE_PCT_PTS`` band (0.15 percentage points,
~15bp) is a disclosed composer judgment call sized to that normal
interpolation-noise reality -- never a percentile/z-score this composer has
no historical residual distribution to calibrate honestly (mirrors
``housing.py``'s ``_HOME_PRICE_RENT_FLAT_BAND_PCT`` / ``national_debt.py``'s
flat-band precedent). A residual beyond the band is a genuine, owner-native
disagreement: the market's own curve data disagreeing with its own identity,
not a threshold this composer invents beyond the disclosed band.

CORRIDOR SPREADS IN BASIS POINTS (JUDGMENT CALL 12): ``EFFR-IORB``,
``SOFR-EFFR``, and ``SOFR-IORB`` are published in basis points, never
percent, following this exact estate's own convention for these exact spreads
(``config.yml``'s ``plumbing.sofr_iorb_stress_bp`` / ``repo_spike_bp``), never
rescaled back to percent and never mixed with a percent-denominated level in
one derived read.

REGISTRY DEPENDENCY (JUDGMENT CALL 13, disclosed for the orchestrator, never
silently patched here): this composer emits ``workspace.id="rates_curves"``,
which ``engine.market_os.macro_workspaces.registry.WORKSPACE_IDS`` already
lists (the 2026-09-04 expansion append) -- and, VERIFIED at authoring time by
re-reading the committed schema, ``contracts/market_os/
macro_workspace_snapshot.v1.schema.json``'s own ``$defs.workspaceId`` enum
ALSO already includes ``"rates_curves"`` (widened in the same 2026-09-04
expansion as the schema's ``axis_id`` pattern-widening), so ``contract.
validate()`` accepts a real snapshot from this composer with no companion
schema PR needed. What ``registry.py`` does NOT yet carry is a dedicated
``REGISTRY["rates_curves"]`` entry (title/subtitle/producer/
required_components) -- it falls through to that module's own
``_NOT_BUILT`` default, so ``registry.built_ids()`` will not route
``build_all()`` to this composer until that entry is added. Adding it is out
of scope for this composer (a write-only, two-file mandate); the recommended
entry is returned as part of this hand-off instead of silently added here.

ONE-MONTH-VECTOR PRECEDENT CHOICE (JUDGMENT CALL 14): ``consumer_payments.py``
documents a "refusal outranks warmup" precedence for its own
``one_month_vector.null_reason`` because ITS headline quadrant is genuinely
COMPUTABLE once its pending series populate (so a real "computable but no
prior print yet" case exists there). Rates & Curves has no quadrant at all,
ever -- there is no computable case to distinguish from a data-refused case --
so this composer follows ``monetary_policy.py``'s SIMPLER fixed pattern
instead (both ``nearest_boundary.null_reason`` and ``one_month_vector.
null_reason`` are unconditionally the same design-absence value as
``headline.null_reason``), a disclosed rejection of the more complex
precedent rather than an oversight.

NO rank/gate/size/trade authority. NO LLM-originated facts. Descriptive
ceiling only. Depends only on the standard library (no pandas import here --
the caller supplies plain rows so this module stays testable without
pandas). The composer NEVER reads a wall clock: ``built_at`` is supplied by
the caller, and every staleness/age/lookback/same-date check is a pure
function of ``built_at`` and the given rows, so an identical set of owner
inputs always yields an identical snapshot body.
