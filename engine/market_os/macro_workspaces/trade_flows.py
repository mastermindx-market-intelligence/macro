"""Pure composer for the US ``trade_flows`` workspace snapshot (beyond-F01
expansion, Chairman-authorized 2026-09-04 -- the SECOND workspace past the
frozen twelve-workspace Market Ontology architecture set, reaching toward the
reference product's fourteen-workspace taxonomy alongside ``rates_curves``).

Reads FIVE raw, ALREADY-LOADED level series -- all FRED parquet series -- and
projects them into a ``mastermind.macro_workspace_snapshot.v1`` body:

* ``fred_frames`` -- a dict ``{series_id: rows_or_None}`` where ``rows`` is a
  plain Python list of ``(date, value)`` pairs (or longer tuples -- extra
  elements are ignored, mirrors ``housing.py``'s / ``rates_curves.py``'s
  unconsumed-field negative control) read from ``data/fred/<series_id>.parquet``,
  ascending. Exactly FIVE series are consumed (column names per the
  orchestrator's same-commit ``config.yml`` append, ``build.py``'s
  ``_TRADE_FRED_COLUMNS``); any OTHER key in ``fred_frames`` is ignored -- this
  composer never iterates the dict blindly, only ever reads the five series ids
  it names below:

    BOPGSTB -> trade_balance_goods_services  Trade Balance: Goods and Services,
        BoP Basis ($ MILLIONS, SA, monthly, period-start dated; negative =
        deficit; released by Census/BEA's joint FT-900 report)
    BOPTEXP -> exports_goods_services  Exports of Goods and Services, BoP Basis
        ($M SA monthly, period-start dated, FT-900)
    BOPTIMP -> imports_goods_services  Imports of Goods and Services, BoP Basis
        ($M SA monthly, period-start dated, FT-900)
    IR -> import_price_index  Import Price Index, All Commodities (index, NSA,
        monthly, period-start dated, BLS)
    IQ -> export_price_index  Export Price Index, All Commodities (index, NSA,
        monthly, period-start dated, BLS)

DISK TRUTH TODAY (2026-09-04, verified via a live glob during authoring, no
shell): NONE of the five parquets exist -- ``data/fred/BOPGSTB.parquet``,
``BOPTEXP.parquet``, ``BOPTIMP.parquet``, ``IR.parquet``, ``IQ.parquet`` are
all absent, and ``data/china_trade_detail/`` (a different owner's lane, see
below) does not exist either. This is the EXTREME case of
``consumer_payments.py``'s self-heal pattern: where Consumer & Payments ships
with two of nine series already collected, Trade Flows ships with ZERO of five
collected -- every frame is ``None`` on the real first build. The
orchestrator's ``config.yml`` ``fred.series.trade_flows:`` group (this exact
five-id/column map) lands in the SAME commit as this composer; the nightly
KEYLESS collector materializes the five parquets within a day. Every derived
read below is a pure function of whatever rows are handed in -- there is no
hardcoded "still early" branch anywhere in this module, so the snapshot
self-heals the instant real rows appear, exactly like every other typed-absent
leg in this estate.

REGISTRY / SCHEMA DEPENDENCY (disclosed, verified during authoring, mirrors
``rates_curves.py``'s own JUDGMENT CALL 13): ``engine.market_os.macro_workspaces
.registry.WORKSPACE_IDS`` already lists ``"trade_flows"`` (the 2026-09-04
expansion append, immediately after ``"rates_curves"``), and
``contracts/market_os/macro_workspace_snapshot.v1.schema.json``'s own
``$defs.workspaceId`` enum ALSO already includes ``"trade_flows"`` -- checked
directly against the committed schema file at authoring time, not assumed --
so ``contract.validate()`` accepts a real snapshot from this composer with no
companion schema PR needed. ``engine.market_os.macro_workspaces.build.py`` is
ALREADY wired end-to-end for this workspace: it imports ``trade_flows``,
routes ``workspace_id == "trade_flows"`` to ``trade_flows.compose(
trade_fred_frames, built_at=..., prior_snapshot=..., code_version=...)``, and
its own ``_TRADE_FRED_COLUMNS`` dict already matches the five ids/columns
above verbatim -- this composer's ``compose()`` signature was cross-checked
against that live call site, not merely against the hand-off spec. What
``registry.py`` does NOT yet carry is a dedicated ``REGISTRY["trade_flows"]``
entry (title/subtitle/producer/required_components) -- it falls through to
that module's own ``_NOT_BUILT`` default, so ``registry.built_ids()`` will not
route ``build_all()`` to this composer until that entry is added. Adding it is
out of scope for this composer (a write-only, two-file mandate); the
recommended entry is returned as part of this hand-off instead of silently
added here.

REQUIRED-ONLY, NO OPTIONAL SPLIT (JUDGMENT CALL 1 -- a deliberate departure
from ``consumer_payments.py``'s 2-required/7-optional split and
``rates_curves.py``'s 14-required/5-optional split): all FIVE series are
REQUIRED. With zero series collected today, an honest first build reads
``availability.state = SOURCE_FAILED`` and ``coverage_ratio = 0.0`` across the
board -- this is the intended, designed signal for a workspace whose entire
composable core is still pending collection, not a failure state to soften
with an optional-legs escape hatch the way Consumer's seven pending legs (out
of nine) were kept optional because two OTHER legs were already live.

SA / NSA NEVER-MIX LAW (JUDGMENT CALL 2): ``BOPGSTB``/``BOPTEXP``/``BOPTIMP``
are seasonally adjusted (SA) dollar flows, in USD MILLIONS; ``IR``/``IQ`` are
NOT seasonally adjusted (NSA) price indexes. ``terms_of_trade_proxy`` (IQ/IR)
combines the two NSA series only -- clean, but disclosed explicitly since it
is the one non-obvious same-basis pairing on this page. Every OTHER derived
read (``export_import_coverage_ratio``, ``trade_balance_share_of_flows_pct``,
``trade_balance_identity_residual``) combines only the three SA dollar-flow
series. Verified by construction: grep every ``_pair_value``/``_triple_value``
call below -- none ever crosses the SA/NSA boundary.

$M UNIT DISCIPLINE (JUDGMENT CALL 3): every dollar-flow metric is published in
USD MILLIONS (``usd_millions_sa``), FRED's own native scale for
BOPGSTB/BOPTEXP/BOPTIMP, and is NEVER rescaled to $bn (unlike, e.g.,
``consumer_payments.py``'s G.19 series, which are natively $bn) -- a scale
this composer never mixes with any $bn read from another workspace.

TRADE-BALANCE YOY IS A LEVEL CHANGE, NEVER A PERCENT (JUDGMENT CALL 4):
``trade_balance_yoy_change`` is the level DIFFERENCE (current minus year-ago),
in $M, never a percent-change. BOPGSTB crosses zero (a trade balance can flip
from deficit to surplus, and frequently sits near zero relative to its own
swings), so a percent YoY is mathematically unstable near a zero or
sign-flipping denominator. Every OTHER level series here (exports, imports,
both price indexes) never crosses zero in practice, so those legitimately use
a genuine percent YoY instead.

3-MONTH AVERAGE IS WINDOW-BASED, NEVER "THE LAST THREE ROWS BLINDLY"
(JUDGMENT CALL 5): ``trade_balance_avg_3m`` requires at least THREE
observations inside a disclosed ``[latest_date - 65 days, latest_date]``
window before publishing an average (65d = ~61d for three consecutive
30-31-day months + 4d slack for month-length variance), refusing
``INSUFFICIENT_HISTORY`` otherwise. A window-based floor keeps a collection
gap from silently reaching back across a large outage to stitch three
non-consecutive prints together under one "3-month average" label.

SAME-DATE DISCIPLINE, GENERALIZED TO MONTHLY CADENCE (JUDGMENT CALL 6,
``rates_curves.py`` precedent): ``export_import_coverage_ratio``,
``terms_of_trade_proxy``, ``trade_balance_share_of_flows_pct``, and
``trade_balance_identity_residual`` are each computed only from the LATEST
date common to every leg they combine, refusing (``COMPUTATION_REFUSED``)
when that shared date lags any leg's own newest print by more than the
disclosed ``_SAME_DATE_STALENESS_BOUND_DAYS`` (20 -- reused from
``housing.py``/``consumer_payments.py``'s own monthly lookback-slack constant,
since these are MONTHLY, not daily, series; ``rates_curves.py``'s 5-day daily
bound would be far too tight here and would spuriously refuse a perfectly
healthy monthly same-month pairing).

ESTATE PROPAGATION LAW (JUDGMENT CALL 7, housing/consumer_payments/
rates_curves precedent): an absent leg in any paired/triple read propagates
``SOURCE_FAILED`` -- the read failed because a source failed.
``COMPUTATION_REFUSED`` is reserved for legs that are ALL present but share no
sufficiently fresh common date (the same-date-discipline law above).

THE ONE CONTRADICTION THIS COMPOSER SHIPS (JUDGMENT CALL 8):
``trade_balance_identity_residual`` (``BOPGSTB`` minus (``BOPTEXP`` minus
``BOPTIMP``)) is a genuine, defensible internal-consistency check, NOT the
dollar-flows-vs-price-indexes divergence the hand-off's own domain brief
raised and this composer REJECTS as a contradiction: nominal imports rising
while import prices fall sharply is a real economic INSIGHT (a real-volume
surge), never a data disagreement, and forcing it into ``contradiction`` would
mislabel a genuine signal as a data-quality problem -- so this composer emits
NO detector for that pattern (it is surfaced, when both legs are present, as
a plain descriptive implication instead, never as ``contradiction.present``).
The identity residual is different in kind from ``rates_curves.py``'s own
nominal/real/breakeven residual (three SEPARATELY-interpolated curves, where
a nonzero residual is NORMAL): ``BOPGSTB`` is DEFINED as ``BOPTEXP`` minus
``BOPTIMP`` by the very same BEA/Census FT-900 release, so a real disagreement
here -- beyond the disclosed ``_IDENTITY_RESIDUAL_TOLERANCE_USD_M`` ($100M)
band that absorbs ordinary rounding -- signals an actual per-series
revision-vintage mismatch between FRED's three independently-refreshed
series, a genuine owner-native data-integrity read.

NOT_COVERED REMAINDER, FOUR NAMED LANES, NEVER ESTIMATED (JUDGMENT CALL 9):
* Bilateral / country-level trade detail: a China-side GACC (Customs) partner-
  country breakdown collector is real and nightly-wired in this estate
  (``collectors/china_trade_detail.py`` -> ``data/china_trade_detail/``), but
  its own docstring frames it as "CONTEXT / DISPLAY TIER ONLY. Nothing here is
  scored, ranked, sized or promoted" for its owning surface (the CN board) --
  reusing its partner-country breakdown under a DIFFERENT workspace's
  projection is a cross-workspace scope/rights decision this composer has no
  standing to make on its own authority. Typed ``NOT_COVERED``, not silently
  read.
* Petroleum-specific trade flows: EIA weekly crude oil import/export series
  (``config.yml``'s ``eia:`` group, ``WCEIMUS2``/``WCREXUS2``, surfaced as a
  SUPPLY read on the energy/oil page's Commodity Vector) exist in-tree but
  belong to the energy-plumbing owner's lane, not this one. Typed
  ``NOT_COVERED``.
* Customs / tariff receipts: no collector for this release exists anywhere in
  this estate. Typed ``NOT_COVERED``.
* Services-only or goods-only trade detail: ``BOPGSTB``/``BOPTEXP``/
  ``BOPTIMP`` are the COMBINED goods-AND-services read; no finer goods-only or
  services-only breakdown is collected. Typed ``NOT_COVERED``.
None of the four is ever estimated from a different series, and none is
``RIGHTS_BLOCKED`` (unlike ``consumer_payments.py``'s card-network panels) --
each is a genuine scope gap (no collector wired for THIS workspace's
projection), never a rights barrier.

HEADLINE: UNCONDITIONALLY NOT_APPLICABLE (JUDGMENT CALL 10, ``rates_curves.py``
/ ``monetary_policy.py`` precedent, NOT ``consumer_payments.py``'s/
``housing.py``'s data-refusal precedent): Trade Flows is a Chairman-authorized
expansion workspace with no architecture-document section defining a headline
blueprint at all -- there is no named axis pair here to attempt, computable or
not, so ``axes.items`` stays ``[]`` (schema-legal) and the null is a DESIGN
ABSENCE, never a per-build ``COMPUTATION_REFUSED``. This holds regardless of
data completeness: even a fully self-healed, all-``CURRENT`` build still
carries the same ``NOT_APPLICABLE`` null.

ONE-MONTH-VECTOR / NEAREST-BOUNDARY: THE SIMPLER FIXED PATTERN (JUDGMENT
CALL 11, a disclosed departure from ``consumer_payments.py``'s "refusal
outranks warmup" precedent): both ``nearest_boundary.null_reason`` and
``one_month_vector.null_reason`` unconditionally carry the SAME
``NOT_APPLICABLE`` value as ``headline.null_reason`` itself, exactly
mirroring ``rates_curves.py``'s own JUDGMENT CALL 14. Consumer's more complex
precedent exists ONLY for a workspace whose headline quadrant IS genuinely
computable once its pending legs populate (so a real "computable-but-no-
prior-print" case exists to distinguish from a data-refused case); Trade
Flows, like Rates & Curves, never has a computable quadrant at all, so there
is no such case for the more complex precedent to apply to here.

DRIVERS BUCKET REUSE (JUDGMENT CALL 12, disclosed, mirrors every sibling):
the contract's ``drivers`` block is closed to exactly ``{rate_side,
balance_sheet}``. ``balance_sheet`` carries the dollar-flow legs (trade
balance, exports, imports, the coverage ratio, the balance-share-of-flows
read, the identity residual) -- a loose thematic fit (these ARE about a
"balance"), not a literal monetary balance sheet. ``rate_side`` carries the
two price-index legs and the terms-of-trade proxy -- pure bucket-naming
convenience, never a claim these are policy rates. Disclosed in the
``driver_bucket_naming_note`` implication, never left implicit.

PIT / REVISION LAW (JUDGMENT CALL 13): no ALFRED point-in-time vintage capture
exists for any of the five series today. Every level and derived read below
is therefore the LATEST-REVISED value as currently stored, never an "as it
was known then" reconstruction (housing/consumer_payments/rates_curves
precedent) -- FT-900 dollar flows and BLS price indexes are both revised for
months after first release.

UNVERIFIED INDEX BASE YEAR (JUDGMENT CALL 14, mirrors
``consumer_payments.py``'s DSPIC96 judgment call 15): ``IR``/``IQ``'s index
base year (BLS conventionally bases these near 2000=100, but this composer
cannot execute code to inspect the parquet's own embedded metadata in this
authoring environment -- no shell) is disclosed generically ("index, NSA,
base year per BLS/FRED series metadata") in each metric's own transformation
text, never asserted as a specific unverified base year.

FRESHNESS (worst-case-age law, hand-traced against "a maximally-fresh print
must read CURRENT throughout the publication cycle" -- the same law every
sibling composer derives its cadence constants from):
* BOPGSTB/BOPTEXP/BOPTIMP: the Census/BEA FT-900 report is released
  approximately 35-40 days after the reference MONTH END. FRED dates the
  series period-START, so the worst case (a 31-day reference month, released
  at the 40-day-after-month-end edge of the window) puts the lag-at-release at
  31 + 40 = 71 days from the period-start date; add one further ~31-day
  release cycle (the newest-possible age right before the NEXT month's print
  supersedes it) -> cadence 71 + 31 = 102 days. Grace 17 days (the Census-
  family shutdown-precedent grace this estate already uses for
  HOUST/PERMIT/RSAFS).
* IR/IQ: BLS releases these import/export price indexes around the second
  week of the following month, worst case landing as late as day ~18 of M+1;
  from a period-start date that is a lag of 31 (reference month length) + 18
  = 49 days at release; add one further ~31-day cycle -> cadence
  49 + 31 = 80 days. Grace 15 days (the construction-class grace this estate
  already uses for Case-Shiller / UMCSENT-style monthly releases).
Both hand-checks satisfy the maximally-fresh-print law: a print sitting at
exactly its cadence's age (the newest-possible print, one instant before the
next release supersedes it) reads ``CURRENT``, never falsely ``STALE_SOURCE``.

NO rank/gate/size/trade authority. NO LLM-originated facts. Descriptive
ceiling only. Depends only on the standard library (no pandas import here --
the caller supplies plain rows). The composer NEVER reads a wall clock:
``built_at`` is supplied by the caller, and every staleness/age/lookback/
same-date check is a pure function of ``built_at`` and the given rows, so an
identical set of owner inputs always yields an identical snapshot body.
