"""engine/output_health.py — the output-level health contract (Eval OS T4).

WHAT THIS ANSWERS, AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO ANSWER
------------------------------------------------
Per engine OUTPUT (one synapse artifact): healthy / degraded / stale / unavailable — or
that Eval OS could not determine the answer at all. The fourth answer is the point of the
module. PRODUCER HEALTH != OUTPUT HEALTH != READER HEALTH: a producer whose nightly job
went green can still be shipping a frozen file, and a file whose watermark is current can
still be stale in the copy a paying reader actually receives. Three planes, three
verdicts, and this module joins them under ONE precedence order instead of letting each
caller invent its own.

"I could not look" NEVER renders as "I looked and it was clean" (CLAUDE.md §Epistemics).
:data:`BLIND_REASONS` is that law as data: any of those reasons on an output's OWN core
evidence short-circuits to ``state=None, assessment_status='could_not_look'``, and no
later rule can convert that into ``healthy`` or ``unavailable``. An unreadable artifact
and a deleted artifact are different facts; the whole value of this layer is refusing to
collapse them.

A JOINING LAYER, NOT ANOTHER MONITOR
------------------------------------
Nothing here monitors anything. It reads already-existing evidence — the synapse census,
the T1 engine registry, a presence/watermark observation per artifact, the reader plane
(freshness sentinel + R2 audit), semantic self-health (Neural Web lobes, foresight legs)
and provider telemetry — and normalizes them. It builds no registry, keeps no dependency
graph of its own, holds no dead-man switch and COMMITS NOTHING. There is therefore no
T4 fixed point: this module's output is not a synapse artifact and cannot grade itself.

PURE. NO I/O, NO CLOCK, NO ENVIRONMENT
--------------------------------------
Every read, every probe and every wall-clock reading happens in
``scripts/build_output_health.py`` (or in the admin layer) and arrives here as an
argument. ``now`` is INJECTED and must be tz-aware — :func:`lib.dataos.temporal.utc`
refuses a naive datetime rather than guessing a zone, which is the same refusal the rest
of the estate makes. Same inputs -> byte-identical output; every list is sorted.

NO SCORES, NO RANKS, NO PROMOTION
---------------------------------
The record carries no score, weight, rank, promotion state or authority MUTATION. It
reports T1's ``artifact_authority`` and ``output_class`` verbatim and mutates neither. No
field here is a model input; health is an operating fact about a file, never a signal.

THE TIME-BASIS LAW (§5 of the commission)
-----------------------------------------
The governing watermark field is ``staleness_from`` when declared, else ``asof_field`` —
and the value is read from THAT FIELD ONLY. An observation naming a different field is
REFUSED (:data:`REASON_WATERMARK_FIELD_MISMATCH`), because a silent fallback to whatever
timestamp the file happens to carry is how a frozen store reads fresh forever. A promised
field that is absent from the content is blindness, not freshness.

DATE-ONLY WATERMARKS RESOLVE ONE WAY ONLY. ``2026-08-14`` is read at its most conservative
instant (end of that date, 00:00 UTC the next day). Inside SLA that is enough to prove
CURRENT. Beyond SLA it proves nothing: distinguishing a weekend/holiday lag from an
outage needs a declared calendar, synapse has no ``freshness_calendar`` field, and
inferring one from a ticker or a program name is a guess. So it returns
``date_only_calendar_unknown`` and could_not_look — deliberately NOT the weekend-aware
rule ``engine/neuralweb/health.py`` applies to its own rollup.

THE READER PLANE OUTRANKS THE PRODUCER (§8) — BUT IT NEVER CLEARS BLINDNESS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A definitive CONTENT-clock reader verdict of stale/missing overrides any producer-side
current-ness, because the reader copy is what consumers actually receive. Clock kind is
adjudicated by CONTRACT, not by newest timestamp: content-clock evidence outranks
transport-clock evidence in BOTH directions — a fresh ``Last-Modified`` never rescues a
stale content watermark, and a stale transport stamp never overrides a definitively fresh
reader content watermark. A transport-clock verdict decides only where no content clock
exists at all.

TWO REFUSALS BOUND THAT OVERRIDE, AND BOTH ARE THE SAME LAW AS THE PRODUCER SIDE'S:

1. BLINDNESS IS ESTABLISHED BEFORE THE FOLD AND A FRESH READER NEVER CLEARS IT. The
   producer-side read runs first; if the artifact's OWN evidence was unreadable
   (:data:`FRESH_BLIND` — field mismatch, promised field absent, parse error, unparseable
   or date-only-beyond-SLA) that blindness is recorded before any reader row is consulted,
   and no reader verdict of ``fresh`` can convert it into ``healthy``. A reader may fill
   an UNASSESSED axis (:data:`FRESH_UNASSESSABLE` — the write-time contract with no
   trusted mtime); it may not fill a BLIND one. The two are different answers: "not
   measured" versus "measured and unreadable", and only the first is a gap a second
   observer can close.

   TWO CARVE-OUTS, BOTH ASYMMETRIC ON PURPOSE, because a negative and a rescue are not
   the same claim:

   (A) A DEFINITIVE READER NEGATIVE DECIDES ANYWAY. A field-matching content-clock
       ``stale``, or a ``missing`` from a reader that went and looked for this object,
       is a complete observation of a real defect on its own axis — the same logic that
       already lets a definitive negative resolve state under a ``partial`` assessment.
       The state is ``stale``/``unavailable`` with ``decided_by='reader'``, the producer
       blindness reasons STAY on the record, and the assessment stays ``partial``.
       Suppressing that to ``could_not_look`` would hide a proven defect behind a
       question about a different plane.
   (B) FOR A PURE-``r2`` ARTIFACT THE READER IS THE PRIMARY PLANE. Nothing local exists
       to be blind about, so a field-matching content-clock observation is not a rescue —
       it is the only plane that can answer, and it completes the freshness axis in both
       directions (:data:`REASON_R2_READER_PRIMARY_PLANE`, and the local-plane reasons in
       :data:`R2_LOCAL_PLANE_BLINDNESS` are superseded). ``git+r2`` is excluded: a git
       copy exists, so a fresh reader there is a rescue and only (A) gets through.
2. A CONTENT-CLOCK READER MUST NAME THE FIELD IT MEASURED. ``asof_field`` is REQUIRED on
   a content-clock row whose verdict is fresh/stale; a row naming a different field than
   the artifact declares — the live shape is the freshness sentinel reading
   ``source_asof`` out of a ``prophet/index.json`` whose declared watermark is ``asof`` —
   is DOWNGRADED to diagnostic evidence with :data:`REASON_READER_FIELD_MISMATCH`, and a
   row naming no field at all with :data:`REASON_READER_FIELD_UNDECLARED`. It ranks and
   reads as transport-equivalent: disclosed, but deciding nothing. Otherwise the reader
   plane would be a silent-fallback hole in exactly the law §5 closes on the producer
   plane — a different timestamp standing in for the declared one.

``source_asof`` IS THE DECLARED FIELD'S VALUE, READ FROM THE PRODUCER, OR NULL. It is
never back-filled from a reader's ``observed_asof``: a record whose watermark column
silently switches planes cannot be compared with itself over time. Where a reader decides
the state its own asof is disclosed as an EVIDENCE row instead.

DEPENDENCY BOUNDS ARE UPPER UNLESS PROVEN EXACT (§6)
----------------------------------------------------
Direct inputs are inferred mechanically: B is an input of A when A's producer appears in
B's ``consumers``. That inversion is EXACT only when A's producer registers exactly one
artifact; for a multi-output producer the inputs of all its outputs fold together, so the
bound is ``upper``. ``engine/neuralweb/support_map.py``'s ``_UPSTREAM_NOTE`` claims
upstream traversal is always exact — that claim does not hold for multi-output producers
(136 of 365 live producers, covering 412 of 642 artifacts), so this module computes its
own bound rather than inheriting it.

A self-loop (a producer that lists itself among its own artifact's consumers — 120 live
cases) is EXCLUDED from that artifact's inputs: reading your own prior vintage is not a
freshness gate on yourself.

    Parameters
    ----------
    synapse
        Parsed ``config/synapse.yml`` (the artifact census: path, producer, consumers,
        storage, asof_field, staleness_from, freshness_sla_hours, notes).
    registry
        The T1 view from ``scripts/build_intelligence_registry.build()`` — supplies
        ``engine_id``, the curated ``output_class`` overlay and ``artifact_authority``.
        An artifact in synapse but in no T1 engine cell keeps a record with
        ``engine_id: null`` and :data:`REASON_NOT_IN_ENGINE_REGISTRY`; nothing is dropped
        and no cell is invented.
    observations
        Per artifact: ``exists`` (bool | None — None means COULD NOT DETERMINE),
        ``presence_source`` ('filesystem' | 'git_head' | 'declared' | None),
        ``content_asof_raw``, ``asof_field_present``, ``watermark_field_used``,
        ``mtime_utc``, ``mtime_trusted``, ``parse_error``, ``sparse_unmaterialized``.
    reader_observations
        Per artifact, one mapping or a sequence of them:
        ``{source, verdict, clock_kind, asof_field?, observed_asof?, detail?}``.
        ``asof_field`` is REQUIRED on a content-clock row whose verdict is ``fresh`` or
        ``stale`` — it names the field the reader actually measured. A row that names a
        different field than the artifact declares, or none at all, is downgraded to
        transport-equivalent diagnostic evidence and decides nothing (§8).
    self_health
        Per artifact ``{source, status, detail?, source_artifact?}`` with ``status``
        already normalized to ok | degraded | missing | unknown. ``source_artifact`` names
        the artifact the evidence was DERIVED FROM; when its producer is the graded
        artifact's own producer the entry is REFUSED
        (:data:`REASON_SELF_MONITOR_NO_SELF_EVIDENCE`) — a monitor may not grade its own
        outputs, and deriving that mechanically beats a hand list of health artifacts.
    provider_events
        Per artifact, provider-waterfall rows. DIAGNOSTIC ONLY: a failed rung followed by
        a successful fallback describes the call, not the output, and never changes state.
    optional_upstream_overrides
        The RESOLVED view of the synapse ``health_optional_upstreams`` field — a whole
        replacement, not a patch: when it is passed, an artifact absent from it has no
        optional inputs regardless of what its own entry declares. Omit it (the default)
        to read the field off each artifact's entry.
    now
        Tz-aware; a naive datetime raises :class:`lib.dataos.temporal.TemporalError`.
