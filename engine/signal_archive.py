"""Append-only archive of the daily MODEL-OUTPUT snapshots (the "signal layer").

Every engine run OVERWRITES data/<mkt>/latest.json (and bond_health.json,
regime_snap.json, forex/commodity latest.json, ...) with TODAY's read. Those
overwrites are recoverable only via the daily git commit — inconvenient — and
regime_history.parquet is RECOMPUTED from scratch each run (so it carries data
revisions + today's engine code backwards), which means neither is a faithful
point-in-time record of what the model actually SAID on a given day.

This module keeps a clean, append-only, point-in-time copy keyed by as-of date in
ONE columnar file per label — data/signal_archive/<label>.parquet — with:

  - asof / logged_at        the point-in-time keys
  - <flattened scalars>     every scalar leaf of the snapshot, dot-flattened to
                            columns (quad, growth_score, macro_risk_score, ...) so
                            the signal time series is queryable without parsing
  - snapshot_json           the FULL snapshot as a JSON string — LOSSLESS, so the
                            lists the flat columns drop (sector_rs, playbook,
                            alerts) are always recoverable

Columnar compression makes this cheap (~1.8 KB/row amortized even at 500+ cols,
because slow-moving daily values and the near-identical snapshot_json blob both
compress hard) — the same daily-rewritten-parquet pattern lib/store.py already
uses for every price series, so it is the codebase-native choice.

Keep-FIRST per as-of date: the first publish for a date is the honest record of
what was shown at the time; same-day re-runs and stale (failed-build) files dedup
to a no-op. Best-effort and DISPLAY/RESEARCH-only: never read back into any score,
never breaks a build. It is the safety net while signal definitions are still in
flux — snapshot_json survives definition drift, and because the file is committed
in the same daily commit, each row's git commit is its model-version fingerprint
(provenance for free).

Scale lever (only once a label is years long): partition the filename by year
(<label>/<year>.parquet) so closed years stop being rewritten daily. Trivial later
— the store is keyed by asof, so a one-time split is lossless.

Mirrors the append_log() convention in engine/market_drivers.py.
