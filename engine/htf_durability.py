"""HTF momentum DURABILITY engine — front-running secular tops & bottoms.

Display / context tier. De-escalation authority only. Never originates buy/sell.
PRIMARY use: top-side de-escalation (BOTTOM-SETUP is display-tier context that
accrues and never upgrades risk-on; BOTTOM-SETUP requires real stack support).
Additive dict output — caller passes into the regime read; does NOT mutate it.

Design (approved multi-team-adversarial synthesis, 2026-07-08):
  P0 — per-market monthly/2W/weekly indicator stack
  P1 — durability grading with monthly-phase veto (A–D / A′–D′)
  P2 — liquidity-card reframe (mechanical + HTF-topping -> not_momentum_confirmed)

Side resolution priority (Step 4):
  1. monthly rolling/falling => TOP
  2. monthly basing after rolling from above zero (spark_hist had positive values,
     current is negative) => TOP  [FIX 1: basing-after-rollover is still a top]
  3. monthly turning/rising/bear_recovering => BOTTOM
  4. fallback to weekly direction for genuine basing (never above zero) / unknown

Stack scoring (Step 4, FIX 3):
  Score ONLY the resolved side — do not mix opposing-side hooks. This prevents a
  situation where a single TF satisfies both macd_curl_up and macd_approaching_dn,
  causing an incoherent net stack that conflicts with the regime label.

BOTTOM-SETUP contract (FIX 4):
  Requires grade A or B AND stack_score > 0 (real bottom-side hook stack present).
  The bottom-caller is display-tier context that accrues forward outcomes; it NEVER
  originates a risk-on upgrade. Leading signal is always the TOP/de-escalation side.

Anti-patterns explicitly forbidden:
  - MACD hist zero-cross as a trigger (banned; tracked as telemetry only)
  - resample("2W-FRI") for biweekly bars (calendar-anchored drift; replaced by
    paired-weekly-bar grouping against a FIXED epoch anchor)
  - Percentile-guard on StochRSI thresholds (lookahead; fixed bands only)
  - Any "validated" language (CI-enforced)
  - Tuning thresholds on history (all constants frozen a priori from the literature)
  - LLM involvement (zero)
  - Parallel intensity path (use engine/mtf_monitor's technical_intensity; none here)

Reused primitives (NEVER rebuilt here):
  engine/cycles.py  : mtf_snapshot, _tf_phase, rsi_divergence, macd_parts,
                      stoch_rsi, _pivots
  engine/regime.py  : liquidity_quality  (P2 reframe)

Washout organs consulted as confluence only (not re-implemented):
  engine/hk_washout_watch, engine/coiled, engine/sector_bottom

        Never required — missing keys default to False/0.
        fear_greed_extreme: when not supplied by the caller, compute() reads
        site/basketdata/fear_greed.json and derives it as dial>=80 or dial<=20
        (VSB masterplan W5). Defaults to False when the file is absent so
        behaviour is unchanged vs callers that do not supply external_organs.
    liquidity_quality_dict : dict, optional
        Output of engine/regime.liquidity_quality() — used for P2 reframe only.

    dict
        Additive, fail-open dict. Never mutates the caller's regime dict.
