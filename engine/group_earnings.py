"""Group earnings pulse — Wave GR2 of the Group Reads program
(research/GROUP_READS_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md).

AUTHORITY
=========
    schema:    group_earnings_pulse.v1
    authority: context_only

DISPLAY / CONTEXT TIER ONLY. Nothing in this module ranks, sizes, gates, alerts, or
grants entry authority, and it never fuses its legs into a cross-basket score. It is
the earnings LAYER of a basket read: where the group is in its reporting cycle, how the
prints landed, which way management is talking, whether the analyst wave is broadening,
what happened in the five sessions after the print, and — the leg nothing else here has —
whether the basket's members actually MOVE TOGETHER around each other's earnings.

Every stat carries its own n. Every floor refusal prints a null rather than a
survivor-only number. A member with no data lands in `n_no_data`; it never silently
shrinks a denominator (resolution-conditioned-denominator law). A missing input store
degrades to disclosed nulls — it never fabricates and never raises into the nightly.
An LLM consumer may de-escalate these reads; it may never originate one.

THE ARTIFACT
============
`site/basketdata/earnings_pulse.json` — a dict keyed by basket_id, one
`group_earnings_pulse.v1` object per US basket in data/baskets/membership.json, built
from the members that are LIVE as of the run date (`added` <= as_of, `removed` unset or
> as_of). The key set of every block is CONSTANT: a refused stat is null next to its
own n, never an absent key. Unknown keys are contract violations
(tests/test_group_earnings_contract.py).

                                          filing_date, acceptance_datetime, items) that
                                          the 8-quarter sympathy window needs; the Nasdaq

    data/edgar/guidance_hits.parquet      via engine.guidance_gap (imported, not forked)
    data/revisions/latest.parquet         collectors/equity_revisions.py, the same store
                                          engine.theme_revisions rolls up
    data/baskets/ohlcv/<T>.parquet        member closes (`close`, Date index)
    yahoo/SPY (lib.store)                 the benchmark close cache engine.baskets and
                                          engine.group_flow already benchmark against —
                                          `store.read("yahoo", "SPY")["close"]`

DISCLOSED RULES (deterministic and stated is what matters; each is pinned by a test)
====================================================================================
REACTION SESSION. An announcement is mapped to the session that first prices it. The
    8-K store's `acceptance_datetime` is UTC, so: accepted BEFORE 14:30 UTC -> the first
    session at-or-after that UTC date (a pre-open print moves the stock that day);
    accepted at-or-after 14:30 UTC -> the first session STRICTLY AFTER it (an after-hours
    print moves the stock the next session). 14:30 UTC is 09:30 ET under EST and 10:30 ET
    under EDT, so the rule is exact for pre-open and after-hours prints in both halves of
    the year and errs only for the rare intraday 2.02 filing during a winter morning. No
    tz database is required, which keeps the rule identical on every runner. A Nasdaq
    `reported` date carries no time; it is treated as after-hours (the modal case) unless
    an 8-K event for the same ticker sits within REPORT_MATCH_SESSIONS sessions, in which
    case the timed 8-K event wins and the Nasdaq surprise is attached to it.

SEASON. A member counts as REPORTED when its most recent reaction session falls inside
    the trailing SEASON_LOOKBACK_SESSIONS (75) sessions ending at `as_of`. 75 sessions is
    ~105 calendar days: one full quarterly cycle plus the late-reporter tail, so in a
    normal cycle exactly one report per member falls inside it. Only the LATEST report is
    ever counted, so a member on a broken cycle can read 0 but never double-counts.
    `n_upcoming_14d` counts members whose `next_date` lands in (as_of, as_of + 14 days];
    `session` is amc/bmo only when the store supplies `next_time`, else "unknown".

RESULTS. Per member, the latest-quarter Nasdaq surprise whose reaction session is inside
    the season window: beat = surprise > 0, miss = surprise < 0, inline = exactly 0.
    `surprise_pct` is preferred; when it is absent the sign of (eps - consensus) is used.
    Floor MIN_REPORTED (4) classified members, else every count nulls and n_no_data
    absorbs the whole membership. n_beat + n_miss + n_inline + n_no_data == n_members,
    always.

GUIDANCE. engine.guidance_gap's classifier is IMPORTED, never re-implemented: the same
    `_theme_guidance` rollup runs over basket members instead of curated themes, so the
    latest-direction-per-ticker resolution, the RECENT_DAYS window, and the band ladder
    are shared code. Its >=MIN_FILERS (2) distinct-filers law is preserved exactly — below
    it, this artifact prints `band: null` rather than guidance_gap's NEUTRAL, because a
    null is the honest disclosure of "too thin to call" where NEUTRAL reads as a call.

REVISIONS. engine.theme_revisions' member-rollup pattern (its MIN_ANALYSTS coverage gate
    is imported so it cannot drift): `net_up_share` is the share of covered members whose
    net-up revision breadth is positive, `n_covered` the number of members clearing the
    coverage gate. Floor MIN_COVERED (4), else null.

DRIFT. Members whose season reaction session is at least DRIFT_SESSIONS (5) sessions
    before `as_of`: the share with a positive cumulative SPY-adjusted return from the
    REACTION session's close to five sessions later — post-announcement drift measured
    after the initial gap, not through it. Floor MIN_DRIFT_N (4), else null.

SYMPATHY. The signature leg: do earnings move this basket TOGETHER? Over the trailing
    WINDOW_Q (8) quarters of member reaction sessions, pool every |SPY-adjusted same-day
    move| of the members that were NOT reporting that day (co-reporters are excluded — on
    their own report day you would be measuring their reaction, not sympathy; an event
    needs MIN_COHORT (3) such members to count). `ratio` is the median of that pooled
    event-day set divided by the SAME members' unconditional baseline median |SPY-adjusted
    move| over every session in the window that is NOT a report day for ANY member of the
    basket. Floors n_events >= 12 AND n_reporters >= 4, else the whole block nulls with
    the counts still printed. The directional split reports the median SIGNED non-reporter
    move on beat days vs miss days (by the reporter's own surprise sign), each requiring
    MIN_DIRECTIONAL_DAYS (5) event days or that half nulls on its own.

COVERAGE, MEASURED (2026-08-08, the store as committed). The 8-K spine is deep — 13+ years
    of Item-2.02 dates for a mega-cap — but the CONSENSUS half is thin: the Nasdaq surprise
    history is a budgeted drip (~120 names/run, see collectors/equity_earnings.py's ROTATION
    CONTRACT), so only 715 of 1,976 stored names, and 201 of 653 live basket members, carry
    any surprise history at all. That is why 18 of 49 baskets refuse the results block on
    this snapshot. Those members are counted in `n_no_data`, never dropped — a beat share
    computed over only the dripped members would be a survivor statistic. edgar_eps
    (data/edgar/eps_quarterly.parquet) is deliberately NOT substituted: it carries actual
    EPS with NO consensus, so anything built from it would be a different statistic wearing
    the `eps_surprise vs consensus` label. The block recovers on its own as the drip fills.

HONEST LIMITS. Sympathy is a co-movement DESCRIPTION, not a causal claim and not a trade:
    a basket whose members report in the same week will read high partly because the sector
    tape moves for reasons unrelated to any one print, and the SPY adjustment removes market
    beta but not sector beta. Beat/miss is a Nasdaq/community consensus, not official
    guidance, and dates can move. Guidance is a coarse language band with no negation
    handling. None of these are graded signals; the gauntlet applies only if any of them is
    ever proposed for authority, and nothing here is.

LEDGER. data/group_pulse/sympathy.parquet — one immutable row per (basket_id, event_date,
    reporter_ticker), appended ONLY on the nightly lane (engine.ledger_lane). Rows are
    historical facts: a later run may add new event days, never rewrite an existing one.
