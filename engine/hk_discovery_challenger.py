"""HK Lane-B discovery challenger — ``hk_discovery_v1`` (WS:PROPHET-HK-CA-REVAMP).

research/PROPHET_SHADOW_CONTRACT_V1.md §3 is the binding storage/isolation
contract; this module is the FIRST real registrant against the market-scoped
registry engine/board_shadow.py ships empty. It answers one question only:
"was this opportunity visible to the research system before it won?" — it is
NOT a ranking model, picks no winner, and computes no outcome.

MARKET-FREE BY CONSTRUCTION (K-D6): this module never takes, infers, or reads
a market. There is no market parameter anywhere in its public surface, no
environment-variable read, and no other-market token. Market ownership lives
ONLY at the registration call site (``scripts/build_hk_library.py``, which
binds this module's :data:`DEFINITION` to the literal HK market when calling
``engine.board_shadow.register_challenger``). A future second-market
registrant is a SEPARATE module registered separately — never a branch added
here.

PUBLICATION-INDEPENDENT (K-D2 / K-D9): :func:`build_candidates` consumes an
explicit ``evidence`` bundle assembled by the caller from pre-cut structures
the nightly build already computes — never board rank, never the composite
selection score's order, never which names the display board flagged for
extra attention, and never the published board artifact itself. Any of
those fields riding along in the evidence bundle (a caller's fixture is free
to include them) are simply not read by anything below — this module's
source names none of them, checked by a repo-wide source fence
(tests/test_hk_discovery_challenger.py K-D2).

ORIGIN PREDICATES (fixed canonical order — the "+"-joined
``candidate_origin`` token on every candidate row lists whichever of these
fired, always in this order):

  a. washout_reclaim   — the 2W washout/reclaim state map (``_tf_state`` on a
                         2W-FRI resample of the close panel; the SAME
                         pre-cut structure scripts/build_hk_library.py
                         already computes at ~L1328-1336, keyed by
                         ``stoch_cross_up``).
  b. leadership        — engine.hk_leadership.compute()'s own per-member
                         ``above_rising_ma10`` read, gated on the organ's own
                         ``leaders_participating`` state (the fixed mega-cap
                         cohort's population limitation is honest — this
                         module never extends the cohort).
  c. ripening          — membership in the UNCAPPED population underlying
                         engine.hk_board_rank.build_ripening_rows (the
                         caller calls that exact function a second time with
                         an expanded cap so the classifier logic is never
                         duplicated here).
  d. aged_turn         — engine.hk_board_rank.ran_admits(), called directly:
                         the UNCAPPED admission predicate underlying
                         build_ran_rows (the anchor/close-series machinery
                         build_ran_rows also does is a DISPLAY concern —
                         "can this row show an age" — not an admission
                         concern, so calling the predicate directly reaches
                         the true uncapped population).
  e. blocked_signal    — engine.hk_board_rank.veto_admits(), called
                         directly: the UNCAPPED admission predicate
                         underlying build_vetoed_rows, carrying the
                         deterministic veto reason as a sub-token, e.g.
                         ``blocked_signal(counter_trend_no_200_reclaim_hold)``.
                         Bounded by the SAME staleness measure
                         build_vetoed_rows applies (VETOED_MAX_SESSIONS, via
                         the shared engine.hk_board_rank.veto_sessions_since()
                         helper — build commission R2/F2): a veto older than
                         that bound does not fire here either. Unknown age
                         (no marker date and no fresh_bars) still fires —
                         only a KNOWN-stale veto is excluded, never an
                         unknown one.
  f. hk_native_onset   — engine.hk_southbound_stocks.signal()'s own
                         ``label == "accumulating"`` read, sub-token
                         ``hk_native_onset(southbound)``.
  g. ah_dislocation    — engine.hk_stock_signals.ah_value_signal()'s own
                         ``cheap`` read, for names WITH a resolvable A/H
                         twin only (a name absent from that map fires
                         nothing and receives no fabricated zero — K-D3).

CAP LAW: (c)/(d)/(e) reach the UNCAPPED population — either by calling the
production predicate directly (no cap parameter exists on ``ran_admits``/
``veto_admits`` at all) or by calling the production builder a second time
with an expanded ``cap=``/``ready_cap=`` (ripening), never by re-implementing
any of that logic here.

AVAILABILITY: an INDEPENDENT read (never fed by, and never feeding, the
origin predicates above) over the frozen enum {ENTRY_OPEN, WAIT_PULLBACK,
WAIT_CONFLUENCE, RAN_DONT_CHASE, RIGHTS_BLOCKED, UNAVAILABLE_DATA}, via the
fixed, fail-closed precedence ladder in :func:`_availability`.
