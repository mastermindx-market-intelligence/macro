"""engine/intelligence_registry.py — the Mastermind engine registry (Eval OS T1).

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Mastermind has four registries and none of them counts ENGINES. ``config/synapse.yml``
counts ARTIFACTS (642 of them), ``data/species/registry.json`` counts setup SPECIES (27),
``research/DO_NOT_REBUILD.md`` counts KILLS, and ``data/qledger/`` counts CLAIMS. There is
no row per *intelligence-producing capability*, so there is nothing to hang a scorecard on
(T7), nothing to roll up into a CEO view (T8), and nothing for tier routing to read (T12).

Two measured defects motivated this module (both reproduced live 2026-08-12):

  C-1  Four of the five ``tier: scored`` artifacts carry NO ``qual_ladder_ref``. Things
       holding rank/size/gate authority do not point at the prereg that earned it.

  C-2  synapse ``tier`` does not express authority over a HUMAN. ``site-us-standouts``
       (the Prophet board that orders what a paying user sees) and ``prophet-index`` are
       both ``tier: display`` — the same value a decorative chip carries.

THE UNIT OF ACCOUNT
-------------------
``engine = (producer, owner_program)``, id ``f"{producer}::{owner_program}"``.
Measured: 642 artifacts partition into 385 cells, totally and disjointly — every artifact
belongs to exactly one engine. Chosen over the alternatives after measuring homogeneity:
only 32/385 cells (8.3%) mix ``tier`` and only 8/385 (2.1%) mix ``horizon_role``.

A DERIVED ON-DEMAND VIEW — NOTHING IS COMMITTED
-----------------------------------------------
THE REGISTRY IS NOT A FILE. Two previous rounds committed a generated
``data/intelligence_registry.json`` plus a generated Markdown mirror and pinned them by
equality against a "stable" input. Both pins were scheduled fleet-wide reds, because there
is no stable input to pin against — measured on FULL HISTORY 2026-08-14 (unshallowed
clone, 11,971 commits reachable; the 2026-08-12 figures below in brackets came off a
SHALLOW clone and understated every one of them):

  * ``config/synapse.yml``        69 commits in the trailing 14 days   [read as 26]
  * ``data/qledger/claims.jsonl`` 70 commits in the trailing 14 days   [read as 13]
  * ``data/species/registry.json`` 1 commit in the trailing 14 days, 17 in its whole
    history [read as 1 ever]. Round 2 treated "one commit ever" as stability and was wrong
    twice over: the count was a shallow-clone artifact, AND low churn is not the property a
    pin needs — every one of those 17 is an ADJUDICATION, which rewrites exactly the rows a
    registry derives from.

So nothing generated is committed, there is no drift guard, no ``--check`` equality mode,
and no stable-vs-volatile field split (that split existed ONLY to make a pin safe).
Consumers — T7's scorecard, T8's CEO view, T12's tier routing — call
:func:`build_registry` and get the view in memory, or run
``scripts/build_intelligence_registry.py --json`` and read it off stdout. Corpus-derived
fields are simply present in the view; nothing pins them, so nothing reds.

DERIVED, NOT AUTHORED (``DNR:KILL-PARALLEL-KNOWLEDGE-BASE``)
-------------------------------------------------------------
The spine is a pure function of canonical sources: ``config/synapse.yml``, an AST scan of
producer source, ``config/qual_ladder.yml``, ``data/species/`` and ``data/qledger/``. A
hand-authored engine list is the KILLED pattern. Only three fields are curated, each
because no canonical source encodes them, and they live in a four-key overlay whose key
allowlist is enforced mechanically by ``scripts/check_intelligence_registry.py`` — that
allowlist IS the executable form of the DNR row.

``authority`` and ``evidence_ref`` are NOT curated, against the recommendation of three
census reports. ``_REQUIRED_ARTIFACT_KEYS`` (engine/neuralweb/synapse.py:52) is a
required-key set, not an exact-key set, so a hand-typed ``authority:`` key in synapse.yml
would land as unenforced free text — reproducing the exact defect class C-1 and C-2 are
instances of, one field later.

KNOWN LIMIT — ``graded_by_design`` IS A WEAK HEURISTIC, AND SAYS SO
-------------------------------------------------------------------
``graded_by_design: "yes"`` means "the ledger waterfall resolved a store-shaped path", and
TWO of the four waterfall rules resolve that path from a PATH SUBSTRING: rule 1 accepts any
artifact path matching ``/ledger/i`` ANYWHERE IN THE PATH — directory component included —
and rule 4 hops to a same-program consumer whose module name matches ``/grade|ledger/i``. A
name is not proof that graded rows are written, so every ``yes`` reached that way is a
GUESS, and some of those guesses are wrong on live rows.

The disclosure used to say FILENAME, and that was measurably false: 5 of the 35 live rule-1
matches (2026-08-14) carry ``ledger`` only in a DIRECTORY component, and all 5 are real
grading stores — see :func:`_cell_ledger_paths`, which records the measurement. Tightening
the match to the basename was therefore REJECTED (it would have gone blind on five true
positives); the fix was to state what the rule actually matches.

This module does not hide that and does not hand-maintain a list of the wrong ones (a
hand list rots). Every engine carries ``graded_by_design_evidence``:

  ``strong``              — rule 2 (the producer statically imports ``engine.qledger`` and
                            a desk literal resolves by AST) or rule 3 (an artifact declares
                            tier shadow/scored/confirmer, which synapse's own
                            ``meta.tier_vocabulary`` defines as claim-registered and
                            graded).
  ``weak_path_heuristic`` — rule 1 or rule 4. The claim rests on a path/module NAME.
  ``none``                — no ledger resolved; the value is not ``yes``.

:func:`audit_content` emits ``GRADED_BY_DESIGN_IS_HEURISTIC`` for every ``yes`` standing on
the weak evidence, so the known-wrong candidates are ENUMERATED on every run rather than
described in prose. T7 must not treat a weak ``yes`` as gradeability. Mirrored in
``config/house_law_checks.yml`` known_limits.

WHAT THIS MODULE IS
-------------------
Pure functions over already-loaded objects. It reads no files and writes no files. File
I/O and the sparse-worktree ladder live in ``scripts/build_intelligence_registry.py``; the
structural validator lives in ``scripts/check_intelligence_registry.py``. Where a
derivation needs the filesystem — resolving a ``qual_ladder_ref`` against a repo path —
the probe is INJECTED (``file_exists``) so the caller can route it through the git ladder
rather than through ``os.path.exists``, which goes blind on a sparse cone.

Per house epistemics a null never blocks: absent inputs produce ``None`` sentinels that
render as "could not look", never as "looked and found nothing". That is why an unprobed
``qual_ladder_ref`` resolves to ``"unchecked"`` and never to ``"unresolved"`` — and why
``"unchecked"`` is NOT counted as evidence by the C-1 gate either.

    re-running this measurement.

       artifact IN THE SAME ``owner_program`` -> that consumer's ledger path.  **WEAK**
    5. else the literal string ``'none'``, mirroring data/species/registry.json's own
       ``ledger_binding`` convention.

    Rules 1 and 4 match on a PATH / MODULE-NAME SUBSTRING, so a ``graded_by_design: yes``
    they produce is a guess. The strength is recorded per engine and enumerated by
    :func:`audit_content`; see the module docstring's known-limit section.

    RULE 4 WAS CROSS-PROGRAM UNTIL 2026-08-14, AND THAT FORM IS DELETED. Measured on the
    live corpus that day: 7 engines resolved by rule 4 and SIX of the seven hops crossed a
    program boundary and were wrong or unearned — flagrantly ``engine/run.py::engine-fix``
    (the nightly orchestrator) adopting hk-canada's ``data/board_ledger/ca_board.parquet``,
    and ``scripts/build_stock_library.py::us-stocks-prebreakout`` resolving through
    ``scripts/grade_us_board.py``, a producer that owns TWO cells with DIFFERENT ledgers,
    so the per-PRODUCER index made an arbitrary pick. The index is now keyed by
    ``(producer, owner_program)`` and the hop may only land inside the resolving engine's
    own program, which kills all six wrong hops and the arbitrary pick in one move. The
    single same-program hop that survives
    (``engine/experiments_registry.py::qualitative-intelligence`` ->
    ``engine/qledger.py::qualitative-intelligence``) is structurally plausible: a program
    grading its own output. The six now fall to rule 5 —
    ``ledger='none'``, ``graded_by_design='no — not yet'`` — which is the honest value: an
    engine that publishes no grading semantics it can earn.

    DEVIATION, deliberate: the brief made rule 2 conditional on the desk having >0 rows in
    ``data/qledger/claims.jsonl``, demoting a zero-row desk down the waterfall. That would
    SILENTLY hide the very gap it detected, so the desk resolves structurally here and a
    zero-row desk is raised by :func:`audit_content` as ``LEDGER_DECLARED_BUT_EMPTY``.
    Measured 2026-08-12: exactly ONE engine resolves a desk at all
    (``scripts/build_whitehouse.py::whitehouse-desk``) and ZERO desks are empty, so the
    finding fires on nothing today — a tripwire whose condition has not occurred.
