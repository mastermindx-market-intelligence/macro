"""Quant Lab model registry — what the vendor DISCLOSES vs what we can BUILD.

Every field here is either quoted from a public source (with `provenance`) or marked as
our inference. That boundary is load-bearing: Fintel's QV/QVM/QVO are proprietary and
only PARTIALLY disclosed, so a recreation is necessarily a reconstruction from the
published lineage plus the numeric readouts the vendor prints in its own syndicated
articles. Pretending otherwise would manufacture a fidelity we do not have.

FIDELITY GRADES (per leg, per mode):
    faithful  our input is the vendor's stated input, computed the stated way
    proxy     a defensible stand-in with a NAMED distortion (recorded in `distortion`)
    absent    our substrate cannot compute it at all -> the leg is dropped and DISCLOSED

MODES:
    live      latest cross-section. May use non-point-in-time panels, so it is a
              SNAPSHOT, never backtest evidence.
    pit       point-in-time. Only panels with a real filing/availability date
              (fundamentals_panel.asof_date, statements_quarterly.filed) qualify.
              This is the only mode `study.py` will score.

The `statements.parquet` panel is deliberately NOT a pit source: its `as_of` column
holds five FETCH timestamps (all 2026-06-15), not filing dates, so every row would be
knowable at every historical rebalance. Using it in a backtest would leak the future.

# The MODELS registry above scores names: legs -> percentile -> composite -> rank-IC. Some
# published methods make a claim of a different SHAPE — about when a strategy works, not
# about which name to hold — and they cannot flow through legs.py/score.py/study.py at all.
# Forcing one into that pipeline would invent a per-name score the method never had.
#
# So a method gets a spec here (what was proposed, by whom, and why it is not a ranker) and
# its MEASUREMENTS come from a committed result artifact under data/quant_lab/methods/,
# written by the method's own harness. NUMBERS ARE NEVER TYPED INTO THIS FILE: a hand-copied
# statistic outlives the recompute that would have corrected it, and this registry has no way
# to know it went stale. `page.py` reads the artifact; if it is missing the card still renders
# and says the measurement is unavailable.

# `our_fundamentals_universe` and `published_leaders_in_our_fundamentals_panel` are
# LIVE-DERIVED at page-build time (engine/quant_lab/page.py:_live_coverage) — they were
# hardcoded at 1,552/4 and W2-A (#4688) widened the panel to ~2,826, which would have left
# the page printing a stale coverage chip and the flatly false sentence "CMT and KRT are in
# our price universe with no fundamentals at all". The values below are FALLBACKS used only
# when the panel cannot be read. `*_at_study` is the frozen historical fact — the study's IC
# numbers were computed on the 1,552-name panel and do not change when the panel grows.

    under the QVM name. That happened on the first study run: `fintel_qvm` came back
    "survives FDR" on an IC identical to plain 6-month momentum. A model that reduces to
    one of its own legs is not that model.
