"""Theme Rotation alert engine — fires when a theme's READ changes, run over run.

Unlike the price-driven alert engines (bonds/forex/commodity recompute a full event
history from a time series), a theme's LABEL and RECOMMENDATION are model outputs with
no stored historical series, so this engine is CHANGE-DETECTION across runs: it diffs
today's engine.theme_scoring payload against the prior snapshot persisted in
data/themes/state.json and emits an event only when something actually flipped —

  reco_change          a basket's recommendation moved (e.g. HOLD -> ACCUMULATE)
  theme_emerging       a basket entered the EMERGING lifecycle
  theme_topping        a DOMINANT leader rolled over into FADING
  theme_deteriorating  a basket broke down into DETERIORATING
  leadership_rotation  a new theme took the #1 score rank

Event schema matches the other engines (id, ts, source='themes', asset, type, severity,
headline/detail + _zh, context, anchor) so engine.alert_triage picks it up with zero new
plumbing. Writes data/themes/alerts.jsonl (append + dedup by id, ~90d kept) and the
state snapshot. FIRST run (no prior state) SEEDS silently — never an alert storm.

CONSTRUCTIVE-side changes are additionally DEBOUNCED (see apply_debounce): an upgrade
into ACCUMULATE/ENTER, or a new #1 rank, only fires after it persists N_STREAK
consecutive builds (leadership also needs a real score margin). Risk-direction events
are NEVER delayed — see the asymmetry rationale at the constants below.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Asymmetric debounce — constructive side ONLY. This asymmetry is the design, not an
# accident:
#   * RISK-direction alerts (theme_topping, theme_deteriorating, any reco DOWNGRADE such
#     as accumulate/enter -> hold/trim/avoid) are the validated drawdown-control channel
#     (backtested: these reads precede deeper forward drawdowns on 27y of sector history).
#     They stay IMMEDIATE — never buffered, never delayed, passed through byte-identical.
#   * CONSTRUCTIVE-direction changes (upgrades into ACCUMULATE/ENTER, and
#     leadership_rotation) have NO measured forward-return edge (rank-IC ~ 0, descriptive
#     only), so a one-build delay costs nothing measurable while killing the oscillation
#     spam. Measured churn that motivated this (data/themes_china/alerts.jsonl, 2026-06):
#     cn_ai_compute's reco flapped HOLD<->ACCUMULATE 4 times in 7 days (06-22 -> ACC,
#     06-23 -> HOLD, 06-24 -> ACC, 06-26 -> HOLD, 06-29 -> ACC) and the #1 theme rank
#     rotated 6+ times in 6 sessions, twice within a single day on 06-25 and 06-26 —
#     the per-day dedup id only blocks exact same-day duplicates, so every oscillation
#     re-fired.
# NOTE: this debounce buffers DISPLAY/alert events only. No allocation or name-selection
# path reads this state, and none may ever be added here.
N_STREAK = 2
# a constructive flip must HOLD for 2 consecutive builds before it fires; a flip that
# reverts on the next build never fires at all (kills the measured 1-build whipsaws
# like brokers' same-day HOLD->ACC->HOLD on 06-22). The count advances AT MOST ONCE PER
# SESSION DATE: the Asia lane double-builds intraday (daily + asia-close), and replaying
# the recorded churn showed pure build-counting lets a flip "confirm" within half a day
# (cn_ai_compute's 06-22 ACC confirmed on the second 06-22 build, then reverted 06-23).
# Two same-day builds are one observation, not persistence — but a same-day revert still
# kills the streak.
LEAD_MIN_MARGIN = 3
# leadership_rotation additionally needs the new #1's margin over rank-2 to be >= 3
# points on theme_scoring's 0-100 composite AT THE CONFIRMING BUILD. The measured
# rotations were photo-finishes (65 vs 65 on 06-26; the live state snapshot shows rank1
# 63 vs rank2 60) — a <3-point lead is inside the composite's day-to-day wobble, so a
# handoff below that margin is rank noise, not a leadership change worth announcing.
