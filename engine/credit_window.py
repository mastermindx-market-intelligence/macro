"""Credit issuance window — DISPLAY-ONLY, NEVER-SCORED gate for new bond deals.

Mirrors engine/ipo_radar.py's window_context() pattern: a coincident read of
whether borrowers can place new bonds RIGHT NOW, built from market-wide spread
and rates-vol series that the F01 credit-axis owners already read (read-only,
no re-ingest, no writes, no network).

Two lanes: high-yield (HY OAS) and investment-grade (IG OAS) borrowers. Each
lane reads three inputs: where today's spread sits in its own 1-year range
(spread_range), the recent move in that spread (spread_drift), and rates
volatility (rates_vol, MOVE index — shared, identical value in both lanes).

NOTHING here is a scored signal, nothing here feeds any axis/regime/allocation,
and no issuer identity, par amount, or notional is ever touched — this module
reads only market-wide index series and performs no join of any kind.
`SCORED = False` is asserted by tests/test_credit_window.py.
