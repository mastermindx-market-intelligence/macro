"""US candidate-pool lanes — a LOSSLESS, DISPLAY-TIER partition of the eligible pool.

Operator commission 2026-08-11: *refused / below-cutoff candidates must stay visible
in a lower pool and be able to graduate to the real list when their scoring improves.*

WHAT THIS FIXES.  The US board publishes only its ``buy[]`` lane.  Counted on the
committed 2026-08-07 board (``site/factordata/us_standouts.json`` as of origin/main
``8c2d152``): ``eligible`` is **144** and ``buy`` holds **78** rows, so **66
cascade-eligible names get no published row at all** — ``scripts/build_stock_library.py``
discloses them as a single integer (``wide["eligible"]``) and the concentration stat's
``overflow_count``.  The 66 decompose as **55 sector-cap overflow** (``overflow_count``)
+ **6 earnings-blackout suppressions** (``earnings_blackout_note.tickers``: UAMY, ASTS,
LITE, SVM, CRC, ONON) + **5** across the dual-class dedup and the sector-integrity
backstop.  A name that was displaced by the per-sector soft cap is, from the artifact's
point of view, indistinguishable from a name the gate never saw.  The CN board ships the
fix already:
``engine/china_board_rank.py::_partition`` places EVERY eligible row into one of four
lanes, each row carrying ``lane``, ``lane_reasons`` and ``display_rank`` (real counts on
the 2026-08-10 CN board: eligible 180 = 24 + 93 + 41 + 22).  This module ports that
SHAPE — not CN's A-share specifics — to the US vocabulary.

ZERO AUTHORITY, AND THE FENCE IS A FILE BOUNDARY.  This module is DISPLAY TIER.  It
changes no ``buy[]`` membership, no ``buy[]`` ordering, no admission gate, no score, no
rank and no size.  It reads verdicts and rows that a producer already computed tonight
and re-describes them; it originates nothing (glass-box law, A7).  It lives in its own
file precisely so that fence is greppable and testable: this module imports FROM
``us_board_rank`` / ``prophet_bridge``, and **nothing on the authority path imports it**
— ``tests/test_us_candidate_lanes.py::TestNoAuthorityLeak`` pins that as a static token
sweep, an import-closure walk and a behavioural invariance check on
``prophet_bridge.select_candidates``.  Folding this into ``us_board_rank`` would make
that fence unstateable, which is the whole reason it is not folded in.

Graduation is **not** a new promotion rule.  A name graduates by clearing the EXISTING
gates on a later night; this module only makes the trajectory visible
(``days_in_pool`` / ``score_delta_5d`` / ``lane_transitions``).  Nothing here auto-
promotes anything (``DNR:KILL-CHATTER-PROMOTION``), and the lower tier is display-only
(``DNR:KILL-PRIMED-DIRECTIONAL-GATE``).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHY ``prophet.score`` IS NULL OFF THE BUY LANE (read before "fixing" it)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
``us_board_rank.score_rows`` computes its ``edge`` leg from
``alpha_percentiles(pool)`` — a CROSS-SECTIONAL percentile over the pool it is handed.
So there are only two ways to score the 66 off-board names, and both are wrong:

* score them as their own pool → their ``edge`` legs are percentiles of a DIFFERENT
  population than the published ``buy[]`` scores.  Two rulers wearing one name; every
  cross-lane and cross-night comparison the operator asked for silently breaks.
* score them together with ``buy[]`` → every published ``buy[]`` row's ``edge``
  percentile moves, which moves its score, which moves the board ORDER.  Forbidden.

So the off-board rows carry ``prophet: null`` with ``prophet_score_basis: null``, and
the store's existing disclosure ("legs are null off the board",
``data/us_prophet_rank/README.md``) is inherited rather than contradicted.  What they
DO carry is :data:`pool_rank` — their position in the board's OWN pre-cap blend order
(``signal_gate.blend_sorted``), which is defined for all 144 names, is membership-blind,
is already computed tonight, and is therefore the one trajectory key that IS comparable
across the whole pool and across nights.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECLINED-COUNT BASIS (rider debt, resolved here by naming the canonical one)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
``prophet_bridge.refusal_receipts`` is called from two sites that see different facts:

* ``scripts/build_site.py`` knows the admission gate but NOT tonight's origination run
  (``build_site`` runs before ``build_prophet``, and ``render.yml`` never runs
  ``build_prophet`` at all), so it reports ``declined`` 25 / ``open_now`` 48.
* ``scripts/build_prophet.py`` passes ``originated_tickers`` and reports 56 / 23.

**build_prophet's originated-aware basis is CANONICAL.**  A row that cleared every gate
and got no plan is a decline, and only build_prophet can see that.  This module is
stamped from the build_site-side lane (``build_stock_library``), so its own tally is the
gate-only basis and says so in the block: ``declined_basis == "build_site_gate_only"``
with a pointer to the canonical figure.  It reports the honest number it can compute and
labels which one it is, rather than printing the smaller one unlabelled.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHY THE STORE DOES NOT CARRY ``originated``
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The dated pool store is the EXISTING ``data/us_prophet_rank/candidates`` — see
:func:`store_columns`.  It is stamped by ``build_stock_library`` at the end of its
nightly run, i.e. before ``build_prophet`` has originated anything, and the store's
charter forbids retroactive backfill AND forbids shipping a column that can never be
populated ("never leave schema that lies", README §Named debts).  Origination is
``build_prophet``'s fact and already lives in its own artifact and ledger; a study joins
on ``(stamp_date, ticker)``.  What IS knowable at stamp time — whether a name already
holds an OPEN plan, because open plans persist across nights — is stamped as
``pool_open_plan``.
