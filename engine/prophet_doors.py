"""Prophet shadow candidate DOORS: **T (theme-relay)**, **R (re-arm)**, **W (washout-turn)**.

Program: `research/PROPHET_US_TREND_INTELLIGENCE_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md` §5 W3 (Doors T/R)
and `research/SIGNAL_EPISODE_ATLAS_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md` §4 W5 (Door W).
Pre-registration (FROZEN before first accrual): `research/PROPHET_DOORS_PREREG.md`.

WHAT THIS IS
------------
Three candidate ORIGINATION doors, shipped as **shadow-accrual lanes**: they append
forward-graded flags to their own ledger and nothing else. The masterplan's §2 audit found
the incumbent fresh-cross family sights most eventual winners but holds them for a median of
3 sessions, and that hot-theme members sit veto-blocked by construction (44 of the top-50
21d movers are stoch_ob-family vetoed). §2.5 measured the naive remedy — "unblock the
leaders" — and it FAILED (leader pullback-reset −2.12% per-name median excess), while the
laggard-cross cell was the one positive (+1.44% per-name). So neither door loosens a veto:

  **Door T (theme-relay).** The VALIDATED incumbent trigger, UNMODIFIED (`signal_gate`
  eligible ∧ :func:`engine.signal_gate.is_buyable`, tiers T1/T2/T3), fired on a member of a
  top-5 heating theme. The only new thing is candidacy ROUTING — theme heat conditions WHICH
  validated fires get recorded, never WHETHER a fire is a fire. Theme state is a
  cross-sectional context, so this claims nothing per-name (DNR:KILL-ONSET-FINGERPRINTS / DNR:KILL-VOLUME-FINGERPRINTS).

  **Door R (re-arm).** The MSFT/PLTR-class re-entry: a name whose trend is intact
  (above200 ∧ weekly_bull) but whose master cross has gone stale (3-15 ticks) and is
  therefore NOT eligible today, whose 2D leg has just re-crossed up on a COMPLETED bucket
  while the 3D StochRSI stays constructive (K ≥ D). Keys on trend-intactness + reset, never
  on washout DEPTH (#1747 Amendment-3).

  **Door W (washout-turn).** The class the Signal Episode Atlas census found Prophet blind
  to: of the 117 names in WASHOUT_TURN/TURN_WATCH on 2026-07-31, **0 were on the board and
  109 were invisible to Prophet**, and the highest-conviction sub-class — WASHOUT_TURN with
  2D+3D+W all bullish — held **65 names of which 61 were invisible**. The MCD miss is a live
  61-name class, not an anecdote. Door W RECORDS the ENTRY into that class: the display-tier
  `engine.washout_turn` organ says WASHOUT_TURN, the cross is FRESH (≤ 2 completed weeks
  old), and both faster canon grids (2B, 3B) are bull on their last completed bars. It keys
  on the DISPLAY-tier watch state + grid alignment — it is a RECORD of candidates, never an
  entry-stack leg or a gate covariate (#1747 Amendment-3), and the sector-grain washout→turn
  null (Oracle P8 P-W1/S-W3) is acknowledged, not re-litigated: the door exists to grade the
  CONDITIONED name-grain class FORWARD, prospectively.

ZERO AUTHORITY (the whole point)
--------------------------------
Nothing in the pick chain imports this module. No board membership, no plan origination, no
rank / gate / size influence, no user-facing surface. It is a display/shadow tier lane, which
under house epistemics ships freely — a null never blocks accrual. Promotion to any authority
requires the pre-registered gate in PROPHET_DOORS_PREREG.md §4, and a PASS there buys only a
REVIEW (an operator-ratified adjudication), never automatic authority.
`tests/test_prophet_doors.py::test_no_authority_*` pins the import fence.

PROSPECTIVE ONLY
----------------
There is NO historical backfill. The ledger starts accruing the night this merges, mirroring
the PSS prospective-accrual charters. Every row is a real forward call made without hindsight.

RECORDED FEATURES ARE NOT FIRE CONDITIONS
-----------------------------------------
Each flag carries an analysis-only feature block — Doors T/R: relay position, admission-day
turnover, Foresight Desk stage (:data:`FEATURE_KEYS`, prereg §9 addendum 2026-08-04), plus the
W8 ignition states, coil and theme thrust (§10 addendum 2026-08-05); Door W: era / regime /
archetype + the Signal Episode Atlas matching-episode posteriors (:data:`FEATURE_KEYS_W`,
prereg §10). They exist so the promotion read can test the CN-measured relay hypothesis, the W8
stand-in findings and the matching-episode hypothesis on US forward data from day one.
**They have ZERO effect on fire / cap / dedupe / grading**: :class:`_RecordedFeatures` and
:class:`_WashoutFeatures` are queried only AFTER a night's kept rows are already decided, and
both degrade to nulls on any failure. `tests/test_prophet_doors.py::TestFireInvariance` pins
that the fire set is identical with features on and off.

NIGHTLY IS THE SOLE ADVANCER
----------------------------
House law (CLAUDE.md §Ledgers). :func:`append_flags` refuses off-lane via
`engine.ledger_lane.nightly_advance_enabled` (COLLECT_LANE=nightly), so re-renders and
intraday lanes compute the same flags and discard them. :func:`emit` also takes
``dry_run=True`` for a no-write preview.

Run (nightly / DAG):   python -m scripts.emit_prophet_doors --nightly
Run (safe preview):    python -m scripts.emit_prophet_doors --dry-run

    Every bucket but the last is provably CLOSED (a LATER bucket already holds data), so only

    that test is exact arithmetic rather than a calendar guess: a bucket spans reference
    positions ``[b*n, b*n+n-1]``, so it has closed exactly when the tape's last session sits on
    its LAST position — ``session_positions(last_obs) % n == n - 1``.

    THIS FUNCTION READS ``_tf_bars``' INDEX. Before the anchor repair that index was pandas'

    <= last_obs". It is now each bucket's LAST OBSERVED SESSION, which would make that same
    expression drop a bucket that had in fact closed — silently delaying every Door R fire by
    a session. Pinned by tests/test_prophet_doors.py::test_closed_tail_bucket_is_kept.

    RUNTIME. Bounded by construction: at most ``2 * MAX_FLAGS_PER_DOOR`` (50) queries a night,
    and the one vectorised pass is over the trailing
    ``RELAY_HIGH_LOOKBACK + RELAY_POSITION_WINDOW`` (84) sessions of the HOT-THEME MEMBER
    columns of the universe frame already in memory — never a second full-universe sweep. Every
    input is loaded lazily, so a night with no flags pays nothing.

    The features
    ------------
    ``relay_count_3d`` / ``relay_position`` / ``relay_members_covered``
        Where in its theme's relay the name is firing. A "fresh high" is
        ``close > max(prior RELAY_HIGH_LOOKBACK closes)`` — the session a NEW 63-session
        closing high printed, not merely a session sitting at one.
    ``turnover_pctile`` / ``turnover_window``
        Admission-day share volume against the name's OWN recent history.
    ``foresight_stage`` / ``foresight_covered``
        The Thematic Foresight Desk's stage for the flag's theme, when the desk covers it.
    ``coil_compressed`` / ``coil_bars_compressed`` / ``coil_reason``
        The W8 S-COIL compression state for the flag's own name at the flag bar, and the
        compressed-session count in the trailing 21. Null + a reason slug when uncomputable.
    ``theme_thrust_state`` / ``theme_thrust_frac`` / ``theme_thrust_reason``
        The W8 S-THRUST-LAG thrust reading for the flag's own theme at the flag bar.

    RUNTIME, ignition. The two W8 features read `data/baskets/ohlcv/<ticker>.parquet` lazily,
    once per ticker per run, and each theme's thrust is computed once and shared by every flag
    in it. A night is bounded by (flags) + (members of the <= TOP_K_THEMES hot themes) distinct
    reads; measured 2026-08-05 at ~3.3 ms/ticker and ~200 tickers worst case, i.e. under a
    second on top of a run whose universe pass already dominates it.

    """Door W's per-flag analysis features — the Signal Episode Atlas matching-episode read.

    ZERO EFFECT ON THE DOOR, structurally, for the same reason :class:`_RecordedFeatures` has
    none on Doors T/R: :func:`emit` settles every W fire condition, the frozen depth priority
    sort, the cap and the dedupe, and only THEN calls :meth:`compute` on the rows it already
    kept. Nothing here can add, drop, or reorder a flag, and every failure path returns
    :func:`null_features_w`.

    SOURCE. `engine.event_atlas` — the SAME hierarchical shrinkage receipt the stock page
    renders, on the name's most recent **W-grid BULL** event. The direction is pinned:
    `event_atlas.live_state` quotes whichever event on the grid is LATEST, which for a name
    that printed a bear cross after its washout turn (ATO on 2026-07-31 is a live instance)
    would file a bear-class posterior under a bull entry — a different episode wearing the
    flag's name. ``atlas_event_on_cross`` then discloses whether the quoted bull event IS the
    door's own cross bar or an older one, so a stale quote is visible rather than assumed.

    The atlas is a MEASUREMENT artifact: class-conditional base rates over a survivor-biased
    backfill, never a forecast. They are recorded so the promotion read can ask whether the
    class posterior said anything about the forward outcome — the read is the ledger's, not
    the atlas's. The event library may simply not exist yet, in which case every key is a
    DISCLOSED null.

    RUNTIME. Bounded: at most ``MAX_FLAGS_PER_DOOR`` (25) receipts a night, on ONE grid each;
    the library frame and every class slice are memoised inside `event_atlas`.
