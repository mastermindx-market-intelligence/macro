"""Reviewed sponsor -> ticker candidate map for BioCatalyst post-selection context.

This module reads one bounded, curated, PR-reviewed lookup. It is deliberately
NOT a point-in-time identity service and NOT an inferred join:

* a row written by a model is a CANDIDATE, and a candidate never resolves;
* only a row a named human admitted in review (``reviewed_admitted``) resolves,
  and an admitted row must carry an OPERATOR ATTESTATION — a named reviewer, a
  timestamp, and the authorizing ruling bound by path and content digest. A
  model cannot manufacture attributed human authority, so admission stays a
  human act even though the map now resolves;
* an admitted row also declares its ``issuer_relationship``, because the
  claimed ticker is not always the sponsor: ``direct_issuer`` means the
  sponsor string IS the listed issuer, and ``parent_of_subsidiary_sponsor``
  means the sponsor is a SUBSIDIARY whose trials are attributed to the parent
  (a Genentech trial surfaces under Roche). That is a declared modelling
  choice, not a discovered fact, so the row says which one it is instead of
  leaving a reader to infer it from a name;
* everything else returns unavailable WITH A REASON, never a guess;
* ambiguity (several issuers, a subsidiary, a JV, a rename) is queued for a
  reviewer with its competing candidates recorded, never silently picked; and
* every link carries an effective interval, so a later rename or ticker reuse
  cannot rewrite what the map said earlier.

It collects nothing, connects to nothing, persists nothing, exposes no route,
and starts no process. It exists so BioCatalyst can explain a name AFTER
Prophet selects it; it may never originate, rank, reorder, size, or gate a
candidate, and it is wired to no scoring path.
