"""BC-M0a family clock activation: evaluate each entry gate, open only what holds.

The M0a policy (``config/biocatalyst_outcome_family_policy.yml``) declares nine
outcome families and, for each, an ENTRY GATE.  This module evaluates those
gates from evidence and records the answer as an append-only receipt through the
BC-O1a writer, so the activation itself is evidence rather than a hand-asserted
boolean in a YAML file.

Two rules give the evaluation its teeth:

* It owns exactly the two preconditions it can evaluate from evidence —
  ``o1b_outcome_writer`` (the writer contract and record kind exist) and
  ``eligible_source_registration`` (every source the gate names is registered,
  production-ingest-allowed, and has any repository-declared runtime/universe
  controls armed).  It both clears and raises those two.
  ``frozen_policy_version`` and ``eligible_identity_contract`` are a FLOOR: the
  frozen policy declares them, this module has no evidence that would clear
  them, and so it never does.
* It re-derives source eligibility on every run.  Rights permission alone is
  not a live collection path: an operator-armed source whose committed runtime
  switch is off or whose committed universe is empty remains ineligible.  A
  gate that says "satisfied" over such a source is a fabricated clock, and a
  clock that accrues nothing is worse than a closed one.  A family that names
  NO source is not evidence of eligibility either; its declared state stands.

Opening a clock means recording that a family accrues FROM NOW, bound to a
frozen policy version and to that policy's exact bytes.  It never means writing
history: there is no backfill path here, and the store refuses an accrual start
earlier than the instant the clock was opened.
