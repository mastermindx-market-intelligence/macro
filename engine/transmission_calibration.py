"""Transmission CALIBRATION — the historical episode miner + regime-conditional hop
calibration (TXI W3). A DISPLAY-ONLY LEAF: it imports the node-evaluation grammar from
``engine.transmission_chains`` (never the scoring core) and nothing in the scoring path
imports it. It turns each chain hop from "untested" into a MEASURED conditional base rate.

WHAT IT DOES (masterplan §5 TXI-R4 "calibration is the product", TXI-R6 regime-conditional):
For each chain, for each hop ``from_node -> to_node``:
  1. Scan the FULL history of the collected source series (``lib.store``-backed) and build,
     for each node, its boolean ACTIVATION history — the exact node test evaluated at every
     bar, REUSING ``transmission_chains.series_test_timeseries`` (no duplicated threshold
     parser). State-adapter nodes (transmission/regime/forex latest.json — no stored
     history) bind to a DOCUMENTED series proxy (TXI-R6 sanctions deriving a coarse cell /
     detector from an observable); a node with no reconstructable proxy is ``untested`` with
     the reason — NEVER fabricated.
  2. Find every bar where ``from_node`` fired (an "activation"); for each, measure whether
     ``to_node`` fired within the hop's ``lag_d`` window → the empirical
     ``P(hop confirms | upstream fired)`` with n.
  3. Split every activation by the REGIME CELL it occurred in (TXI-R6). Regime source:
     ``data/regime/regime_history.parquet`` (a real daily quad/liquidity/inflation
     time-series back to 1927) — the ``condition`` field of the hop selects which coarse
     cell to split on (supply-vs-demand oil → global-growth-accelerating; QE/non-QE vol →
     Fed-liquidity direction; etc.). When a regime series genuinely is not available for a
     condition, the POOLED rate is computed and the hop is marked
     ``regime_split: unavailable`` with the reason — NEVER a fabricated split.
  4. A cohort event-study where cheap: after a chain fully expresses historically, the
     forward return of the downstream cohort proxy vs SPY — descriptive, with n.

Output ``data/transmission/chain_calibration.json`` (``transmission_calibration.v1``):
per chain -> per hop -> {p_confirm, n, lag_d, per_regime:{cell:{p,n}}, regime_split, asof,
method}. Nulls / thin cells (n < ``N_FLOOR``) print ``"untested"`` WITH the n, never a
fabricated rate — honest coverage is the whole point (this is permanent knowledge accrual).

DISCIPLINE (masterplan §4; DNR:KILL-CAUSAL-DAG-ALPHA / TXI Article 1/2): display / LLM-context ONLY.
A base rate NEVER gates, ranks, sizes, or escalates anything; the word "validated" never
appears in emitted text; there is no LLM anywhere in this module. Every emit dict carries
``display_only=True``. FAIL-OPEN: absent history leaves a hop ``untested``, never raising.
Heavy compute (a full-history scan of ~10 series) runs OFF the render path on a WEEKLY
cadence (``scripts/run_transmission_calibration.py`` in weekly.yml), never nightly.

#       observable, same 63d window, same +30bp cut — reconstructed from the raw series.
#   vol.vol_expansion (live: vol_regime.regime in {warning, backwardation-stress} OR vix>=25)
#       → fred/VIXCLS vix_close >= 25. The VIX>=25 leg is reproduced EXACTLY; the categorical
#       4-state vol-regime label is engine-internal and not stored historically, so this proxy
#       is the OR's observable leg only (a HONEST PARTIAL — noted in the method string; it
#       under-counts activations that fired on the label alone below VIX 25).
#   dollar.dollar_spike (live: dollar_desk.trend=up AND usd_pos_pctile>=60) → fred/DTWEXBGS
#       broad dollar: price above its 50d MA AND 63d return>0 (trend up) AND level in the top
#       40% of its trailing 252d range (usd_pos_pctile>=60 ≈ rolling 1y percentile≥0.60).
#   dollar.usd_transmission_on (live: transmission.usd_dir=strengthening AND headwind_for
#       contains 'EM equities') → fred/DTWEXBGS 21d return>0 (strengthening). The headwind_for
#       membership is a derived label the forex engine writes when the dollar strengthens vs
#       EM; strengthening-dollar is its observable driver, reconstructed here.
#   real_rate_peak_{gold,crypto}_rerate.real_rate_extreme (live: transmission
#       latest.state.rates real_10y_pctile>=0.90 AND regime=restrictive) → fred/DFII10
#       trailing-1260d rolling percentile >= 0.90. Faithful by construction: the rate engine's
#       real_10y_pctile IS _pctile(us10y_real, lookback=1260) over the same DFII10 series
