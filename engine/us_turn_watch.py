"""engine/us_turn_watch.py — the TURN WATCH desk data plane (ANTICIPATION §6.9 R8).

WHAT THIS IS
------------
A nightly DECK of US names whose EARLIEST mechanical turn evidence fired inside the
last `TRIGGER_LOOKBACK_SESSIONS` sessions, each row carrying the operator's own manual
review checklist PRE-COMPUTED.

Operator reframe that commissioned it (`research/PROPHET_US_EYES_OPEN_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md`
§6.9 R8, 2026-08-08): *"if we get the signal early, I do the holistic review myself — but
if we don't surface them, names reach my desk up 10-15% and I chase."*  The operator IS
the second-stage filter.  So this surface optimises **RECALL and CONTEXT DENSITY, not
precision**.  A row here is not a candidate, not a plan, not a pick — it is a name whose
earliest evidence tier moved, printed next to enough context that a human can decide in
seconds whether to look harder.  Most rows will go nowhere.  That is the design, not a
defect, and every surface that renders this must say so.

AUTHORITY: **display tier, zero scored authority** (§6.0 / G0.6 form).  This module ranks
nothing that is graded, gates nothing, sizes nothing, and escalates nothing.  It does not
add to, remove from or reorder any `act_now` lane, board population, rank or gate.  The
`context_score` it emits is a DISPLAY-ONLY sort key — see :func:`context_score` — and is
labelled non-authoritative everywhere it is published.  A null never blocks a row: a
missing column is printed as `null` beside a plain-word reason, never as `0`/`False`
(the PLTR `above200` narration-gap precedent).

THE TRIGGER UNION (a name enters on ANY of the four, within the lookback)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) ``dot_1d`` — the DOT SIGNATURE on the DAILY series: StochRSI %K crosses above %D,
    %D was below `OS` (20) within the last `DOT_WASHED_WINDOW` (8) sessions, and the daily
    RSI-MACD histogram is rising.  This is §6.9's "earliest mechanical evidence" leg and
    the engine-side form of the grey-dot promotion in §6.8(b).
(b) ``pre_confluence_2d`` — a FRESH 2D RSI-MACD cross-up (within `FRESH_TICKS` 2D-ticks)
    while the 3D RSI-MACD has NOT yet crossed (3D histogram still below zero).  The 3D
    ``bars_to_cross`` is printed on the row, so "pre-confluence" is QUANTIFIED rather than
    asserted — the operator sees "~1.8 bars to cross" instead of a silent absence.
(c) ``basket_turn`` — membership of any basket whose `engine.us_basket_turn` lifecycle
    state is TURNING or CONFIRMED.  Cohort evidence, read from that organ's committed
    artifact/ledger; this module computes no basket state of its own.
(d) ``leader_reset_turn`` — the leader-pullback reset (§6.8(d) lane 2, the NVDA/AVGO-class
    catcher): a high-RS name in an intact uptrend takes a shallow controlled retrace, the
    daily stochastic resets, and turns back up.  Sourced from `engine.us_leader_pullback`
    (R4) — the FIRST session of its RESET_TURN state — falling back to the MINIMAL INLINE
    signature below only when that organ or its cross-section is genuinely unavailable.
    Every row stamps which one ran in ``leader_pullback_source``.

WHY THE INDICATOR HELPERS ARE IMPORTED, NOT FORKED
--------------------------------------------------
`_stoch_rsi_kd`, `_rsi_macd`, `_xup`, `_since`, `_tf_bars`, `_to_daily` and
`_completed_resample` are imported from `engine.confluence_tiers` even though they are
private there.  That is deliberate and ordered by the R8 brief: a forked copy of the
house StochRSI/RSI-MACD would drift from the cascade the deck is supposed to ANTICIPATE,
and the deck's whole claim ("the slow tier has not admitted this yet") is only meaningful
if both sides read the same instrument.  The known cost of a private-helper import is
that it carries its owner's ERA into this artifact, so the era travels WITH the numbers:
every artifact stamps ``anchor_era`` (confluence_tiers.ANCHOR_ERA) and
``indicator_source`` so a future amendment there is dated here rather than silent.

RUNTIME
-------
The nightly budget is law.  `compute_deck` measures its own wall clock and publishes it
as ``runtime_seconds``; a run that exceeds `RUNTIME_WARN_SECONDS` prints a bare
line-start ``::warning`` (this module runs inside an Actions step via
`scripts/build_turn_watch.py`, so it is NOT annotation-exempt).  `universe_limit` gives
the caller a DETERMINISTIC subset lever (alphabetical by ticker, disclosed in the
artifact) if the desk ever outgrows its slot; it is unset by default.

VOICE
-----
User-facing strings are windows-not-certainties (`DISCLOSURE`, `AUTHORITY`, `NOISE_NOTE`)
and carry zh siblings in :data:`LEXICON` for the page that ships next session under the
design lane.  Falsifier/refutation vocabulary is never used here (operator 2026-07-27).

# SWAP DONE (#5007 merged 2026-08-09): `engine/us_leader_pullback.py` is R4 of the same run
# order and is now the LIVE construction for this leg.  Its public surface is a per-session
# STATE frame (`evaluate(close, rs_pct=...)`), not a boolean stream, so `_organ_reset_turn`
# maps it to the EVENT this deck reads: the FIRST session of a `RESET_TURN` state.  Mapping
# the whole state to True would make `days_since` meaningless (0 for as long as the state
# holds) and inflate the fire count — an early-surfacing deck reads entries, not tenure.
#
# The organ's LEADER leg reads a PIT CROSS-SECTIONAL RS percentile it never computes for
# itself: pass none and every row prints `rs_pct_unavailable` and NO state, so the lane goes
# DARK rather than merely quiet.  `_leader_rs_cross_section` builds it once per run over the
# graded universe (`us_leader_pullback.rs_excess_percentile`) and the deck hands each name
# its own column.  Callers without a cross-section (the per-name replay below) fall back
# inline and say so — `leader_pullback_source` is stamped on every row, so which construction
# produced a fire is never a guess.
#
# The inline signature is retained for genuine absence (organ missing, cross-section
# unavailable, organ raised).  It is deliberately the WEAKEST honest form of §6.8(d) lane 2:
# high relative strength, an intact uptrend, a SHALLOW controlled retrace (not a washout), a

# first leader row sat at rank 41 — because two of the score's terms (`washout`, `base`) are
# washout-shaped by construction, and a leader-pullback name is SHALLOW by definition and can
# never compete on them.  A cap that silently deletes an entire lane is not a recall surface,
# and §6.8(d)'s standing doctrine is explicit that no single lane is the answer ("the battery
# is the answer").  So the floor is structural, disclosed in `coverage.lane_floor` and
# `coverage.deck_by_trigger`, and applied BEFORE the score fills the remainder.  It changes

    Walks the last ``sessions`` daily bars, TRUNCATING the series at each day before every
    read, so the 2D/3D legs see the incomplete trailing bucket they actually had that day
    (the `prophet_stage_shadow` pattern; a full-series pass would hand every interior day a
    bucket that had not closed yet).  Writes nothing — a replayed date is evidence for a
    receipt, never a ledger row.

    Trigger (c) (group turn) is ABSENT from this replay by construction and said so on the
    return: `us_basket_turn`'s forward ledger begins 2026-08-07, so there is no honest
    historical basket state to read, and back-filling one would manufacture the very
    earliness the replay is meant to measure.  The dates below are therefore the union of
    (a), (b) and (d) only — a LOWER bound on the deck's surfacing date.

    TWO comparisons are returned, because the literal one is boundary-sensitive:

    * ``first_trigger_*`` — the FIRST deck entry anywhere in the window.  When
      ``first_trigger_at_window_start`` is true the name was already triggering before the
      window opened, so that date is a floor imposed by the window, not a measurement.
    * ``paired_trigger_*`` — the LAST deck entry at-or-before the confirmation date.  A tight
      lower bound, and usually ~1 session: `pre_confluence_2d` fires by construction on the
      bar before the 3D crosses, so the last trigger before a T2 is nearly always adjacent.
      Quoting this alone UNDERSTATES the desk and is kept precisely so it cannot be hidden.
    * ``leg_trigger_*`` — **the number that answers the operator's question.**  The FIRST deck
      entry inside the up-leg the confirmation happened on, where the leg starts at the low
      the `% off 20-day low` column is itself measured against (the minimum close in the 20
      sessions preceding the confirmation).  Trigger and confirmation are then measured off
      the SAME low, in the same move: "the desk had this at +6% while the confirmation tier
      took it at +15%" is a statement about one event, not two unrelated ones.

    Returns a dict; every field is None-with-a-note when it could not be measured.
