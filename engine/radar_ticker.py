"""Per-ticker Divergence Radar (Phase 2) — the #1 gap: the basket radar masks names.

ADDITIVE · LEAF. A parallel, per-NAME divergence read that does NOT touch the
basket radar. It reuses signals already published per ticker:

  • activity (supply-side "smart money is moving"):  the Signal Intelligence Desk
       signal_score (0-100) from site/altdata/mastermind.json — which conveniently
       ALSO carries rs_vs_spy_60d, so we get price for free.
  • price (the already-priced consensus):  rs_vs_spy_60d (60-day relative strength).
  • confirmation: ETF flow direction (fund_flows) + options positioning (GEX).

The divergence is the edge: high activity + flat/down price = POSITIVE (smart money
ahead of the tape); high price + cooling activity = NEGATIVE (price ahead, distribution).
Emits site/basketdata/radar_ticker.json, ranked by edge_score. Context-only, never a
trade trigger; falsifiable per-ticker theses are seeded for later grading vs SPY.

    The basket radar fires a theme-level flag (e.g. 'housing POSITIVE_DIVERGENCE') but only

    a flagged basket, a member LAGGING its peers (bottom of the ret_20d distribution) while
    the theme's activity is up carries the UNPRICED divergence; a leader has already moved.
