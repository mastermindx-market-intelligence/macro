"""Per-ticker alt-data rollup — the shared substrate the score / narrative / model
layers read.

`engine.altdata` produces CROSS-SECTIONAL signal lists (top congress buys, top
contract winners, …). This module INVERTS them into one record per ticker, so any
downstream consumer (the per-stock conviction chip, theme discovery, the falsifiable
ledger, the Claude-CLI brain) can look a ticker up in O(1):

    data/altdata/by_ticker.json
    { "tickers": { "EFX": {convergence_score, channels, congress_net, gov_contract_usd_30d,
                            insider_net_usd, lobbying_usd, dpi_lean, trump_side, donor_usd}, ... } }

Display / context-only. Pure read of the feed signals; no network, no LLM. The
`convergence_score` = count of DISTINCT independent channels lit on a ticker — the
connection / unusual-activity measure. Corporate-PAC donations are recorded but do
NOT count toward convergence (nearly every large-cap donates, so it would over-fire).
