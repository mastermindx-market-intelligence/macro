"""13F Smart-Money TRADE TRACKER — turn the curated super-investor snapshots into a
graded, per-TRADE scorecard so we can see *who made the excellent trades*.

The neighbouring engine.smart_money diffs each fund's quarters into new/add/trim/exit
and answers "who holds this name". This module asks the sharper question the desk
actually cares about: **after a fund made a move, did it WORK?** For every position
change we place a look-ahead-free entry when the filing became publicly available and measure
the SPY-relative ("excess") return — both at a fixed 63-session horizon (apples-to-
apples skill) and live-to-latest-close (the realised "front-ran the rally" P&L). From
those rows we roll up:

  * a per-fund SCORECARD (buy hit-rate, average excess, best/worst trade, A–D grade),
  * a LEADERBOARD ranking the tracked funds by trade quality,
  * BEST / WORST trade boards across every fund, and
  * a per-fund ROTATION view (what each fund rotated INTO vs OUT OF last quarter).

The motivating contrast, straight out of the data: **Tepper (Appaloosa)** rotated into
semis/memory — new TSM (Q3) and a built-up Micron + NVDA — and front-ran the AI/memory
leg; **Ackman (Pershing)** concentrated into the Mag-7 laggards (AMZN/MSFT/META). The
tracker surfaces that quality gap empirically rather than asserting it.

PRICE COVERAGE — the one real upgrade over engine.manager_quality: it scored on the
S&P-only breadth caches and was therefore BLIND to ADRs, so a manager's biggest, best
trades (TSM, BABA, PDD, JD …) never scored. Here the close panel is the UNION of the
breadth caches AND data/yahoo/<T>.parquet (total-return adjusted), with SPY as the
benchmark — so the globally-diversified super-investors are finally measured on their
whole book.

HONESTY (surfaced on the page): 13F is quarterly with a ~45-day lag, long-only US
positions from managers above the $100M filing threshold — no shorts, options, or
non-US/private positions. "Since-filing"
excess uses a VARIABLE hold (an older quarter's trade has run longer than a recent
one), so it is a realised-P&L read, not a fixed-horizon skill metric; the 63-day excess
is the apples-to-apples figure. This is descriptive CONTEXT and a *track record*, never
a buy list and never wired into any score/allocation.
