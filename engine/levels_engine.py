"""engine/levels_engine.py — named gamma-level taxonomy + plain-English narration.

Voltick Gamma-Levels program, WP-A1 (see
research/VOLTICK_COMPETITIVE_SWEEP_AND_BUILD_PLAN.md §4/§5/§7). This is the engine
brick — the translation layer that turns one root's dealer-gamma ``by_strike`` payload
into a small vocabulary of *named levels* (Anchor / Call wall / Put wall / Flip /
Cluster / Counter / Void / Trapdoor / Launchpad / Stack), a single-meaning color law
(sticky / slippery + brightness), a net-gamma regime ribbon, and a plain-English note
per node. The Terminal Levels board (WP-A3) consumes the ``levels.v1`` schema next.

Pure + deterministic: given one ``options_hub.gex/v1`` payload (the dict emitted by
``engine.options_hub.compute_gex``) it returns a ``levels.v1`` dict. No I/O, no clock,
no randomness. It NEVER fabricates: a level absent from the input (no walls, no flip)
is emitted as a null node carrying an honest reason, never a made-up strike.

INPUT CONTRACT (``options_hub.gex/v1`` — see engine/options_hub.py:406 compute_gex):
  top-level : spot_ref, net_gex_bn, gamma_flip, call_wall, put_wall, by_strike,
              root, asof, convention, ...
  by_strike : list of rows, each
              {strike, gamma_net, gamma_call, gamma_put,
               delta_net, vanna_net, charm_net}  (all $mn, signed).

DEALER-SIGN PASSPORT (carried, not re-derived — engine/options_hub.py:7-14,
engine/gex_engine.py:115-133):
  sign = +1 calls, -1 puts; the dealer is ASSUMED long calls / short puts. This is an
  UNOBSERVABLE convention, NOT measured dealer inventory — robust for indices, fragile
  for single names (covered-call ETFs / retail call-buying can flip the true sign). So
  ``gamma_net`` carries an assumed sign: positive => "sticky" (dealer hedging leans
  AGAINST moves, price tends to hold), negative => "slippery" (hedging chases, price
  tends to slide). Every level here inherits that passport; nothing below measures
  inventory, and every read is positioning, not prophecy.

DISPLAY-TIER: nothing here ranks, gates, or advises trades. Levels are LOCATIONS where
dealer hedging concentrates, never targets. The words 'signal' and 'validated' are
banned in user-facing strings (house doctrine); narration is educational, not
directional.
