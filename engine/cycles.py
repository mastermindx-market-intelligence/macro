"""Cycle analysis + multi-timeframe technicals + the entry/exit signal ladder.

Methodology (graddhy.com, thefinancialtap.com — see DECISIONS):
- Daily cycle (DC): trough-to-trough, equities typically 36-42 trading days;
  the timing band catches ~70% of lows (that miss rate is displayed, never
  hidden). DCL = daily cycle low.
- Investor cycle (IC): 16-26 weeks, typically containing ~4-6 daily cycles.
- Swing low = price takes out the high of the candle that made the low;
  cycle-low confirmation adds: close back above the 10-day MA, and the 10-day
  MA turning up.
- Translation: where the cycle's crest fell relative to its midpoint.
  Right-translated = bullish structure; left-translated usually means the
  larger cycle has topped.
- Failed cycle: price breaks below the low that BIRTHED the current cycle —
  the single most reliable bearish tell in the framework (~80% per source).

Multi-timeframe indicators: daily, 3-day and weekly MACD(12,26,9), RSI(14),
RSI(5) and StochRSI(14) with cross detection plus *approaching-cross*
proximity (histogram trajectory), so the ladder can say "close to a turn",
not just "turned".

The ladder's per-state forward stats are measured by calibrate_ladder() and
shipped with the UI — trust levels are printed, not implied.

    (this name's sector sensitivity, engine.conditions.sector_macro_beta) add a
    risk-OFF, subtract-only, buy-setup-only conviction penalty for macro-sensitive
    names. `vix_ctx` = market panic context (engine.cycles.market_vix_context) used

    `vol_regime` = the published INDEX vol-regime snapshot (engine.vol_regime.published_snapshot:
    {regime, scored_score, scored_active, vol_target_scalar, ...}). In a risk-off kill-switch
    regime it adds a UNIFORM, subtract-only, buy-setup-only sizing caution (deepened only when its

    read — run on `price`, while the MACD / StochRSI / RSI momentum stats (`mtf_snapshot`,
    `early_signals`) stay on the passed `close` (the TR series, so a return/momentum stat
    keeps dividend fidelity).  This is D4 §7's structure-vs-momentum split.

    Default `price=None` reproduces the CURRENT behaviour BYTE-IDENTICALLY: everything runs
    on `close`.  This is the substrate seam ONLY — the split is a basis change, not an algo
    change; the momentum functions are unaffected and every structure function is called
    exactly as before, just on a different series.  D1 owns cycles.py conceptually; this
