"""GMI -> Data OS identity resolution bridge (V4-D2A frozen contract).

Contract: ``research/prophet_v4/d2/D2A_FROZEN_CONTRACT_2026-08-18.md``. Sol's D2A
ruling makes the Data OS identity spine (``data/reference/security_master.parquet`` +
``vendor_aliases.parquet``, read through ``lib.dataos.identity``) the estate's ONLY
exact issuer/security/listing identity authority. The GMI theme graph keeps its own
topology node ids (``co:<market>:<SYMBOL>[#epoch]`` — a graph-topology concern, never
recycled, per ``engine/theme_graph/identity.py``). This module is the BRIDGE between
the two: a re-derived side-car, ``data/theme_graph/identity_resolution.parquet``, that
answers "which Data OS security does this GMI company node name" — never a second
allocator, never a rewrite of either spine.

ONE ROW PER COMPANY-KIND NODE (``kind == "company"``), including refusals. `etf`/other
kinds carry no rows in v1. The row is re-derived on EVERY build (the capability-rule
pattern, never a node column — node rows are keep-first write-once, and an identity
resolution written once would be a one-way ratchet the master's own coverage growth
could never repair).

THE ALGORITHM (§4, ordered, first match wins) is deterministic and carries NO ticker
equality fallback: a symbol absent from the master AND every vendor alias space is
structurally incapable of becoming RESOLVED. Alias resolution goes ONLY through
``lib.dataos.identity.VendorAliasTable.from_records(...).resolve(vendor, symbol,
on=resolution_asof)``, queried across EVERY vendor space the committed alias table
carries — this module is the FIRST real consumer of that reader (Scout A finding 1).

``source_native_symbol`` is PARSE PROVENANCE ONLY — the symbol segment as split out of
the node id — and is NEVER a join key. The only sanctioned resolution path is this
module's reader API (``read_identity_resolution`` / ``resolve_graph_node_identity``);
nothing downstream may re-derive or re-match on ``source_native_symbol`` directly.

TWO READ PATHS (§5): ``read_identity_resolution()`` for the bulk latest-generation
view (the ``read_capability`` pattern — max ``computed_at`` per node), and
``resolve_graph_node_identity(node_id, asof=...)`` for one node, either from the
persisted sidecar (``asof=None``) or re-run PURELY over the committed inputs at an
explicit historical date (no store write, no second store). Both raise
``UnknownGraphNodeError`` for a node_id the graph itself does not carry — a known node
never returns an untyped/None resolution.

TWO-CLOCK LAW, CURRENT vs HISTORICAL mode (§4 amendment, post-adversarial-review
2026-08-18 — see D2A_FROZEN_CONTRACT_2026-08-18.md AMENDMENTS): the materialization
path (``derive_rows``, driven by a generation's ``belief_time``) resolves in CURRENT
mode — rule 6 may consult every vendor alias space, including the unconditionally-open
current-catalog rows (``store``/``yahoo_fetch``) that answer "what string do I use
TODAY for a bar of any date" (``AliasRow`` docstring, ``lib/dataos/identity.py``).
``resolve_graph_node_identity(node_id, asof=...)`` with an EXPLICIT ``asof`` instead
resolves in HISTORICAL mode: rule 6 may consult ONLY DATED alias rows (``valid_from``
or ``valid_to`` non-null) of the HISTORICAL vendor spaces as historical-naming
evidence — a current-catalog SPACE (``store``/``yahoo_fetch``) is never allowed to
answer a historical-naming question, because it was never given one; since 2026-08-28
those spaces may carry dated rows across a ratified key migration, so the exclusion
is by vendor identity (``_CURRENT_CATALOG_VENDORS``), not row shape.
Rule 5 (exact inception-code match) is asof-invariant in BOTH modes: the master's
``inception_code`` is the security's own canonical symbol, minted once and stored, so
it never depends on the query date.

ISSUER AXIS (V4-D2B1, 2026-08-19; FIX 8 / m3 amendment).  ``issuer_id`` is copied from
the master's own issuer axis ONLY WHEN the master row's ``issuer_state`` is
``RESOLVED`` — this module allocates nothing and repoints nothing, and never smuggles
an unevidenced or disputed value into the graph bridge as if it were confirmed
identity.  A RESOLVED sidecar row's ``issuer_id`` may be SHARED by more than one
company node's security (``co:us:GOOG`` and ``co:us:GOOGL`` both resolve to the same
``ISS:US-XNAS-GOOG``, per the master's CIK-evidenced grouping), while
``security_id``/``listing_key`` stay per-node distinct.  A RESOLVED sidecar row's
``issuer_id`` is null whenever the master's issuer_state for that security is
anything OTHER than ``RESOLVED`` — ``NO_ISSUER_EVIDENCE`` (a legacy/new master row
with no CIK evidence yet), ``AMBIGUOUS``, ``EVIDENCE_CONFLICT``, or
``DEFERRED_IDENTITY_EXCEPTION`` all null the sidecar issuer_id the same way.
``security_id``/``listing_key`` stay non-null regardless of the issuer axis, because
exact security/listing identity is unaffected by whether an economic issuer has been
evidenced.  ``scripts/check_theme_graph_contracts.py``'s state<->ids biconditional
(F3a) is amended accordingly: RESOLVED requires ``security_id``/``listing_key``
ALWAYS, and requires ``issuer_id`` iff the master's own issuer_state for that
security is ``RESOLVED`` (a non-null issuer_id on any other master state is a
breach — the bridge would be disagreeing with its own source of truth).
