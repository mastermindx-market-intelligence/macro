"""Source-local theme inputs and the vintage ladder they form (W3A §2, §9.5).

WHAT THIS IS. The Finviz theme tree is a SNAPSHOT source: each observation says which
tickers sit in which subtheme *today*, and says nothing about when any of it started.
A bitemporal store cannot ingest that as-is, so the observations are laid out as a
LADDER of dated vintages and the intervals are read off the ladder:

* a membership present in vintages i..j opens at ``asof(i)``;
* it closes at ``asof(j+1)`` — the first date the source was observed WITHOUT it, never
  an invented mid-window date, and never the date somebody guesses it "really" left;
* a membership that reappears after a gap opens a SECOND interval. It is not the same
  fact resumed, it is a new observation, and the store carries both.

Two properties are load-bearing and easy to get wrong:

``valid_from`` means FIRST OBSERVED. Under a manual refresh cadence the closing date is
INTERVAL-CENSORED — bounded by the gap between refreshes — so a consumer may read it as
"gone by then", never as "left on that day" (§9.6).

Dedupe is ADJACENT-ONLY. Collapsing every content-identical vintage would erase an
A→B→A revert into a single unbroken interval, which is exactly the history the ladder
exists to keep. Two identical snapshots taken back-to-back are one observation; the same
content re-appearing after something else is a new one.

VINTAGE 1 IS A DECLARED SEED. ``finviz_themes/finviz_themes_map.json`` (asof 2026-06-27)
predates the history tape and is named as the seed in code rather than back-dated into
the tape — the tape records promotions, and writing a pre-tape observation into it would
fabricate a promotion that never happened.
