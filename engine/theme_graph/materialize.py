"""Build nodes / edges / evidence from the live membership documents (masterplan §4.1).

INPUTS — all of them artifacts an owner already publishes; GMI assembles, never scores:

* ``data/{baskets,baskets_china,baskets_china_ths,baskets_hk,baskets_canada,baskets_intl}/membership.json``
* ``config/theme_crosswalk.yml`` (v3 — the TIL vocabulary, extended in place, never forked)
* ``data/baskets_china_ths/concept_map.json`` (同花顺 board → concept code)
* the newest RAW 同花顺 snapshot, passed in by the caller as ``(date, doc)``

EDGES BUILT HERE, and only these:

* ``MEMBER_OF``  company → basket, interval [added, removed)
* ``EXPRESSES``  basket  → theme, from the crosswalk's ``basket_ids`` (US),
  ``cn_basket_ids`` (curated CN) and the deterministic THS join
  (basket.ths_concept → concept_map code ∈ row.ths_concept_ids)
* ``TRACKS``     etf     → basket, where the basket declares an ``etf_proxy``

There is deliberately NO derived company → theme edge. Composing "A is in basket B"
with "basket B expresses theme T" into "A expresses T" would assert a fact no receipt
supports — the evidence grain is membership and expression, and the composition is the
consumer's join, made against evidence it can see.

HONESTY (directive §2C, gate G0.2). A backfill writes every row ``era="reconstruction"``
with ``belief_time`` = the run's own date: the graph never claims to have known these
memberships when they took effect. ``date_provenance`` separates a real dated
changelog entry from the seed CONSTANT every membership document uses for its first-run
members — that constant is where a series begins, not when a company joined a theme.
Nightly runs append only what actually changed, ``era="observed"``.

#: `era` and `belief_time` are deliberately NOT here. They describe how and when the row
