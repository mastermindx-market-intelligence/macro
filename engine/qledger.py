"""engine/qledger.py — the Universal Scoreboard (§2.2 of
research/QUALITATIVE_INTELLIGENCE_UPGRADE_BY_FABLE.md).

The ONE claims+grades substrate every scored number must pass through. It
generalises three ledger patterns already in the tree:
  * data/altdata/theses.jsonl rows — PIT `entry_levels {subject, bench}`,
    an engine-derived `falsifier`, `check_by`, `status`.
  * engine/radar_ic.py post-#904 — per-horizon grading, `horizon_d`-stamped
    snapshots, forward relative-return vs a benchmark.
  * engine/ai_desk.py — the price layer (`_close_series` with the S&P-1500
    breadth-cache fallback, `_level_asof`) and proxy-vs-bench scoring.

This module is the W1 CONTRACT the four W1 builders map their existing ledgers
onto by *adapter* — it does not itself write adapters, the nightly runner, or UI
(those are builder/W1-runner scope). It owns:
  * the CLAIM schema + `register()` validation (§2.2, D4, [P2]).
  * the GRADE model — multi-horizon [5,21,63] capped by the claim's horizon_d,
    matched-control excess, per-timestamp_quality embargo ([P2]).
  * the TRACK-RECORD emit — per-desk / per-claim-family, honest `n_dates`
    (independent date clusters, [P1]/§5), Wilson-CI lower bound, and the
    UNGRADED / ACCRUING / GRADED state chip the UI reads (D10).
  * the placebo-tape schema slot (`is_placebo`, D3) so B3's sampler just calls
    `register()`.

Price helpers are REUSED, never reinvented — the same parquet layer the whole
suite grades on.

# store — so a CN-priced claim (5,726 live: china_news, cn_importance_v0,

# NYSE sessions while its legs trade the A-share calendar. Two measured
# consequences on the live corpus (both reproduced in the commit message):
#   * 31.9% of live CN windows were the WRONG LENGTH — a "21 trading day" claim
#     spanning 20 or 22 A-share sessions, because US-only closures (Jul 3,
#     Labor Day) are not CN closures;
#   * on a representative 2025-2026 anchor sweep, 5.9% of h=21 CN windows land
#     an endpoint on a CN-only closure (Golden Week, Spring Festival) and are
#     therefore PERMANENTLY ungradeable — refused by rule 5, forever, because
#     no A-share bar will ever exist on that date.
# The CEO's rule — "resolve the exit using the canonical exchange calendar" —
# names the exchange the claim is priced on. For an A-share claim that is SSE/

#   day of mourning and the 2025-01-09 Carter day of mourning — and NOTHING
#   earlier. It is blind to every pre-2012 one-off closure (2001-09-11..14,
#   2004-06-11 Reagan, 2007-01-02 Ford, 1994-04-27 Nixon, …), each of which would
#   place a session-counted exit one or more sessions LATE without any signal.
#   The floor is the first day after the earliest modelled one-off closure; every
#   qledger claim asof is 2025+, so nothing live sits near it. Moving it EARLIER
#   requires appending the missing closures to `ONE_OFF_CLOSURES` first.
# CN / HK — floor AND CEILING. Both calendars are lunar-table driven

#   not raise — it silently returns a holiday set with NO lunar closures at all
#   (cn_calendar.holidays(2031) is Jan 1 + May 1 + Golden Week), so a 2031 exit
#   would walk straight through Spring Festival. The ceiling is therefore checked

#     label. This is the residual: bounded to +1 session, and undetectable by the
#     endpoint assertion because the bar does exist.

    trading_days: the exit is resolved by canonical exchange SESSION arithmetic
    on the calendar of the market the claim is PRICED in (`market`, dispatched
    through `CLOCK_CALENDARS`) — NOT `pd.Timedelta`, NOT a 1.4x fudge, and NOT
    `pd.offsets.BusinessDay` (BusinessDay counts Mon–Fri and so silently walks
    THROUGH market holidays: from a Wednesday before Thanksgiving, 2 BusinessDays
    lands on the Friday half-session having counted a day the market was shut).

    THE MARKET IS AN INPUT, NOT A DEFAULT, FOR EVERY CLAIM PATH. The `MARKET_US`
    default here exists only so a direct caller asking a US question keeps a
    one-line call; `make_claim`, `_validate_claim` and `grade_claim` all pass the
    claim's OWN market from `resolve_claim_market`, and refuse the claim outright
    when it cannot be determined. A CN claim resolved on NYSE sessions is not
    approximately right — see the MARKET DISPATCH note above for the two measured
    failure modes (wrong window LENGTH, permanently unreachable endpoints).

    WHY THE RULES CALENDAR AND NOT THE PRICE-STORE INDEX. The store index is a
    record of what was COLLECTED, not of what the exchange held: it has known
    holes (`collectors/cboe.KNOWN_PERMANENT_GAPS`, and `lib.nyse_calendar` exists
    precisely because a frozen store cannot detect its own staleness), and it
    differs PER TICKER — so a store-derived ruler would hand subject, bench and
    control three different horizon lengths, which is the exact failure rule 5
    forbids. `lib.nyse_calendar` is rule-computed, stdlib-only, holiday-aware and
    identical for every leg. It is already the house pattern for this arithmetic
    (`engine/source_registry._add_trading_days`, `engine/basket_turn_watch.py`).
    The store still decides MATURITY (`coverage_date`) — it just does not get to
    define what a session is.

    SUPPORTED RANGE: per market, from `CLOCK_MARKET_SUPPORT`. Anchors before the
    market's floor return None rather than resolve, because the session ruler
    models no earlier unscheduled closure and would place the exit late without
    saying so. CN/HK additionally carry a CEILING, checked against the resolved
    EXIT as well as the anchor: their lunar holiday tables stop at 2030 and the
    modules do not raise past it, they just return a holiday set with no lunar
    closures in it — see the constant's note.

    MINIMUM WINDOW: the resolved window must contain at least TWO sessions
    (the fill bar and a later exit bar). A `calendar_days` horizon whose exit
    lands before the next session — 1 calendar day from a Friday fill — has no
    measurable return, and resolving it anyway produced a window that
    `_matured_window` called matured while `_leg_ret_in_window` refused on its
    two-bar guard. The two now agree BY CONSTRUCTION: such a horizon has no
    window at all, so it is never matured and never graded.

#: EXCHANGE SUFFIXES THIS CLOCK REFUSES — an EXPLICIT, AUTHORITATIVE DENY-LIST.
#:
#: THE DEFECT THIS REPAIRS. The first two cuts of this dispatch discriminated on
#: the SHAPE of the suffix: "multi-letter => exchange, single letter => US share
#: class". That is right for `BRK.B` / `BRK.A` (527 legs in the live store) and
#: WRONG — silently, onto NYSE — for every real exchange whose Yahoo suffix is one
#: letter: `.L` (London), `.T` (Tokyo), `.F` (Frankfurt/Fukuoka). A shape
#: heuristic failed twice here; it is replaced by enumeration, and the residual
#: share-class branch now additionally requires the WHOLE symbol to pass the
#: house US-equity gate (`engine.ticker_shape.valid_us_ticker`).
#:
#: WHAT AN ENTRY CLAIMS, EXACTLY. Only this: "at least one non-US venue lists
#: symbols under this suffix, so a leg carrying it cannot be assumed to trade on a
#: calendar in `CLOCK_CALENDARS`." It does NOT claim to be the suffix's unique
#: meaning — `.F` is Frankfurt to one vendor and Fukuoka to another, `.CN` is the
#: Canadian Securities Exchange and not China, and `.N`/`.S` are Nagoya/Sapporo
#: under the Yahoo convention this repo's tickers follow while a RIC feed would
#: read `.N` as NYSE. Every entry produces the SAME outcome — a named, counted
#: refusal — so ambiguity between two foreign venues costs nothing, and the only
#: error that matters is an OMISSION (which grades a foreign name on NYSE).
#:
#: DIRECTION OF ERROR, STATED. Over-inclusion refuses a claim: visible, countable
#: (`count_unresolvable_clock_claims`), and repairable by mapping the suffix in
#: `session_anchor.MARKET_SUFFIX` + adding its calendar. Under-inclusion grades on
#: the wrong exchange calendar and says nothing. So this table errs INCLUSIVE.
#:
#: Suffixes in `MARKET_SUFFIX` are NOT repeated here — they are resolved, not
#: refused (`.TO`/`.V` map to CA and are then refused one step later by
#: `resolve_claim_market`, for the different and honest reason that this repo has
#: no Canadian session calendar). The disjointness is pinned by a test.

#: ROUND 5 — THE MARKET'S AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE IS THE CLAIM'S OWN PROVENANCE,
#: NOT THE TICKER STRING. Three rounds in a row (2, 3, 4) each patched a new
#: failure of the SAME assumption: "a claim's market can be read off the SHAPE
#: of its ticker." It cannot — a bare numeric like `600519` (Kweichow Moutai,
#: Shanghai) or `0700` (Tencent, Hong Kong) carries NO market information in
#: its shape at all, and the pre-round-5 fallback ("no suffix -> US") answered
#: US for those, silently, every time. The desk/claim_family a claim is
#: registered under is not a guess: `cn_importance_v0` / `cn_importance_v0_pit`
#: / `china_news` / `china_special_sits` price CN by construction (their
#: producers name a CN bench and pull from CN event stores); `us_importance_v0`
#: / `us_importance_v0_pit` / `radar` / `whitehouse` / `policy` price US by
#: construction. This table is that fact, made explicit and machine-readable —
#: it is consulted ONLY for a leg whose ticker shape carries no suffix (a real
#: exchange suffix is always a stronger, leg-level fact and is resolved first,
#: see `_ticker_market`); it never overrides one.
#:
#: A desk/family not listed here is NOT assumed to be either market — it falls
#: through to the shape-corroborated US fallback (`ticker_shape.valid_us_ticker`)
#: exactly as an unlisted desk always has, so every existing US lane (altdata,
#: narrative, intel_hub, basket_turn, flip_confirmation, placebo, …) is
#: untouched. Listing a desk here is a POSITIVE claim about its market and nulls
#: the shape fallback for that desk's non-suffixed legs — get it wrong and a
#: leg refuses loudly (counted) rather than resolving quietly on the wrong
#: calendar, which is the same inclusive-errs-safe design as
#: `EXCHANGE_SUFFIXES_UNSUPPORTED`.
#:
#: Both spellings a producer uses for the same family are listed (desk vs
#: claim_family sometimes drift — `china_special_situations.py` registers
#: `desk="china_special_sits"` but `claim_family="cn_special_sits"`).

#: INDEX SYMBOLS ARE ENUMERATED, NEVER INFERRED (P0a-2).
#:
#: THE DEFECT THIS REPAIRS. A `^`-prefixed index symbol fails
#: `ticker_shape.plausible_symbol` (the `^` is not in `PLAUSIBLE_SYMBOL_RE`), so
#: the round-5 resolver read it as "contributes NO market information, same as
#: an absent leg" and skipped it. For a claim whose SUBJECT is an index that
#: leaves only the bench — and the bench defaults to `_DEFAULT_BENCH` (SPY) —
#: so `{'desk': 'radar', 'scope': {'key': '^HSI'}}` resolved (US, ''), grading
#: the Hang Seng on NYSE sessions against SPY, silently. The skip is right for a
#: symbolic MACRO label (`CN_CENSORSHIP_RISK` — nothing is priced); it is wrong
#: for an index, which is a real priced instrument on a real exchange.
#:
#: A `^` symbol therefore resolves through this table or is REFUSED BY NAME. It
#: is never inferred from the string: `^HSI` and `^GSPC` are shaped identically
#: and trade on different continents, so there is nothing in the shape to infer
#: from. An omission costs a counted refusal; a wrong guess costs a silent wrong
#: calendar — so, like `EXCHANGE_SUFFIXES_UNSUPPORTED`, this errs toward refusal.
#:
#: ZERO live legs today: no `^` symbol appears in any leg of the 46,630-claim
#: corpus, and `_DEFAULT_BENCH` is `SPY`, not `^GSPC`. This is prospective, and

    The mapped-suffix table is `engine.session_anchor.MARKET_SUFFIX` — the same

    `session_anchor.market_for_ticker` resolves an UNMAPPED suffix to US openly
    (its R3 ruling: approximate bucket edges are harmless there). Here that
    default is not harmless — it is exactly the "silently resolving on the wrong
    calendar" this dispatch exists to stop — so this function refuses instead.

    THE DISCRIMINATOR IS AN ENUMERATION AND PROVENANCE, NEVER A BARE SHAPE
    DEFAULT. Three earlier cuts each read the ticker STRING as the sole source
    of market truth and each failed a new way: round 2 hardcoded NYSE for
    every claim; round 3 read "single letter after the dot" as a US share
    class, which fails OPEN onto NYSE for `.L` / `.T` / `.F` (real exchanges);
    round 4 enumerated the exchange suffixes but still answered US for ANY
    ticker with no suffix at all — silently wrong for a bare A-share code like
    `600519` or `0700`, which carries NO market information in its shape. The
    order is now:

      1. suffix in `MARKET_SUFFIX`                   -> that market (a real
         exchange suffix is a leg-level fact and always wins)
      2. suffix in `EXCHANGE_SUFFIXES_UNSUPPORTED`   -> REFUSED, by name
      3. a residual, un-enumerated MULTI-letter suffix -> REFUSED, unknown
      4. a SINGLE-LETTER residual suffix on a symbol the house US-equity gate
         (`ticker_shape.valid_us_ticker`) accepts  -> US (share class: BRK.B/BRK.A)
      5. NO suffix at all, and not even ticker-SHAPED on any exchange
         (`ticker_shape.plausible_symbol` is False — a symbolic macro label
         like `CN_CENSORSHIP_RISK`, never a real subject) -> contributes NO
         market information, same as an absent leg (`MARKET_UNDETERMINED_NO_LEG`
         — `resolve_claim_market` skips it and lets another leg decide)
      6. NO suffix, ticker-SHAPED, and `valid_us_ticker` accepts it -> US, but
         as an INFERENCE, not a fact — so it goes through `_corroborate` with
         `shape_is_decisive=False` and a disagreeing provenance REFUSES it
         (`AAPL` on a CN desk is a contradiction). The gate is bounded on both
         sides: the enumeration above has taken every known exchange suffix,
         and `valid_us_ticker` must accept the whole symbol, so no bare
         digit-first or symbol-first code — `600519`, `000001`, `0700` — can
         reach US by shape alone.
      7. NO suffix, ticker-SHAPED, shape SILENT, and the claim's OWN provenance
         (`_provenance_market`) names a market -> THAT market, but ONLY where
         `_shape_admits_market` agrees the string could be one (a CN desk's
         6-digit `600519` is admitted; a US desk's is not, because
         `valid_us_ticker` positively excludes a digit-first root). Provenance
         corroborates a silent shape; it never overrides a speaking one.
      8. anything else                               -> REFUSED
         (`MARKET_UNDETERMINED_NO_PROVENANCE`) — a ticker-shaped leg with no
         suffix, no provenance and no US shape has nothing to determine its
         market from, and this clock fails closed rather than guess.

    ORDER MATTERS AND IS NOT THE ROUND-5 ORDER. Round 5 tried provenance BEFORE
    the shape fallback, which is how the string `SPY` itself resolved CN under a
    CN desk. The shape is now read FIRST, and provenance is reached only where
    the shape says nothing. P0a-2's rule, stated once:

        a HARD exchange fact in the string (rules 1, 4, and the `^` index table)
        WINS outright — provenance may not veto it;
        an INFERRED shape reading (rule 6) must AGREE with a speaking provenance;
        a SILENT shape (rule 7) lets provenance decide, if the shape admits it.

    A claim whose legs then straddle two markets is refused one level up, by
    `resolve_claim_market`, as MIXED — which is a fact about the claim, not a
    disagreement between two classifiers.

    Rule 2 is not hypothetical: four live `china_special_sits` claims are priced
    on `920007.BJ`-style Beijing Stock Exchange tickers, a suffix `MARKET_SUFFIX`
    does not carry. `market_for_ticker` calls them US, which would have graded
    Beijing names on NYSE sessions. They refuse, visibly, until `.BJ` is mapped
    in `session_anchor` (that module's scope, not this one's — mapping it here
    would fork the table this reuses).

    Every refusal reason is `HEAD{CLOCK_REASON_SEP}detail`: the head is
    bounded-cardinality and safe to bucket on, the detail names the offender.

    sole source: hardcoded NYSE; then "single letter suffix => US share class",
    which reads `.L`/`.T`/`.F` (London, Tokyo, Frankfurt) as US; then "no suffix
    => US", which reads `600519` and `0700` as US. Round 5 inverted it and made
    PROVENANCE the sole source for a no-suffix leg — so a US-listed desk
    emitting a bare A-share code resolved US, silently, on NYSE sessions. The
    error was never which source was picked; it was that ONE source was allowed
    to be sufficient. A US desk claiming `600519` is not a market to guess. It
    is a CONTRADICTION, and the only safe answer is refusal.

    BUT "NEITHER IS AUTHORITATIVE ALONE" IS A RULE ABOUT INFERENCES, NOT ABOUT
    FACTS, and `shape_is_decisive` is where that distinction lives:

      * True — A HARD EXCHANGE FACT IS IN THE STRING ITSELF: a mapped suffix
        (`.SS`/`.SZ`/`.HK`), an enumerated `^` index, or a share-class suffix on
        a symbol the house US gate accepts. **The shape WINS; provenance may not
        veto it.** `0700.HK` names the Hong Kong exchange in the ticker. That is
        DIRECT evidence about the INSTRUMENT. `DESK_MARKET` is indirect evidence
        about the PRODUCER — a summary of what a desk has typically priced, not
        a promise that it can never price anything else. Letting the weaker,
        indirect signal veto the stronger, direct one is the same "one source is
        sufficient" error the history above is made of, merely inverted.
      * False — THE SHAPE READING IS ITSELF AN INFERENCE: a bare symbol that
        `valid_us_ticker` happens to accept. Here the two signals are of
        comparable strength, so the agree-or-refuse rule binds: a disagreeing
        provenance makes it a CONTRADICTION and the leg is refused.

    THE DEFECT THIS REPAIRS — AND IT WAS THIS FUNCTION'S OWN. The first cut of
    P0a-2 documented exactly the distinction above, threaded `shape_is_decisive`
    through all four call sites, added a test pinning every call site's value…
    and then **never read the parameter in the body**. Every caller therefore
    got the agree-or-refuse arm, so a hard suffix WAS vetoed by provenance:

        {'desk': 'china_news', 'scope': {'key': '0700.HK'}, 'bench': '2800.HK'}
            -> (None, 'shape_provenance_contradiction:HK!=CN')

    while the SAME claim on the unlisted desk `altdata` resolved `('HK', '')`.
    Admissibility depended on whether a claim's desk happened to be enumerated,
    which is backwards; and since `DESK_MARKET` carries no HK entry at all while
    HK is a first-class market in `CLOCK_CALENDARS`, **no enumerated desk could
    ever claim a Hong Kong security.** The pinning test could not catch it: it
    asserts the parameter's value at each call site, not its effect, so it is a
    guard that cannot fail on the defect it exists to gate. It is now paired with
    `test_a_hard_exchange_suffix_is_never_vetoed_by_provenance`, which asserts
    the BEHAVIOUR.

    A genuinely cross-market claim is still refused — just for the honest reason.
    `600519.SS` under a US desk resolves CN on its own leg, and
    `resolve_claim_market` then sees {CN: 600519.SS, US: SPY} and refuses as
    MIXED, because those two legs have no single session ruler. Nothing is
    graded on the wrong calendar in either design; the difference is that this
    one does not also refuse the well-formed single-market claims.

# exactly zero the control arm produced `ci_low=None` everywhere, so the gate
# was neither passing nor failing on the basis it named — it was silent, and the
# architecture doc meanwhile described a "matched-control grading substrate" as a
# live capability. Whether an evaluation is matched-control is now POLICY, read
# from one governed table, never inferred from which rows happen to carry data.

    evidence clock at the first claim that is cohort-eligible AND control-carrying.

    Placed in the REGISTRAR, not in any producer, for one reason: a producer-side
    clock can be bypassed by wiring a second producer, and the whole contract
    rests on the clock being unbypassable. It runs over the NEWLY APPENDED rows
    only — never the whole store — so the cost is O(batch), not O(ledger).

    Every guard here is also a GATE-side cohort condition (C3.2), so the clock
    can never start on a claim the gate would refuse to count: family policy is
    `matched_control_required`, the row is live/open, directional, carries an
    explicit horizon unit and a VALID control leg (C2.2), and is prospective at
    registration. `benchmark_only` and `not_applicable` families never start a
    clock, whatever their rows carry (C1.4).

    THE CLOCK IS STAMPED WITH THE TRIGGERING CLAIM'S OWN `timestamp`, not with
    the moment this hook happens to run (review round 1, C3.4 amendment). The
    field is named `first_controlled_prospective_registration_utc` — so it must
    BE that registration's stamp. Writing `now()` instead placed the clock a few
    hundred microseconds AFTER every row in its own batch, and with the old
    instant-granularity C3.2(d) comparison that excluded the entire triggering
    batch from its own cohort: the reviewer's repro registered 5 rows, started
    the clock, and the gate then reported `n_cohort_rows=0`. The clock now sits
    exactly ON its trigger, and the gate compares at DATE granularity, so
    neither this nor batch ordering can shave rows out of the denominator.

    NEVER RAISES INTO REGISTRATION. A ledger write that a clock bookkeeping
    failure could abort would be a worse defect than the one this closes."""

    * `bench` defaults to the scope's default (SPY for non-macro). Macro callers
      MUST pass a named observable or register() rejects the claim (D4).
    * `control` defaults to the sector-matched ETF derived from `sector`.
    * `entry_levels` is assembled as {subject, bench} — the altdata PIT model,
      generalised (subject key == scope_key).
    * `horizon_unit` (P0a) DECLARES what the `horizon_d` number means:
      'trading_days' or 'calendar_days'. The number itself is never converted.
      Omitting it registers a LEGACY-clock claim graded by the pre-P0a calendar
      approximation — supported so unmigrated callers keep their exact behaviour,
      never as a silent declaration of either unit.
    * `check_by` is the claim's OWN resolved exit boundary, from the SAME
      `resolve_horizon_window` (and the same anchor, unit and market) the grader
      uses — so the deadline a human reads and the arithmetic the grade is
      measured with can no longer diverge as implementations. Legacy (unitless)
      claims keep the pre-P0a `asof + horizon_d business days` default untouched.

      EXACTLY WHAT THAT GUARANTEES, AND WHERE IT STOPS. `check_by` is resolved at
      the claim's OWN `horizon_d`; the grader grades at
      `in_scope_horizons(horizon_d)`. Those are the SAME date — check_by IS a
      graded exit, equal to some row's `clock_exit_date` — whenever
      `check_by_is_a_graded_exit(horizon_d)` holds, which as of P0b is every
      horizon_d at or below the ladder's ceiling (`GRADE_HORIZONS[-1]`, 63
      today): `in_scope_horizons` now always includes the claim's own ruler
      there, on-rung or off. It is NOT the same date only ABOVE that ceiling: a
      126-trading-day policy claim still grades at 5, 21 and 63 sessions while
      its check_by sits at session 126. The deadline is still a real, correctly
      resolved exchange exit under the declared unit — it is simply the
      claim's own horizon rather than a graded rung. Closing that remaining gap
      would mean extending `GRADE_HORIZONS` itself past 63d in the live nightly
      grader, which ruling LH-U6 (`config/ruling_graph.yml`) forbids; the
      predicate is exported so the scope is checkable instead of merely
      stated.

      A CALLER-SUPPLIED `check_by` DOES NOT OVERRIDE THE CLOCK. On a claim that
      DECLARES a unit, the resolver's exit always wins and the supplied value is
      preserved for audit as `check_by_source` (only when it disagrees). This is
      the difference between a contract and a convention: the two highest-volume
      US lanes — `scripts/backfill_qledger_us.py` `backfill_altdata` and
      `backfill_policy` — both pass a `check_by` read straight off their source
      thesis, and those values came from `ai_desk._check_by`, i.e. from
      `asof + BusinessDay(horizon)`: the very arithmetic P0a exists to replace,
      holiday-blind and anchored pre-embargo. Honouring them would have left the
      headline guarantee ("check_by IS the exit the grader resolves") with a
      bypass on exactly the lanes that carry the most claims. The alternative —
      validate and REFUSE on disagreement — was rejected: it would reject those
      lanes' entire output on day one, and a claim whose deadline is merely
      restated more precisely is not an invalid claim. Nothing is lost or
      hidden: the source's stated deadline stays on the row under
      `check_by_source`, so every overridden claim is countable in the store.
      Legacy (unitless) claims are untouched — a supplied value passes through
      exactly as before.

    is the close on the window's `coverage_date`, the last session the declared
    horizon contains. The window dates come from the resolver, never from this
    ticker's own index, so subject, bench and control are measured over the same
    declared horizon.

    RULE 5 IS ENFORCED HERE, NOT DESCRIBED. The two endpoint bars must be the

      * the first bar in [fill, exit] must BE `fill_date`, and
      * the last bar in [fill, exit] must BE `coverage_date`.

    An endpoint the store does not hold — a halt, an IPO that starts mid-window,
    a collection hole, a ticker delisted before the exit — used to be silently
    absorbed: the slice simply started later or ended earlier and a SHORTER
    window was graded under the declared horizon's label, differently for each
    leg. That is the exact failure the docstring promised against while maturity
    was checked somewhere else entirely (`_matured_window` asks `_covers`, which

    late start passes maturity and then grades short). Both endpoints are now
    asserted against the shared window, so a shortened window is REFUSED (None),
    never graded. Interior gaps do not matter: a two-endpoint total return reads
    only its endpoints (`lib.nyse_calendar` § GAP DISCIPLINE).

    NOT SILENT EITHER: a refused leg makes `grade_claim` return no row for that
    horizon, and `scripts/grade_qledger.py` counts exactly that outcome into
    `n_blocked_by_coverage` in `data/qledger/run_status.json` — so if this rule
    ever refuses at scale (a price store with widespread holes), the nightly
    summary shows it as a coverage number rather than as quietly missing grades.

    arithmetic byte-for-byte and its rows carry NO clock stamp — read as
    ``CLOCK_LEGACY``. Same stamped-discontinuity pattern, same law: legacy grades

# P0d — MATURITY-AWARE COHORT ACCOUNTING (review finding 4)
#
# THE PERVERSE INCENTIVE THIS KILLS. `grade_claim` rule 5 refuses the WHOLE grade
# row when a DECLARED control cannot price over the shared window (a control leg
# on a different window is not a null — see the rule-5 note above). So that claim
# produces NO ROW at that horizon, and `matched_control_check` counted its cohort
# from grade rows alone: the claim simply left the coverage denominator. Net
# effect: declaring an unpriceable control IMPROVED reported coverage versus
# declaring no control at all — no control leaves a row that counts as uncovered,
# an unpriceable control leaves nothing that counts as anything. A gate whose
# cheapest path to "covered" is to declare a control that cannot be measured is
# not a gate.
#
# The repair needs a reason, not a count: a cohort claim with no row at the
# evaluated horizon can be rowless because it has not matured, because its
# horizon never grades there at all, because the SUBJECT could not price, or
# because the CONTROL could not. Only the last one is a control refusal and only
# the last one joins the coverage denominator. `_cohort_rowless_class` answers
# that question with the SAME primitives `grade_claim` uses — one clock, reused,
# never re-derived — and short-circuits before any price read wherever it can.

    """(class, clock_basis) — WHY this cohort claim has no grade row at `horizon`.

    Every step mirrors `grade_claim` exactly, in `grade_claim`'s own order, so the
    answer is the real reason the grader wrote nothing rather than a second
    model of it. Returns the row's would-be `clock_basis` alongside the class
    (None when no window resolved), because a rowless claim on ANOTHER basis is
    not this basis's business.

    THE ORDER IS THE CONTRACT:

      1. embargo — a non-gradeable timestamp_quality never produces a row at all;
      2. `in_scope_horizons` — ESSENTIAL. A claim whose declared horizon never
         grades at the evaluated horizon is not a refusal of anything, and
         counting it would put claims into a denominator they can never leave
         (demand_chain declares 126 trading days and grades at 5/21/63);
      3/4. the window and its basis — no window is a fail-closed
         `window_unresolvable`, a different basis is simply not this evaluation;
      5. THE CALENDAR ALONE — `today < coverage_date` is the ONLY thing that
         makes a claim `not_yet_matured`. `_matured_window` conflates that with
         "a leg's series does not reach the close", so asking it here reported a
         permanently delisted subject as young forever (review round 1 defect 2,
         ported from #5661 after #5665 merged first);
      6. SUBJECT+BENCH, maturity and pricing together, on a window that HAS
         closed. `grade_claim` puts the control in the same `_matured_window`
         legs list, so an unpriceable control shows up there as "not matured" —
         indistinguishable from a young claim. Asking about the primary legs
         ALONE is what makes step 7 attributable: only once subject and bench
         are both measurable is a missing row the CONTROL's fault. A refusal
         here is the PRIMARY leg's and must not enter the coverage denominator
         (attributing a delisted subject to the control would manufacture a
         coverage failure out of a data gap);
      7. the control leg — matured and priceable, or `control_leg_refused`;
      8. otherwise the claim is fully gradeable and the grader has simply not run
         yet (`matured_awaiting_grading`) — a scheduling fact, NOT a refusal.

    while the v1 count climbs from 0 toward the 25-date bar. The path is
    monotone and finite. Authority is RESET by the basis change rather than
    inherited across it, which is the honest reading of a measurement-basis
    change — the alternative (pool, or ride whichever basis is bigger) launders
    59,326 legacy observations into a gate about a clock they were never measured
    on. NOT a trailing time window: a window that straddles the change still
    pools, and its length would be a free parameter nobody pre-registered.

    The rule is SELECT-AND-LABEL, never pool: the published cell is ONE basis's
    own honest numbers — `CLOCK_DISPLAY_SELECTION`, i.e. the basis with the most
    independent date clusters, ties broken toward the newer clock — carrying
    `clock_basis`, every basis present in `clock_bases`, `pooling_refused: True`,
    the named rule in `clock_basis_selection`, and EVERY basis's date count in
    `clock_bases_n_dates`. Nothing is summed across a measurement-basis change.

    DISCLOSED LIMITATION — the legacy basis will win for a long time. Selecting
    on sample size is deliberate for a display tier (the headline cell should be
    the largest honest sample, not the newest sliver), but with 59,326 legacy
    grade rows already in the store the legacy basis takes essentially every
    straddled cell until the explicit-clock corpus overtakes it, which is years
    of accrual at current volume. Correctly-clocked observations are therefore
    NOT the headline for those cells — but they are never invisible: their count
    sits in the same cell under `clock_bases_n_dates`, their full stats under
    ``track_record["by_clock_basis"]``, and the row split under
    ``counts.grades_by_clock_basis``. A reader who wants the new clock's numbers
    can always get them; a reader who reads only the headline is told, in the
    cell, that a bigger-but-older basis was chosen and how big the other one is.

    A TIE BETWEEN TWO MARKETS RESOLVES ALPHABETICALLY, not meaningfully. Now that
    the basis key carries the market, two EXPLICIT blocks (a US one and a CN one)
    can tie on n_dates and on the legacy/newer key; `compute_track_record` feeds
    the blocks in sorted-basis order and `max` keeps the first, so the CN block
    wins such a tie. That is deterministic (the published cell never depends on
    grade-row order) but it is NOT a judgement that CN is the better read — the
    other market's own numbers stay in `clock_bases_n_dates` and under
    ``by_clock_basis``, and a consumer that needs a specific market must name it.

    Display selects; AUTHORITY does the opposite — `promotion_check` evaluates
    inside the EXPLICIT basis via `_authority_clock_basis` and ignores the legacy
    pile entirely, because a gate may not ride the sample size of a clock it is
    not gating on.

class PromotionResult:
    """Outcome of a promotion_check() call.

    Attributes:
        eligible:       True if the §3 gate would permit promotion to CONFIRMER.
        reason:         Human-readable explanation of the gate result.
        n_dates:        Number of independent date clusters in the grade set.
        wilson_ci_low:  Wilson CI lower bound (None if n_dates == 0).
        current_state:  derive_state() chip value, EXCEPT that a legacy-only
                        basis reaching GRADED territory reads
                        STATE_LEGACY_NOT_AUTHORITY_ELIGIBLE instead of
                        STATE_GRADED (P0c-2, CEO ruling 2026-08-13 §5) — the
                        one deliberate override of the plain n_dates chip.
        demote:         True if the rolling CI has gone negative — auto-demote is warranted.
        pinned_reason:  Suggested pin reason string (mirrors narrative_regime precedent).
        clock_basis:    (P0a) the ONE grading-clock basis this verdict was computed
                        on. None when no basis could be chosen (the family mixes two
                        EXPLICIT bases) or when there are no rows to evaluate. Any
                        consumer reporting these numbers must report this alongside
                        them — the same n_dates means different things on different
                        clocks.
        clock_migration: (P0a) True while this verdict's `n_dates` is SMALLER
                        than the largest excluded basis's own n_dates — i.e.
                        while there is a drop to explain, and the drop is a clock
                        migration rather than a performance collapse. It is False
                        for a family that never straddled, AND for one that has
                        finished migrating: the flag CLEARS as soon as the count
                        on the corrected clock reaches the excluded history it
                        replaced. It is not "this family has any old rows" —
                        that condition never clears, and a banner that never
                        clears says nothing.

                        (round 5, MAJOR 3) It is ALSO False for a family in
                        `STATE_MIXED_CLOCK` — a family that has genuinely
                        started accruing on two EXPLICIT bases at once (two
                        markets, most often). That is not a migration: there is
                        no single corrected clock this family is converging
                        toward, both bases keep accruing forever, and a flag
                        that would never clear is not disclosure, it is a
                        permanently false "re-accruing" sentence. Read
                        `current_state` to tell the two apart:
                        `STATE_MIXED_CLOCK` + `clock_migration=False` is a
                        stable multi-basis split (promote each basis by name,
                        `promotion_check_by_market`); `clock_migration=True`
                        (any other state) is a one-time, terminating
                        legacy->explicit changeover.
        clock_prior_n_dates: {basis -> its own n_dates} for every basis this
                        verdict is NOT counting toward its headline —whether
                        excluded (a migration) or simply the OTHER market in a
                        MIXED_CLOCK split — so a consumer can say "1 date on
                        the corrected clock; the 40 dates it had were measured
                        on the old one" (migration) or "26 dates on US; 26 on
                        CN, neither summed" (split) instead of showing a bare
                        number with no context. Populated whenever another
                        basis exists, INCLUDING after `clock_migration` has
                        cleared and for a MIXED_CLOCK split (where it is never
                        going to clear) — this is a fact about the verdict,
                        not gated on the flag.
        migration_note: one plain sentence a surface can render as-is; empty
                        string exactly when `clock_migration` is False —
                        including the MIXED_CLOCK case, where `reason` already
                        carries the (different, accurate) prose.

    WHY THIS EXISTS. `_authority_clock_basis` resets authority at a basis change
    — the right call, and the CEO's explicit ruling (do NOT pool bases). But the
    reset is instantaneous and total: the night the first explicit-clock grade
    lands for an already-promoted family, this object flips from
    GRADED/n_dates=40 to ACCRUING/n_dates=1 with nothing on it saying why. A
    reader — or the admin Experiments tab, or a readiness alert — cannot tell
    that apart from a family whose evidence evaporated. The numbers stay exactly
    as the ruling requires; what is added is the reason they moved.

    P0d — THE EVIDENCE BASIS TRAVELS WITH THE VERDICT (C5.4). Four concepts stay
    separate on every rendered surface (C6.1): benchmark-relative evidence,
    matched-control evidence, control coverage, and authority eligibility. So a
    verdict now says which basis produced it (`evidence_basis` ∈ matched_control
    | benchmark | not_applicable, plus the `unclassified` flag for a family
    absent from the governed policy table), and a matched-control verdict carries
    the coverage accounting it was reached under: `n_cohort_dates` (independent
    date clusters over ALL prospective cohort members at this horizon/basis),
    `n_controlled_dates` (the same count over members carrying a valid control),
    `control_coverage` (their ratio), the row-count pair `n_cohort_rows` /
    `n_controlled_rows`, and `control_clock_start` (when this family's
    matched-control evidence began accruing — None while it has not). The
    headline `n_dates` of a matched-control verdict IS `n_controlled_dates`: the
    Wilson interval is projected onto the controlled count only (C4.3), never
    onto the full family's, so a rate measured on 37 rows can never be stated at
    a 100-row N. Every field defaults to None/False, so a benchmark verdict is
    unchanged in shape and no consumer has to know about P0d to keep working.

    P0d REVIEW FINDING 4 — MATURITY-AWARE COHORT ACCOUNTING. A cohort claim whose
    DECLARED control cannot price over the shared window produces NO grade row at
    all (`grade_claim` rule 5 refuses the row rather than nulling the leg), so it
    used to leave the coverage denominator entirely — which made declaring an
    unpriceable control strictly BETTER for reported coverage than declaring no
    control at all. Those claims now rejoin the denominator as uncovered members,
    and the verdict discloses both the size of that set
    (`n_control_refused_rows` / `n_control_refused_dates`) and the full reason
    census of every rowless cohort claim (`cohort_rowless`: `not_yet_matured`,
    `primary_leg_refused`, `horizon_out_of_scope`, `other_basis`, …). ONLY
    `control_leg_refused` enters a denominator; the rest are disclosed precisely
    so a young cohort can be told apart from a broken one without either being
    silently converted into a coverage number.

    """Evaluate the §3 promotion gate for a claim_family at a given horizon.

    §3 gate (SHADOW → CONFIRMER):
      1. n_dates >= 25 (independent date clusters, the honest n [P1])
      2. Wilson-CI lower bound of the excess hit-rate > 0.5 at the claim's
         horizon. The bound is a PROPORTION, so 0.5 — the coin-flip null — is
         the bar; the old `> 0` was cleared by a single hit.
      3. Rolling check: if wilson_ci_low <= 0.5 on the trailing window → demote.

    P0d — WHICH EXCESS LEG THE GATE READS IS NOW A POLICY DISPATCH, NOT THIS
    FUNCTION'S `control_only` FLAG. §3 used to be described here as "vs matched
    control" unconditionally, which was never true of the code (the flag decided)
    and is no longer true of the contract. `promotion_check_dispatch` routes by
    the family's `FAMILY_CONTROL_POLICY` entry: a `matched_control_required`
    family is evaluated by `matched_control_check` (matched-control leg, with
    coverage), and a `benchmark_only`/unclassified family by THIS function on its
    benchmark leg (`control_only=False`) — which is what every production path
    now calls it with. `control_only=True` survives for direct/research callers
    and is documented as subset-projecting (census D0-3); nothing in production
    passes it. See research/PREREG_P0D_MATCHED_CONTROL_CONTRACT.md.

    The block-bootstrap stability check (§3: "across date clusters") and the
    incremental-information check ("incremental over price+VIX baseline") are
    noted in the result but their implementation is deferred to the W6 composite
    validator — this function gates on the two hard numeric criteria.

    P0a — THE GATE EVALUATES INSIDE EXACTLY ONE GRADING-CLOCK BASIS, and never
    pools two. When a family's rows straddle the legacy and explicit clocks, the
    gate counts ONLY the explicit-clock rows (`_authority_clock_basis`): the
    legacy pile is neither pooled in nor allowed to carry the family over the
    bar, and the family's authority accrues from zero on the clock it is now
    measured on. That is a TERMINATING migration — see `_authority_clock_basis`
    for why the first cut (refuse every straddled family) was not. A family
    mixing two EXPLICIT bases at one horizon is genuinely ambiguous and is still
    refused as `STATE_MIXED_CLOCK`.

    P0c-2 — CEO ruling 2026-08-13 §5: EVEN WHEN a legacy-only basis is the ONE
    basis a family holds (today, every live family — no explicit-clock grade
    row exists yet), it may not INDEPENDENTLY produce `eligible=True`. The
    numbers still compute and still publish (n_dates, wilson_ci_low, the reason
    string); only the verdict is withdrawn — see
    `STATE_LEGACY_NOT_AUTHORITY_ELIGIBLE`. This does not change straddled-family
    behaviour above: a family holding legacy + exactly one explicit basis still
    evaluates and promotes on the explicit basis alone, unaffected.

    Args:
        claim_family: The `claim_family` tag (matches qledger claims.jsonl rows).
        horizon:      The horizon_d to check (typically 5, 21, or 63).
        root:         Repo root; defaults to config.ROOT.
        control_only: When True, evaluate excess vs control_ret rather than bench.
                      §3 specifies "vs matched control" as the gate leg.
        clock_basis:  Evaluate on THIS `grade_clock_basis` value explicitly (e.g.
                      to ask what the legacy history said). Default None selects
                      per `_authority_clock_basis`.

    Returns:

    """P0a MAJOR 2 (round 5) — PROMOTION, REACHABLE PER MARKET, FROM PRODUCTION.

    `promotion_check`'s default resolves via `_authority_clock_basis`, which
    answers None for a family holding two or more EXPLICIT bases (a family
    that has genuinely started accruing on two markets) — that is the correct,
    deliberate refusal to pool. `promotion_check(..., clock_basis=...)` CAN
    promote such a family per market, but nothing in the only two production
    call paths that reach `promotion_check` (`emit_ladder_states`,
    `scripts.grade_qledger.compute_promotion_readiness`) ever names one, so a
    bi-market family was unreachable for promotion through any path a nightly
    run actually takes — reachable in principle, never in practice.

    Call this with the STATE_MIXED_CLOCK `PromotionResult` `promotion_check`
    just returned (`mixed`); it re-evaluates the SAME family/horizon once per
    EXPLICIT basis that result's own `clock_prior_n_dates` discloses (the
    disclosure IS the enumeration), NEVER pooling any two of them. Returns
    `{}` when `mixed` was not actually a MIXED_CLOCK verdict (nothing to
    re-evaluate — the default already named the one basis that matters).

    THE LEGACY BASIS IS ENUMERATED BUT NEVER RE-EVALUATED. `clock_prior_n_dates`
    discloses every basis a family holds, `CLOCK_LEGACY` included — that
    disclosure is deliberate and stays. Feeding it back into `promotion_check`
    is a different act: it would mint a real, per-basis PROMOTION VERDICT on
    the legacy grading basis and publish it into `track_record.json`
    (`ladder_states.<fam>.<h>.by_clock_basis`), where a `GRADED` cell reads as
    authority earned. `_authority_clock_basis` already refuses exactly this for
    the default path ("legacy + one v1 -> the v1 basis; legacy rows are not
    counted"), and the whole point of the P0a contract is that a
    measurement-basis change RESETS authority rather than carrying it across.
    So the per-market escape hatch inherits that rule instead of quietly
    routing around it: authority is evaluated only inside an explicit basis.

    Not reachable on today's corpus — no explicit-clock grade row exists yet, so
    nothing can be STATE_MIXED_CLOCK — but it becomes reachable the first night
    a second market accrues, which is precisely when a legacy `GRADED` cell
    would appear beside the real ones. Pinned by

    Such a family's AUTHORITY BASIS IS THE MATCHED CONTROL. This returns
    eligible=True only when ALL of the following hold on ONE explicit clock basis:
      * the family's control evidence clock has started (C3.1);
      * `control_coverage >= CONTROL_COVERAGE_MIN` (0.95) — C4.2, where coverage
        is `min(date-cluster coverage, ROW coverage)` (amended review round 1);
      * `n_controlled_dates >= PROMOTION_MIN_DATES` (25) — C4.1/C5.1;
      * Wilson `ci_low > PROMOTION_MIN_CI_LOW` (0.5) on CONTROLLED rows only,
        direction-correct per P0c-1's rule (strict inequality; `direction=0` and
        missing legs excluded from numerator AND denominator).

    REVIEW ROUND 1 (2026-08-14) closed two ways the accounting could be gamed
    without anyone lying: cohort membership compared registration stamps at
    INSTANT granularity, so a batch's own clock excluded the batch and sort order
    decided who stayed in the denominator; and coverage was a DATE ratio, so one
    controlled row per day covered an arbitrarily large uncovered book. Both are
    fixed at the point of measurement below, and both are pinned by mutation
    controls in tests/test_qledger_control_policy.py.

    THERE IS NO BENCH FALLBACK, UNDER ANY DATA CONDITION (adversarial control
    #1). A required family whose bench-relative record would sail past the bar
    still refuses while its controls are missing — that is the entire point of
    the classification. Its benchmark-relative statistics remain computed and
    published as the labelled BASELINE by the track-record/readiness paths; they
    simply can never produce `ready=True` for it.

    TWO THINGS THIS FIXES THAT `promotion_check(control_only=True)` GOT WRONG:

    1. THE DENOMINATOR (census D0-3). The old path computed the control-only hit
       RATE over rows carrying control legs and then projected it onto `n_dates`
       counted over the WHOLE family — stating a Wilson interval at full-cohort N
       for a rate measured on a subset. With 37 controlled rows in a 100-row
       cohort it published an n=100 interval. Here the projection is onto
       `n_controlled_dates` and nothing else (C4.3), and the issued cohort stays
       VISIBLE: missing-control rows can never leave the denominator of coverage
       (adversarial control #6).

    2. THE COHORT (C3.2/C3.3). Evidence is PROSPECTIVE-ONLY. A claim joins the
       cohort only if it is directional, declares an explicit horizon unit, was
       registered at or after the clock start, and was forward-looking AT ITS OWN
       REGISTRATION STAMP (`_cohort_prospective`). So a later import of old-asof
       rows — even perfectly controlled ones — can never join the cohort, start
       the clock, or enter the N. Historical rows are untouched, never
       backfilled, never combined with cohort evidence.

    REVIEW FINDING 4 (2026-08-14) closed the third: A DECLARED CONTROL THAT
    CANNOT PRICE USED TO IMPROVE COVERAGE. `grade_claim`'s rule 5 refuses the
    whole grade row when the control leg cannot be measured over the shared
    window, and this function counted its cohort from GRADE ROWS — so that claim
    left the denominator entirely, while a claim declaring NO control left a row
    that counted as uncovered. Declaring an unpriceable control was therefore
    strictly better for reported coverage than declaring none. Cohort claims with
    no row are now CLASSIFIED (`_cohort_rowless_class`) and the
    `control_leg_refused` ones REJOIN the coverage denominator as uncovered
    members. Nothing else does: `not_yet_matured` is a young claim,
    `primary_leg_refused` is the subject's data gap, `horizon_out_of_scope` can
    never grade here at all, and attributing any of them to the control would
    manufacture a coverage failure out of an unrelated fact. The numerators and
    the Wilson arithmetic are UNCHANGED (C4.3, controlled rows only), so this can
    only LOWER a coverage number, never raise one.

    Refusals NAME their failing clause and print both date counts and the
    coverage. `clock_basis` names ONE basis explicitly (the per-market escape
    hatch, mirroring `promotion_check`'s parameter of the same name). `today`
    exists so the maturity half of the rowless classification is deterministic in
    tests; it defaults to `date.today()`, the same default `grade_claim` uses.
