"""engine.neuralweb.half_life — W2 "Measured Half-Lives" (Signal Commons program).

HONESTY HEADER
--------------
This module is DISPLAY-ONLY.  It measures holding-horizon decay curves from
the kernel_estimates.parquet and spine_index.parquet, and writes a per-family
half-life artifact.  Zero behavior-changing consumers may read the output until
a separately gated change proposes it.

BLOCKER RE-SCOPE (from Fable pre-reg review)
--------------------------------------------
B1 — "age-at-fire vs realized excess" is UNBUILDABLE from the current spine
     index (no signal-age column).  W2 is RE-SCOPED to "holding-horizon decay":
     does shrunken_ic peak and then decay as the holding period grows?

B2 — Exponential / power-law half-life is ill-posed when the curve RISES.
     track_record shrunken_ic {5:0.0487, 10:0.0573, 21:0.0717, 63:0.1112,
     126:0.1578} is monotonically INCREASING.  A pre-registered monotone-
     decrease gate is applied first; a rising curve emits half_life=None.

B3 — outcome_excess unit incommensurability: track_record outcome_excess is
     a non-negative magnitude (0% negatives); radar outcome_excess is a signed
     excess (≈45% negatives).  outcome_unit is mandatory in the schema.
     The unit is now derived STRUCTURALLY from the spine index's outcome_basis
     column (query.OUTCOME_BASIS_FOR_LEDGER) with _OUTCOME_UNIT_MAP as the
     fallback — the hand-maintained map had no board entries, so hk_board /
     ca_board / cn_board silently defaulted to 'signed_excess' despite using
     the same unsigned fwd_mfe proxy as track_record.
     cf. PR #4673 edge_outcomes.py dst_outcome_unsigned_mfe_proxy.

B4 — Insufficient horizon points: radar has only h=5 graded rows; us_board
     only h=5,10.  Both are CLASS-B (< 3 admissible horizons → NaN always).

STALENESS HALF-LIFE (decay_kind='staleness')
--------------------------------------------
Measured per family when data/replay/replay_delay.parquet is present
(Mac-local; never in git per EI R9). Coverage stamp (which years/families)
is included in the artifact.

Per-family fitter (staleness path):
  - Input: replay_delay.parquet rows for this family
    (family_key matched against replay_boarded.parquet tier_cascade / via
    a direct lookup where episode_id/signal_date groups map to families).
    Currently the replay fires do not carry a kernel family tag — the fitter
    operates on the FULL fire population (no family split) and is labelled
    "__fires__" family key to be explicit.
  - Measurement: mean fwd_ret_21 (and MAE = mean fwd_mdd_21) by delay_n,
    restricted to horizon_censored=False, survivor_bias=False rows (era law).
  - Monotone-decrease check on mean fwd_ret_21 vs delay_n (same HAC-t–gated
    negative-slope gate as the CLASS-A horizon fitter — numpy only, no scipy).
  - Exponential fit: mirroring the CLASS-A functional form (y = A·exp(-d/τ));
    numpy-only least-squares via log-linear regression (no scipy, matching
    the "reuse validation.py primitives — numpy only" spec requirement).
  - Gate: negative slope significant at HAC/Newey-West t > 1.96.
    HAC-t is computed from OLS residuals on the log-linear form with NW
    standard errors (numpy only, 1-lag Bartlett kernel per spec).
  - Passing families report staleness_half_life in days-late (τ·ln2).
  - Failing families print an HONEST NULL (the W2 pattern).

Coverage stamp: when the artifact is absent (CI runners, no replay_delay.parquet)
the module degrades gracefully to the current "UNMEASURED" declaration — no crash.
The honesty header is updated to reflect which state applies.

ESTIMATOR CLASSES
-----------------
CLASS-A: deep archive, ≥5 horizon points, any outcome_unit.
  Gate: Spearman(horizon, shrunken_ic) over __all__ marginal cells.
  If monotone-DECREASING (rho < 0 AND every step ≤ 0 within CI):
    fit y = A·exp(-h/τ) by WNLS on shrunken_ic; half_life = τ·ln2.
  If flat or rising: half_life = None, reason = "edge_non_decaying" — PLUS the
    measured curve-shape facts (audit fix): trend='non_decaying',
    ic_ratio_long_short = IC(longest h)/IC(shortest h), and fit_direction
    ('rising'/'flat'/'non_monotone' from Spearman rho). A rising curve is a
    useful fact, not a bare null: e.g. track_record shrunken_ic RISES 5d
    0.0487 → 126d 0.1578 (ratio ≈ 3.24x).

CLASS-B: < 3 admissible graded horizons → half_life = None always.

CLASS-C: zero graded outcomes → half_life = None, "unmeasured (no graded outcomes yet)".

N-FLOORS (pre-registered)
--------------------------
- Per-cell floor: WILSON_MIN_N = 12 (n_eff per horizon point to be admissible).
- Curve floor: ≥ 3 admissible horizon points required to attempt a fit.
- Family floor: total graded n_eff ≥ 200.

UNCERTAINTY
-----------
For any family that does pass the gate (currently none): block-bootstrap over
(symbol, as_of) events, 200 resamples, 90th-percentile CI [ci_low, ci_high].
If CI spans a sign change or is unbounded → NaN.

CONSERVATIVE DEFAULTS TAKEN
----------------------------
- family_floor N = 200 (flagged)
- curve_floor ≥ 3 horizon points
- per-cell floor = WILSON_MIN_N = 12
- bootstrap 90th-percentile, 200 resamples, event-block
- column named "family_half_life" in the row-stamp docstring to prevent
  future misreading, but written under the COLUMNS key "half_life" (W1 contract)
- monotone-decrease is a HARD pre-registered gate (rising → NaN)

OPEN QUESTIONS (flagged, not acted on)
---------------------------------------
- B1 is the gating decision: W2 is re-scoped to holding-horizon; staleness
  is declared unmeasured and registered as a W0-blocked item.
- track_record outcome_excess is a non-negative magnitude, not signed edge;
  the honest expected outcome of W2 is all-null.
- Row-level stamp: "half_life" matches the W1 slot name; column semantics
  are family-level constants broadcast to rows (a future consumer risk).
  Flagged in notes; a separate gated change would rename if needed.
- Staleness half-life blocked on fill_offset variation (currently uniform=1);
  needs delayed-fill accrual in the replay harness.

    Degrades gracefully when the artifact is absent (CI runners):
    returns an unmeasured declaration with a coverage stamp explaining why.

    Spec requirements (nwqs_spec_d.md §2):
    - Per family: mean fwd_ret_21 (and MAE = -mean(fwd_mdd_21)) by delay_n
    - Monotone-decrease check on mean fwd_ret_21 vs delay_n
    - Exponential fit mirroring CLASS-A form; gate = negative slope
      significant at HAC/Newey-West t; numpy only, no scipy
    - Passing families: staleness_half_life in days-late (tau * ln2)
    - Failing families: HONEST NULL (W2 pattern)
    - Coverage stamp: which years/families are covered

    Returns a dict keyed by family_key (currently "__fires__" for the full
    population; future waves can split by tier_cascade or engine family).
