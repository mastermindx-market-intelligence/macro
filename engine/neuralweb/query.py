"""engine.neuralweb.query — The spine QUERY LAYER (Neural Web W2 PR1).

READ-SIDE ONLY: one place answering "what did any engine claim, and what
happened?" across every graded ledger in the Macro Dashboard suite.

FEDERATION NOT MIGRATION
------------------------
No source ledger is modified.  qledger is joined read-only via claim_id.
The substrate ruling (qledger → spine promotion) remains OPEN pending the
joint QI co-sign.  Both sequencing escape hatches verified by scout
(data/neuralweb/w2_scout.json):
  - W6 promotion monitor has NOT fired (n_families_ready=0; earliest
    projection 2026-08-29).
  - qledger semantics frozen since #1180; only post-#1180 change is the
    numpy coerce hotfix (#1225 — no schema change).

DOUBLE-COUNT PREVENTION
-----------------------
``adapt_spine()`` skips altdata_conv rows ONLY when a qledger twin exists
for the same (symbol, as_of) — i.e. event-matched exclusion, not blanket
engine exclusion.  ``build_index`` computes the qledger frame first, derives
the altdata twin key set (frozenset of (symbol, as_of) for desk='altdata'
claims), then passes it to ``adapt_spine(twin_keys=...)``.

Called standalone (``adapt_spine()`` without twin_keys), no altdata_conv
rows are excluded — the caller has no qledger context.

The real-world correspondence: spine has 134 altdata_conv rows; qledger has
133 desk='altdata' claims (one-to-one match for 133 events).  The 1 orphan
(BWXT@2026-07-02) has NO qledger twin and is retained with ledger='spine'.
Today it is ungraded so calibration-inert, but a future graded orphan would
otherwise silently vanish from the W3 calibration index.

engine='desk:ai_desk' rows are intentionally NOT excluded — they have no
qledger twin family and no dedicated adapter.

PIT CORRECTNESS FOR GRADED_AT
------------------------------
``data/spine/predictions.parquet`` carries ``graded_at`` as a column that
is NULL for every row in the current build (0 of 1086 rows populated),
including all 952 rows with ``outcome_graded=True``.  Because the graded_at
timestamp cannot be known from the spine parquet alone, ``adapt_spine()``
backfills it from ``as_of + horizon`` calendar days for graded rows — a
conservative lower bound (the grade could not have been computed before the
horizon elapsed).

``query(graded_before=cutoff)`` enforces: rows with ``outcome_graded=True``
AND ``graded_at`` still null (i.e. graded-but-timestampless, which can only
happen if the adapter backfill was bypassed) are EXCLUDED from the result.
This is the safe direction for PIT replay — a graded row with no timestamp
is a look-ahead hazard, not a pre-cutoff observation.  Ungraded rows
(``outcome_graded=False``) with null graded_at are retained (they have not
yet been graded; they are legitimately pre-cutoff candidates).

CANONICAL COLUMNS
-----------------
Every row in the materialized index carries::

    signal_id, engine, family, ledger, as_of, symbol, scope_type,
    universe, horizon, direction, size_binding, fill_basis, score,
    outcome_excess, outcome_graded, graded_at, outcome_basis,
    terminal_state_clean15_126, terminal_state_clean8_21,
    fwd_mfe_5, fwd_mfe_10, fwd_mfe_21, fwd_mfe_63, fwd_mfe_126,
    rate_pressure, quad_hard_label, fused_risk_label, vol_regime,
    risk_radar_state, vector_asof, species_id, archetype

Missing fields per source = NaN/None (honest sparsity, never fabricated).
``fill_basis`` preserves provenance (e.g. "t1_hl2" for CN, "next_bar" for
US/HK/CA post Stage B-e, "asof_legacy" for older qledger rows).
``ledger`` is a source enum:
  spine, track_record, board_hk, board_ca, board_cn, qledger,
  cycles_us, cycles_china, cycles_country
``scope_type`` domain: 'entity' | 'basket' are produced by current data;
  'sector' | 'macro' are reserved for future adapters — no current qledger
  rows produce them.

OUTCOME BASIS — what ``outcome_excess`` ACTUALLY measures per ledger
--------------------------------------------------------------------
``outcome_excess`` is NOT one quantity.  Four ledgers fill it from a forward
MAXIMUM-FAVORABLE-EXCURSION column (``fwd_mfe_<h>``), which is unsigned BY
CONSTRUCTION — an MFE cannot be negative, so "excess > 0" on those rows means
"the name traded above entry at least once in the window", not "the call was
directionally right".  Those adapters also pin ``direction=1``, so every
sign-based statistic over them is a tautology.

``outcome_basis`` is the structural cure: a per-row label naming the semantic
of that row's ``outcome_excess``.

  ``signed_excess``       real signed excess return; sign carries information.
                          Ledgers: spine, qledger.
  ``unsigned_mfe_proxy``  forward MFE used as an outcome proxy — magnitude only,
                          never negative, sign tests VACUOUS.
                          Ledgers: track_record, board_hk, board_ca, board_cn.
  ``synthetic_sign_stub`` ±0.01 SIGN PLACEHOLDER: the sign is real (directional
                          hit/miss), the magnitude is fabricated and must never
                          feed a return or volatility calculation.
                          Ledger: cortex_attention.
  ``None``                ledger carries no outcome (outcome_excess is always
                          null): cycles_*, reflexes, options_entry, tech_signals,
                          macro_context, personality_context — and any ledger
                          not explicitly mapped (fail-closed).

Measured on the committed index 2026-08-05: track_record 288,884 graded rows,
min 0.0, 0.0% negative, 13.2% exactly zero; board_hk 509 rows 0.0% negative;
board_ca 330 rows 0.0% negative; board_cn 0 graded rows today but structurally
identical (same fwd_mfe proxy).  By contrast qledger 12,770 rows are 52.8%
negative and spine 2,436 rows are 41.7% negative — genuinely signed.

CONSUMER RULE (the whole point of the column): treat ONLY
``outcome_basis == 'signed_excess'`` as a signed excess return.  Anything else
— including ``None`` and any unknown value — is NOT sign-safe: direction
agreement, hit rates, Wilson CIs on directional accuracy, and co-firing lift
are all undefined against it.  Magnitude statistics (means, variances, decay
curves) remain defined for ``unsigned_mfe_proxy`` provided they are LABELLED
as magnitudes, never described as edge or accuracy.
cf. PR #4673 engine/neuralweb/edge_outcomes.py ``dst_outcome_unsigned_mfe_proxy``.

ADAPTERS (one per source — all fail-open)
-----------------------------------------
a) adapt_spine()         → ledger='spine'
b) adapt_track_record()  → ledger='track_record' (data/signal_archive/; fail-open: absent on fresh clone)
c) adapt_board('hk')     → ledger='board_hk'
d) adapt_board('ca')     → ledger='board_ca'
e) adapt_china_board()   → ledger='board_cn'
f) adapt_qledger()       → ledger='qledger'  (claims⋈grades join, read-only)
g) adapt_forward_logs()  → ledger='cycles_*' (only graded rows)

BUILD IDIOM
-----------
``write_index(root)`` is the single nightly entry point.  It is a FULL
REBUILD (idempotent) — the index is a derived view, not a forward ledger, so
there is no ledger-law tension from overwriting.  ``load_index(root)``
reads the parquet.  ``query(...)`` filters in-memory (fast at today's ~5 MB
scale).

PIT GUARD (documented for callers)
-----------------------------------
``query(..., as_of_before=date)`` retains rows with ``as_of < date``; call
this to restrict to signals that EXISTED before a cutoff.  Outcomes on those
rows were graded AFTER ``as_of``; PIT-correct backtest replay MUST also
supply ``graded_before=date`` to restrict to knowledge state at cutoff.  See
``query()`` docstring.

    The spine parquet is the canonical carrier for the us_board + 7 desk
    adapters.  Do NOT re-adapt those sources directly — that would double-count
    rows already in the spine.

    DOUBLE-COUNT GUARD (event-matched): engine='altdata_conv' rows are skipped
    ONLY when ``twin_keys`` contains (symbol, as_of) — meaning a qledger twin
    exists for that event.  Orphan altdata_conv rows (no qledger twin) are
    retained with ledger='spine' so they are not silently dropped from the
    calibration index.

    ``twin_keys`` is a frozenset of (symbol, as_of) tuples built from
    qledger desk='altdata' claims by ``build_index``.  When ``twin_keys`` is
    None (standalone call), no altdata_conv rows are excluded.

    engine='desk:ai_desk' rows are intentionally NOT excluded — they have no
    qledger twin family and no dedicated adapter.

    GRADED_AT BACKFILL: data/spine/predictions.parquet carries graded_at=null
    for every row (0 of 1086 populated in the current build).  For rows with
    outcome_graded=True, this adapter synthesises graded_at = as_of + horizon
    calendar days as a conservative lower bound.  This prevents the query
    layer's graded_before filter from being a no-op for the entire spine ledger
    (which would be a silent PIT look-ahead leak).

    JOIN KEY: claim_id.
    GRADE HORIZONS: contract is (5, 21, 63) — no 10d or 126d rows exist in
    qledger; those fwd_mfe cells stay NaN in the index.  Current graded data
    is horizon=5 only (1088/1088 graded rows are h=5); h=21 and h=63 are
    contract-reserved but not yet populated.

    FILL CONVENTION: pre-Stage B-e rows carry fill_convention absent or
    "asof_legacy"; post-Stage B-e rows carry "next_bar".  The fill_basis
    column preserves this distinction so callers never pool conventions.

    REGIME STAMPS: written at claim registration time by
    engine/qledger.py:_regime_stamp_for_asof.  However, the real claims.jsonl
    data (7937 rows as of this build) does NOT carry regime fields at the top
    level or nested — all 7937 rows have null rate_pressure / quad_hard_label /
    fused_risk_label / vol_regime / risk_radar_state.  The adapter reads these
    keys defensively (claim.get(k) → null if absent) and carries the nulls
    honestly.  Consequence: query(regime=...) never matches any qledger row;
    regime-conditioned calibration against qledger is a functional gap until the
    claims store is backfilled.  Not data corruption — honest nulls.

    Qledger substrate ruling: READ-ONLY join pending joint QI co-sign.
    signal_id namespace: 'qledger:<claim_id>:<grade_horizon>' — never
    collides with spine or board namespaces.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df:
        Pre-loaded frame.  If None, ``load_index(root)`` is called.
    engine:
        Filter by engine name (exact match).
    family:
        Filter by family name (exact match).
    ledger:
        Filter by ledger enum value (exact match).
    regime:
        Filter by regime label.  Matches against quad_hard_label OR
        fused_risk_label OR vol_regime OR risk_radar_state (any match
        qualifies the row).  Default (None) returns all rows (no filter).
        Note: ``regime='pit_live'`` is NOT a valid label — pit_live is a
        stamp BASIS, not a regime label; use ``stamp_basis='pit_live'``
        for that filter.
    horizon:
        Filter by horizon (int, exact).
    symbol:
        Filter by symbol (exact).
    scope_type:
        Filter by scope_type (entity | sector | basket | macro).
    macro_context_id:
        R5 — filter by macro_context_id (sha256[:16] of macro label composite).
        Returns only rows stamped with this specific snapshot id.
    stamp_basis:
        R5 — filter by regime_stamp_basis.

        Interaction with ``regime``::

            regime=X, stamp_basis=None     → restrict regime match to pit_live rows
                                             (callers opt out via stamp_basis='any')
            regime=X, stamp_basis='any'    → no basis restriction (all rows)
            regime=X, stamp_basis='pit_live'            → pit_live rows only
            regime=X, stamp_basis='recomputed_history'  → reconstructed rows only
            regime=None, stamp_basis='pit_live'         → pit_live rows (any regime)
            regime=None, stamp_basis=None  → no basis filter

        When regime is None, stamp_basis=None applies no basis filter.
    as_of_before:
        PIT guard — retain rows where as_of < cutoff (ISO date str).
        These rows EXISTED before the cutoff; their outcomes were graded AFTER.
        For a PIT-correct backtest replaying knowledge state at cutoff, ALSO
        supply ``graded_before`` to restrict to what was KNOWN at cutoff.
    graded_before:
        PIT knowledge-state guard — retain rows where graded_at < cutoff.
        Use in tandem with as_of_before for PIT-correct backtest replay.

        Null-graded_at handling (two cases):
        - ``outcome_graded=False`` (ungraded): retained.  These rows existed
          before the cutoff and have not yet been graded; they are legitimately
          pre-cutoff candidates.
        - ``outcome_graded=True`` (graded, but timestamp absent): EXCLUDED.
          A graded row with no timestamp cannot be placed on the timeline;
          retaining it is a look-ahead hazard.  Adapters must supply
          graded_at for graded rows (adapt_spine() backfills as_of+horizon;
          other adapters read graded_at from the source record).

        Note: ``graded_only=True`` additionally removes all ungraded rows
        regardless of their graded_at.
    graded_only:
        If True, only retain rows with outcome_graded == True.

    GRADING DESIGN — UNGRADED-HONEST
    ---------------------------------
    All reflex firings ship as ``outcome_graded=False``.  Reflexes are
    operational event records, not calibrated forward-return predictions.
    Grading design is documented as future work:

      - Infrastructure reflexes (e.g. regime_stale_selfheal, circuit_breaker_trip):
        direction=0, ungradeable by design.  Even if a grading study were
        desired, the relevant outcome would be operational (did the engine catch
        up?) not a financial return.

      - Signal reflexes (e.g. commodity_shock, btc_flash_crash): direction
        carried from the event (±1); a forward-return study could in principle
        be pre-registered against a commodity ETF / BTC bench.  That study is
        DEFERRED to a post-W6 gauntlet.  No grading is fabricated here.

    The ``outcome_graded=False`` path in the spine query layer's graded_before
    filter retains these rows correctly as "legitimately pre-cutoff candidates"
    (they existed before the cutoff and have not yet been graded).

    SCOPE TYPE MAPPING
    ------------------
    Firing records carry ``scope_type`` from the event payload.  Accepted values:
    'macro', 'entity', 'sector', 'basket'.  Anything else is normalised to 'macro'.
