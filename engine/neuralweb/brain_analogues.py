"""engine.neuralweb.brain_analogues — US historical-analogue retrieval for the brain.

CLASSIFICATION: read-only retrieval helper for the Mastermind brain gateway.
This module holds the FUNCTION and its Anthropic tool schema only; the gateway
owns dispatch, the tool allowlist, and tier gating. Nothing here writes a file,
opens a socket, or calls an LLM.

SCHEMA: ``brain.analogues.v1`` (see the ``get_historical_analogues`` docstring
for the full key set).

TIER: display / context — DISPLAY-ONLY. This is retrieval, not scoring. It
answers "which dated days does the desk's own measured state most resemble, and
what did the tape do afterwards" and nothing else. It never emits a signal, a
rank, a size, a gate, a forecast, or a probability, and there is no fused regime
verdict or composite label anywhere on the output path — MSP-R2 kills fused
regime scorecards. The one number that is not a raw measured level is the
retrieval ``distance``, which is the sanctioned China precedent
(``scripts/build_china_analogs.py`` ships it): a distance over states the desk
already computes and already displays, with uniform post-z weights, no fitted
parameters, and therefore nothing that needs a promotion gauntlet. The engine
matches; the chat model narrates.

SUBSTRATE HAZARD — regime_history vs regime_vector
--------------------------------------------------
The regime substrate here is ``data/regime/regime_history.parquet`` (the full
daily history back to 1927, rewritten nightly by ``engine/run.py``). It is NOT
``data/regime/regime_vector.parquet``, which holds only the handful of most
recent rows; reaching for the vector when you want history is a #1026-class
hazard flagged in that module's own docstring and would silently collapse the
candidate pool to a few weeks while every other guard here still passed.

METHOD (mirrors scripts/build_china_analogs.py, extended to the US inputs)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Feature vector, 10 dimensions, uniform weight after z-scoring:

  z-scored (7)   growth_score, inflation_score, 2s10s level, 2s10s 63-obs
                 change, 10y3m level, log(VIX), breadth pct_above_200
  mismatch (3)   quad, liquidity, cycle — each mismatched category contributes
                 exactly 1.0 to the Euclidean distance

Distance: Euclidean over the combined vector.

Query = the latest COMPLETE day, i.e. the most recent date carrying every
feature. A partial final row is never matched on. When one of the inputs
publishes a day late — DGS10 and the FRED curve series routinely trail the
regime history by a session — the query degrades to yesterday's state STAMPED
HONESTLY rather than darkening the tool: ``asof`` names the day actually used
and a top-level ``query_lag_note`` appears (and appears ONLY then), which is the
market packet's per-section freshness idiom. The fallback is bounded: if no day
in the trailing ``QUERY_LAG_MAX_ROWS`` rows is complete, the substrate is broken
rather than merely late and the call fails soft.

Candidacy: a day is eligible only when EVERY feature is present on that exact
date — no imputation, no forward fill, so the eligible window is bounded by the
shortest input (VIX, 1990-01-02 onward on the live store). The window actually
searched is reported as ``coverage``; ``n_candidates`` is the number of days
compared after the time exclusion below.

Constraints (China constants, unchanged):
  - time exclusion: candidates must sit >= 120 calendar days before the query,
    so the answer is never "today looks like last month";
  - greedy diversity: skip a candidate within 60 calendar days of one already
    selected, so eight episodes are eight episodes and not one week sampled
    eight times.
  - "unknown" liquidity / cycle is treated as an ordinary category (it can only
    ever mismatch a known query value); an unknown or missing ``quad`` makes the
    row ineligible outright, exactly as the China engine has it.

Z-statistics are population stats over the whole eligible window, which does
mean the z of an episode is computed with knowledge of later days. That is
retrieval-only bookkeeping — it decides which dated rows to show, never a
forward number — and it is the shipped China idiom, so it is mirrored here
rather than re-litigated. The FORWARD paths are strictly point-in-time: each is
anchored to the first observation STRICTLY AFTER the episode date and reads only
observations after it, and an episode whose window runs off the end of history
reports None for that horizon while still appearing in the list.

FAIL-SOFT is the whole contract. This module is imported by the API process
(brain_gateway) and called on a request path, where pandas/pyarrow may be absent
from the venv and a dev checkout may have no ``data/`` at all. pandas is
imported lazily inside the build, the build is wrapped whole, and any failure
returns ``{"schema": ..., "error": "analogues_unavailable", "detail": ...}``.
It never raises.

CACHE: in-process, keyed on the (path, mtime) pair of every source file plus the
limit — a source that appears or vanishes changes the key as surely as an edited
one, because a missing file keys as None rather than being skipped. No TTL is
needed and none is used: the payload is a pure function of the files, reads no
clock, and persists nothing, so there is no clock reading to go stale.

    ``coverage`` is the eligible window (first–last day on which every feature
    is present); ``n_candidates`` is how many of those days were actually
    compared, i.e. after the 120-calendar-day exclusion around the query.
    ``distance`` is retrieval metadata (smaller = closer in feature space), not
    a score, a rank, or any measure of certainty. ``fwd`` numbers are log returns
    (SPX), basis points (US10Y) and index points (VIX); a horizon running past
    the end of the stored series is ``None`` and the episode still appears.

    `limit` is clamped to 1..8. Deterministic, offline, and non-raising: any
    failure returns ``{"schema", "error": "analogues_unavailable", "detail"}``.
