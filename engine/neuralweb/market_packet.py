"""engine.neuralweb.market_packet — Live Market State Packet for the brain's grounding turn.

WHAT THIS IS
------------
A compact, freshness-stamped, cross-asset snapshot of the dashboard's OWN state,
assembled from artifacts that are already on disk and prepended to the user's
turn so the model answers from real numbers rather than memory.  It replaces the
thin nightly prose of ``brain_gateway._grounding_digest`` (whose master_brief /
world_state extraction is ported here verbatim, caps included) with a structured
packet that says WHEN each number was true.

PROVENANCE DISCIPLINE (the load-bearing rule)
---------------------------------------------
This module AGGREGATES.  It ORIGINATES nothing.

* Every number it prints was computed by an existing engine or builder and is
  read back off disk unchanged — the only arithmetic here is presentational
  (normalizing a yield-index print to percent whichever units the feed used —
  see _yield_pct_pair, units are feed-dependent — a change in basis points, a
  mean of index change percents) plus a handful of THRESHOLD comparisons over
  those same numbers.  No new signal, no fused score, no probability, no ranking, no
  forecast.  The deterministic FLAGS are shape observations ("these two things
  moved together, here are the exact numbers") — they are display tier, they
  never gate anything, and each one carries the figures that fired it so the
  reader can check the claim.
* No network.  No writes.  ``datetime`` is used for quote/event staleness and for
  deterministic exchange-session clocks from the canonical calendars. ``build_packet``
  accepts an injected ``now`` so historical tests never depend on the wall clock.
* Honesty is the product.  Every rendered section starts with its own as-of
  stamp, and the header states whether the tape is live, delayed, or last
  session's close.  A block whose source is missing or corrupt is silently
  OMITTED (with an internal note in ``packet["gaps"]``) — never rendered with a
  borrowed or implied stamp, never back-filled from a neighbour.
* The EVENTS wire carries headlines, timestamps and salience ONLY.  House kill
  TI-R5 forbids authored effect chains / beneficiary lists in brain feeds, so no
  effect, beneficiary, or "what it means" field is read or rendered here even
  when the source item happens to carry one.
* No numeric confidence ever reaches the prompt: an engine's QUALITATIVE word
  ("medium") is passed through, a float is dropped, because a decimal next to the
  word "confidence" reads to a model as a calibrated probability and none of
  these reads are that.

SOURCES (each block independent, each fail-soft)
-----------------------------------------------
Live dir (see ``_live_dir`` — env override, then the VPS public live dir, then
the repo's ``site/live``): quotes.json, breadth.json, market_drivers.json,
shock_state.json, risk_state.json, wires.json, basket_pulse.json.
Repo: site/master_brief.json (else data/regime/master_brief.json),
data/neuralweb/world_state.json, data/rates_command/latest.json,
site/vol/regime.json, data/crossasset/latest.json, and a final wires fallback at
data/marketing/press/wires.json.
CN board: site/factordata/china_standouts.json (the published board) +
data/cn_prophet_audit/latest.json (nightly ops telemetry) — both PRODUCT
artifacts, per CXI-R23: chat context reads products, never repo internals.

DESIGN
------
Pure module: stdlib only, no gateway imports, no side effects.  ``build_packet``
and ``digest`` never raise.  ``digest`` caches on the (path, mtime) tuple of every
source plus the budget, with a 60 s ceiling — the same mtime-cache idiom as
``engine.neuralweb.doctrine`` and ``brain_gateway._load_brain_config``.

    SOURCE CHOICE — the intraday basket pulse (basket_pulse.v1, ~14 KB), the
    smallest artifact on disk that actually answers "what is leading". The four
    alternatives were rejected on grain or weight:

    * site-sector-pulse (47 KB) carries the same 46 groups but NO 1-day move — its
      numbers are a composite score, a cross-sectional rank and a 5-day relative,
      none of which is "today".
    * site-flow-leaders (68 KB) and site-leader-radar (326 KB) are TICKER grain,
      not group grain.
    * site-us-standouts is 1.8 MB and its ``leaders`` key is also per-ticker.
    * The nightly baskets snapshot (14 KB) is group grain but, like sector-pulse,
      carries score/rank/label only — no day move.

    The pulse also happens to be the one candidate that is BOTH git-tracked under
    the repo's live dir (so a dev checkout resolves it) and published into the VPS
    public live dir by scripts/vps_live_orchestrator's snapshot lane (so production
    resolves it) — it rides the module's existing ``_live_dir`` ladder with no new
    path convention, and check_vps_live_health holds it to a 15-minute freshness
    bound on weekdays. It is NOT in config/synapse.yml: the whole live plane is
    unregistered there, so declaring it is a governance decision, not this block's.

    WHAT IS AND IS NOT COMPUTED HERE. ``live_ew_chg_pct`` is the builder's own
    equal-weight member day move; this function only SELECTS from it (the same
    idiom as ``_events_block`` sorting the wire by the wire's own salience) and
    THRESHOLD-gates a junk print. The sort key is the printed move rather than the
    artifact's ``tape_rank`` because rank ships null on the eod fallback path,
    and because sorting on the number we print keeps the order and the figures
    from ever disagreeing. A group whose member coverage fell under the builder's
    floor already arrives as an honest null and is skipped, never imputed.

    Zero is neither half: a group has to be strictly above 0 to read as leading
    and strictly below to read as lagging, so an all-green tape renders the up
    half alone rather than promoting three flat groups to "down".

# "…would flip us into Reflation" — and the model copied the English state word into
# its 中文 answer (live zh probe 2026-07-30 carried a bare "Goldilocks" ×3). A model's
# own input beats a language directive, so the token has to be Chinese BEFORE it is
# read. The English text is otherwise left alone: this substitutes NAMES, it does not
# translate prose (the LANGUAGE directive still owns that).
#
# CANONICAL SOURCE ORDER (house sources, in the order that decides a disagreement):
#  1. engine/master_brain.py::_ZH_LEXICON_FIXUPS (~line 2362) normalizes translated
#     中文 *to* 理想增长 and names 金发姑娘/金发姑娘（不冷不热） as the RETIRED variants
#     being replaced — so 理想增长 is the house term for Goldilocks, and
#     engine/alert_triage.py::_QUAD_ZH's "金发经济" LOSES (it is the only house source
#     that says 金发经济, and nothing normalizes toward it).
#  2. engine/i18n.py::LEX — the glossary the deterministic chips render from — agrees
#     with (1) and supplies the rest: Goldilocks 理想增长, Reflation 再通胀,
#     Stagflation 滞胀, Deflation 通缩, Growth-scare/Deflation 增长恐慌／通缩,
#     "Growth scare" 增长恐慌.
#  3. engine/alert_triage.py::_QUAD_ZH is the only house source that names Inflation
#     (通胀) and Disinflation (去通胀); LEX has no key for either, so they come from
#     there. Its Goldilocks entry is overruled per (1).
#
# FROZEN + FINITE — quad state NAMES only. Generic macro nouns (growth, slowdown,
# recovery, contraction) are deliberately absent: they are ordinary English words in
# this prose and replacing them would produce garbage. Matching is WHOLE-TOKEN and
# CASE-SENSITIVE on these exact capitalized forms, so "Reflationary" and a lowercase
