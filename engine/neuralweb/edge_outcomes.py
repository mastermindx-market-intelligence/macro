"""engine.neuralweb.edge_outcomes — Neural Web edge-outcome ledger (quant wave-2b).

PURPOSE
-------
The Neural Web has typed edges (confluence graph ``confirms``/``leads``/
``contradicts``/``headwind``/``tailwind``; causal-scout candidate edges) but no
ledger anywhere grades **"edge fired → did the target actually move, and with
what lag"**.  The spine grades *signal-fires*; nothing grades *edges*.  This
module is that ledger.

It exists for two reasons, and the second one is a house ruling:

1. **Product read** — which claimed linkages actually propagate.  An edge that
   says "altdata confirms radar" is a claim; this ledger is the record of what
   happened after the claim fired.
2. **CHF-R15 evidence base.**  Verbatim from
   ``research/CAUSAL_HYPOTHESIS_FACTORY_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md``:

       **CHF-R15 (evidence clocks).** Registry-seed entries (RF-9: no bespoke
       timers): first-edge-batch review clock (~35d after W3 lands), Phase-2
       dedicated-family come-back (2026-10-15, conditional on >=8 matured
       exit-(a)/(b) candidates), and the Phase-3 structure-learner come-back
       (2027-01-15). Grace 7d.

   The Phase-3 structure-learner come-back has no evidence to come back to
   unless edge behaviour is on the record by then.  This ledger accrues it.

RELATION TO CHF-R14 — READ THIS BEFORE EXTENDING
------------------------------------------------
CHF-R14 says, verbatim:

    **CHF-R14 (kills and deferrals registered now).**
    - Full-graph learners (NOTEARS/DAG-GNN/LoRAM/CMIN-style) in v1: KILLED for
      v1; small-universe NOTEARS-with-priors is a Phase-3 candidate behind the
      §7 clock, admissible only after the scout + null library have operated
      for a quarter.
    - Causal-DAG -> portfolio construction: FORBIDDEN (Codex concurs;
      Article 1/2).
    - Weekly full-DAG re-estimation: REJECTED (churn); drift monitors are
      nightly, structure re-estimation is quarterly at most.
    - LLM numeric confidence anywhere in CHF: FORBIDDEN (RF-16 extension).
    - **New fire/outcome ledger: FORBIDDEN (RUL-ORTH-4).**
    - These rows are appended to ``research/DO_NOT_REBUILD.md`` in this PR.

That last bullet is about the **fire substrate**.  RUL-ORTH-4 is quoted in the
same masterplan as "spine remains the sole fire substrate" (§ architecture
limits: "no recomputation of R-ORTH statistics (RUL-ORTH-9), spine remains the
sole fire substrate (RUL-ORTH-4)"), and its table row reads: "reuse with
env-override resolution + honest data-absent degradation (CHF-R6); **no new
fire ledger** (RUL-ORTH-4)".  The kill forbids standing up a *parallel
substrate that decides what fired and computes its own outcomes*.

This module does not do that, by construction:

  * It **never originates a fire.**  A fire is read off ``spine_index.parquet``
    (the sole fire substrate) or off the existing confluence tape.  No new
    fire detection, no new price pipeline, no recomputation of any outcome.
  * It **never grades an outcome.**  Every outcome number it prints is an
    ``outcome_excess`` / ``fwd_mfe_*`` value the spine already graded.  This
    module is a *join* over two existing substrates plus the edge inventory.
  * Its unit of record is the **edge**, which the spine has never carried, and
    which is the object CHF-R15's Phase-3 clock will be asked to judge.

If a future change makes this module compute an outcome, or decide that
something fired on evidence outside the spine/tape, it has become the thing
RUL-ORTH-4 forbids.  Do not make that change.

AUTHORITY
---------
Display-tier, deterministic, zero fitted weights.  Every emitted row stamps the
authority block: not_a_signal, may_rank=False, may_gate=False, may_size=False,
may_escalate=False, display_only=True.  This ledger EVIDENCES; it never scores.
No LLM anywhere in this path (A7 / Article 1).

WHY ``feeds`` EDGES ARE SKIPPED
-------------------------------
``confluence_graph.json`` is dominated by ``feeds`` edges (1,667 of 1,690 in
the 2026-08-05 store — 98.6%, matching the charter census).  A
``feeds`` edge is *static wiring* read out of ``config/synapse.yml``:
producer -> artifact -> consumer.  It asserts that data flows along a pipe, not
that a market subject moves when another one does.  Grading it would produce a
number with no claim behind it — the pipe is either connected or it is not, and
that is a plumbing test, not an outcome test.  Only the five MEASURED edge
types below carry a directional market claim, so only they are inventoried.

PRE-REGISTERED CONSTRUCTION (fixed before the first run; change = amendment)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Fire definition (PRIMARY) — ``spine_asof``:** edge (src -> dst) fires on
session ``t`` iff the resolved SRC subject has >= 1 spine row with
``as_of == t``.  A fire is an *emission*, so src rows need not be graded.  The
fire's direction is the majority sign of ``direction`` over those rows; an
exact tie yields direction 0 and the fire is recorded but excluded from
agreement (``src_direction_ambiguous``).

**Fire definition (VARIANT, disclosed) — ``tape_transition``:** edge fires on
``t`` iff the confluence tape (``confluence_tape.jsonl``) has a row for the src
subject at ``as_of == t`` whose sequence state is ``new`` (first ever
appearance) or ``strengthening`` (``n_independent_confirming`` strictly above
the subject's previous tape session).  Implemented and selectable via
``fire_def=``, but NOT the default, for a structural reason worth stating
plainly: the tape is keyed by **ticker** (``subject`` values are AVGO, BA, CB,
... — 170 distinct symbols over 544 rows in the 2026-08-05 store), while every
edge in the measured inventory is keyed by ``engine:``/``sector:``/``macro:``.
The two subject spaces are disjoint, so the variant runs clean and grades zero
fires against today's inventory.  That is a coverage fact, not a defect: the
variant becomes live the moment ticker-level edges enter the inventory.
Bridging tape subjects to engine ids would be an amendment to this
pre-registration, not a refactor.

**Outcome grading:** for a fire at ``t``, candidate outcome rows are spine rows
matching the DST subject with ``outcome_graded == True``, a non-null
``outcome_excess``, and ``as_of`` within ``LINK_WINDOW_SESSIONS`` sessions of
``t`` on the spine's own session grid.  Per horizon H in ``OUTCOME_HORIZONS``
the dst outcome is the **median** ``outcome_excess`` of the candidates at that
horizon.  Nothing is recomputed and no price store is opened.

**Agreement semantics per edge type** (``claimed_sign``):

    confirms     -> +src_direction   (dst is claimed to move WITH the src)
    leads        -> +src_direction   (same claim, displaced in time)
    contradicts  -> -src_direction   (dst is claimed to move AGAINST the src)
    headwind     -> -1               (dst is claimed to underperform)
    tailwind     -> +1               (dst is claimed to outperform)

An edge "agrees" at horizon H when ``sign(dst_outcome_H) == claimed_sign``.

**Realized lag (report-only, MIN_N-floored):** the smallest horizon H in
``LAG_HORIZONS`` at which ``|dst_outcome_H| >= LAG_SIGMA_K * sigma_H``, where
``sigma_H`` is the standard deviation of the dst subject's OWN ``outcome_excess``
at horizon H over its graded rows strictly before ``t``.  Below
``MIN_N_LAG`` trailing observations the lag is null with a printed reason.

    DEVIATION, DISCLOSED: the charter phrasing is "first *session* in
    (t, t+21] where |dst cumulative excess| crosses 1 sigma".  A session-
    resolution cumulative-excess path for a dst subject is NOT derivable from
    the graded artifacts — the spine stores forward outcomes per signal row,
    not a daily path per subject — and building one would mean opening a new
    price pipeline, which this module is forbidden to do (see RUL-ORTH-4
    above).  The lag is therefore reported on the horizon grid
    {5, 21, 63} sessions, which is a subset of the intended window, and every
    row carries ``lag_basis="horizon_grid"`` so the coarser resolution is never
    mistaken for session resolution.

THE UNSIGNED-OUTCOME TRAP (fail-closed guard — do not remove)
-------------------------------------------------------------
``engine/neuralweb/query.py`` builds the ``track_record`` ledger's rows with

    # outcome_excess: use fwd_mfe for this horizon as proxy if present
    row["outcome_excess"] = _safe_float(r.get(mfe_col))

i.e. for that ledger ``outcome_excess`` IS ``fwd_mfe_H`` — a **max favorable
excursion**, which is unsigned by construction.  Measured on the 2026-07-07
spine: 276,279 graded ``track_record`` rows, ``outcome_excess == fwd_mfe_H``
for 100.0% of them, minimum 0.0000, fraction negative 0.000.  Any directional
agreement computed against it would read ~100% agreement at every horizon and
mean nothing.  ``direction`` is also structurally pinned to 1 on that ledger.

The same assignment appears at THREE sites in query.py covering FOUR ledgers —
``track_record`` (573), ``board_hk``/``board_ca`` (657), ``board_cn`` (742) —
and the board ones are live in the spine with the identical signature
(``board_hk`` 509 rows, ``board_ca`` 330 rows, both min 0.0000, both zero
negatives).  A dst whose outcomes come from any of them is UNGRADEABLE, reason
``dst_outcome_unsigned_mfe_proxy``.  Two checks:

  1. structural — ``ledger in UNSIGNED_OUTCOME_LEDGERS``, and
  2. empirical — a dst cohort with >= ``UNSIGNED_PROBE_MIN_N`` graded outcomes
     and not one negative value.

Be exact about what check 2 is worth: it is a **backstop, not a second lock**.
It fails OPEN on a single negative value — one signed row anywhere in the
cohort and an otherwise-unsigned ledger grades normally, reporting a near-100%
agreement that means nothing.  Only check 1 is fail-closed, which is why the
structural list is pinned against query.py by a source-scan test
(``QUERY_MFE_ASSIGNMENT_SITES``) rather than trusted to stay current on its
own.  Do not describe the pair as "doubled" or "fail-closed" as a whole: the
empirical probe catches an accident, never an adversary.

FILES
-----
Inventory in   : ``data/neuralweb/confluence_graph.json`` (measured edges only)
                 ``data/neuralweb/causal_edges.jsonl``   (scout candidates)
Substrate in   : ``data/neuralweb/spine_index.parquet``  (fires + outcomes)
                 ``data/neuralweb/confluence_tape.jsonl`` (variant fire def)
Ledger out     : ``data/neuralweb/edge_outcomes.jsonl``       (prospective)
                 ``data/neuralweb/edge_outcomes_retro.jsonl`` (retro replay)

The prospective ledger is nightly-only from day one and the two files never
mix: ``scripts/build_edge_outcomes.py --retro`` writes only the retro file, and
``--nightly`` refuses to run outside the nightly lane.

WIRING — DELIBERATELY ABSENT
----------------------------
This PR does NOT touch ``config/dag.yml``, ``.github/workflows/``, or
``config/synapse.yml``.  Four open lanes collide on those files; the wiring
rides a follow-up PR.  Until then the runner is invoked by hand.

FAIL-OPEN CONTRACT
------------------
Every source is read fail-open.  Absent spine -> zero rows plus a gap note.
Absent graph -> zero edges plus a gap note.  Nothing here raises on a corrupt
or missing artifact.

    ``[t, t+LINK_WINDOW_SESSIONS]``, evaluated at fire dates.  So the base must
    be the pooled median over ``[s, s+LINK_WINDOW_SESSIONS]`` evaluated at
    EVERY grid session ``s`` inside the fires' own span — same estimator, same
    window width, same stretch of calendar.

    An earlier cut of this function got all three wrong: it took a per-session
    median (no link window) over the dst's ENTIRE history (no span match).  On
    the first retro that reported ``altdata -> radar`` at base 0.200 and lift
    +0.078; the matched base is 0.241 and the true lift is +0.037 — about half.
    On a constructed fixture the unmatched window turns a true 0.000 lift into
    -0.667.  A base rate that does not match its numerator is not a control, it
    is a second uncontrolled statistic.

    Returns ``(up_rate, n_sessions, evaluated_ixs)`` where ``n_sessions``
    counts only grid sessions that yielded a median at all, and
    ``evaluated_ixs`` are those sessions — kept so callers can report how much
