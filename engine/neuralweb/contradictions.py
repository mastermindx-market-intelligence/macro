"""engine.neuralweb.contradictions — Generalized contradiction detector (Neural Web W4).

PURPOSE
-------
detect_contradictions(root) scans seven typed signal pairs across the committed bus
artifacts and returns a list of typed contradiction records.

HARD LAW — encoded here per design adjudication:
    Contradiction records are DISPLAY-ONLY annotations.  They NEVER gate, NEVER raise
    a ranking or alert priority, and carry NO cross-engine hard gate.  Promoting any
    record beyond display requires its own pre-registered gauntlet (the China
    falsification precedent).  severity vocabulary is limited to 'note' and 'tension';
    'critical' is reserved for the alert vocabulary (Article 2) and is forbidden here.

FAIL-OPEN CONTRACT
------------------
Every source read is fail-open: a missing, corrupt, or unreadable artifact yields no
records for that pair plus a gap entry.  detect_contradictions() always returns a list
(never raises).

FLIP-AWARE LABEL-LAG RULE (operator feedback 2026-07-04)
---------------------------------------------------------
For pairs where a categorical LABEL proxies a continuous backend scale (pair-a: regime
quad; any analogous label pair), an opposing signal against the label is NOT necessarily
a contradiction when the underlying scale is already near the boundary.

The regime quad is the argmax of (growth_score, inflation_score) but the backend carries
a continuous scale.  When the quad label is near a flip:

  NEAR-BOUNDARY (label-lag, kind='label-lag', severity='note'):
    Triggered when EITHER:
      • transition_state is 'TRANSITIONING' or 'RATCHETED-TRANSITION', OR
      • flip_margin < NEAR_FLIP_MARGIN_THRESHOLD (heuristic: 0.15 z-score units;
        flip_margin is |z| − z_threshold for the most fragile supporting component;
        at z_threshold ≈ 0.45 a margin of 0.15 ≈ 1/3 of the threshold; live example:
        flip_margin=0.05 on 2026-07-04 when the pair fired — well inside boundary).

    Reading: "quad label Q1/Goldilocks lags its own scale: flip_margin=X toward
    <flip_condition target>, transition_state=Y — underlying scores lean with the
    RISK_OFF verdict, label has not flipped yet."

  DEEP-IN-QUAD (directional-opposition, kind='directional-opposition', severity='tension'):
    Only when regime is NOT near the boundary (flip_margin >= threshold AND
    transition_state is 'STABLE' or 'WEAKENING').  This is the genuinely informative case.

Scale fields (growth_score, inflation_score, flip_margin, transition_state, confidence)
are ALWAYS included in pair-a's a.reading so the graph/world_state surfaces the scale
rather than just the label.

SEVEN v1 PAIRS
------------
a. regime quad vs market_state verdict
   Q1/Q2 growth labels vs RISK_OFF/caution verdicts from world_state.json (which
   carries both resolved).  Flip-aware: see above.

b. regime_vector growth trend vs risk_radar scare severity
   Rising growth (growth_score > 0 AND Q1/Q2) while a growth scare is 'caution'
   or 'severe' — co-existing acceleration + scare.

c. oracle complex direction vs sector_central call tier
   oracle_state.json complexes[].direction vs data/sector_central/calls.parquet
   latest row per id.  Complex ↔ sector mapped via rotation_groups membership
   overlap (unambiguous only).

d. vol_regime label vs market_state verdict
   Low-vol regime ('normalizing'/'low') while market_state verdict is 'RISK_OFF'.

e. briefing divergences ingestion
   Reads site/intelligence/briefing.json divergences list (already computed by
   engine/briefing.py) — counts and surfaces top-5 by priority as ticker-level
   demand vs supply oppositions.  NOT recomputed here.

f. cross_asset_confirm verdict as macro edge
   Reads the cross_asset_confirm block from data/regime/latest.json.  A 'diverge'
   verdict is a macro-level bonds+FX vs equity contradiction.

g. oracle complex out-rotation vs entry buy-list member
   oracle_state.json complexes[].direction=='out'|'decelerating' while a ticker on
   the site/factordata/us_standouts.json buy list belongs to that complex.
   Ticker→complex mapping: data/oracle/rotation_groups.json members (basket ids)
   cross-referenced with data/baskets/membership.json active tickers.  Unmappable
   tickers skip silently (fail-open).  severity='tension' max; purely descriptive.
