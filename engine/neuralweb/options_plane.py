"""options_structure — the dealer-positioning block of the Neural Web market plane.

Program of record: charting-app ``docs/MARKET_STRUCTURE_CORE_MASTERPLAN_2026-08-01.md`` §6.

Why the gamma regime belongs in the macro brain
-----------------------------------------------
It is a **conditioning variable for every other macro read**, not another signal beside
them. "Risk-on with dealers long gamma" and "risk-on with dealers short gamma below the
flip" are different states with different realized-vol distributions, and the Neural Web
today cannot tell them apart — so a contradiction check between a bullish verdict and a
vol reading is being run without the one variable that decides whether the vol reading
should be believed.

Laws this block obeys
---------------------
**Context, never a gate** (masterplan §6). ``is_context_only`` is already true for the
whole plane; nothing here may be ranked, scored or filtered on by the Terminal.

**Regime-dynamics law** (memory ``regime-dynamics-law``): a regime label never ships bare.
``index_regime`` always travels with ``regime_trend`` and ``regime_velocity_1d``, and the
trend is computed from the published history rather than asserted. When history is too
short to say, the trend is ``"unknown"`` — never silently ``"stable"``, which would read
as a measurement.

**Honesty tiering** (masterplan §4.1): the regime inherits the dealer-sign convention, so
this is Tier B. ``sign_confidence`` is what a consumer should weight it by, and it is the
same tilt statistic the Positioning tab renders — one definition, two surfaces.

Fail-open
---------
Every missing input yields nulls plus a ``gaps[]`` entry. This block runs inside the
nightly plane build; an options hiccup must never take the macro header down.
