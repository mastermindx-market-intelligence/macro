"""Dark-pool signal layer — the metrics the desk ranks and describes on.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
----------------------
The desk previously derived everything from two numbers: off-exchange participation
(`oe_share`) and the FINRA short-marked ratio. Four defects followed from that, all
measured on the live store on 2026-08-05:

  1. RANKED A CONSTANT. The desk sorted by the raw participation LEVEL. A variance
     decomposition over the 47-date panel put 42.7% of `oe_share` variance in a fixed
     per-name effect (top-20 overlap day-over-day 45%; cross-sectional rank autocorr
     0.58 at lag 1, 0.45 at lag 20). Retail-heavy and thinly-traded names print more
     off-exchange every day, so ranking by level spends the front of the board on
     structure rather than news. `unusualness` here ranks each name against ITS OWN
     norm, which is the part that actually moves.

  2. IN-SAMPLE Z. `oe_z` used the mean and population σ of the entire available
     series INCLUDING the current observation, over an expanding window. A genuinely
     big day inflates its own σ and drags the mean toward itself, suppressing the very
     z-score meant to flag it. `trailing_z` below excludes the current observation and
     uses a fixed lookback with median/MAD, which fat-tailed participation needs.

  3. ONE-DAY MEMORY. A single spike and a ten-session campaign scored identically.
     Desks read the campaign. `streak` counts consecutive sessions above the name's
     own trailing median.

  4. NO PRICE, SO NO CONFLUENCE. The builder read only the `volume` column. Without
     price you cannot tell heavy hidden volume meeting supply from heavy hidden volume
     chasing strength — which is exactly why the old module's direction call had no
     basis to stand on.

HOUSE LAW (binding — read before adding any directional wording here)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
`research/DO_NOT_REBUILD.md` (PSS-AF1 row) and the PSS-AF1 charter:

    "FINRA short volume is not short interest, net selling, or institutional buying.
     Raw short ratio/off-exchange share remains forbidden as a standalone direction
     signal."

So nothing in this module emits a direction. `pattern` names the CONJUNCTION that was
observed (heavy hidden volume + which way price went over the same stretch) and stops
there. That is a description of settled facts, not a call, and it is not standalone —
which is the whole reason price had to come in. Everything here is deterministic
threshold arithmetic on already-observed data: no model, no LLM origination, no score
with authority (display tier only). The word "validated" is never emitted.

MEASUREMENT STATUS (honest null — printed, not hidden)
------------------------------------------------------
The predecessor's accumulation/distribution tag was walk-forward tested on the panel
available at 2026-08-05 (47 dates, n=86 accumulation / 61 distribution events):

    horizon   acc-minus-dist    t      p
    1d            +0.22%       0.33   0.74
    5d            -0.87%      -0.63   0.53
    10d           -0.10%      -0.05   0.96

The sign flips across horizons and nothing approaches significance. That is NOT a
refutation — 47 dates cannot refute anything — it is an absence of any basis for the
directional copy the page was shipping. `data/darkpool/ledger/` now accrues a forward
record so the question becomes answerable instead of assumed.

    WHY THIS IS NECESSARY — the split trap.
    Participation is (FINRA off-exchange shares ÷ consolidated shares). The numerator
    comes from FINRA's daily file exactly as reported on the day. The denominator comes
    from the price vendor, which RETROACTIVELY split-adjusts its volume history. After
    an N:1 split, every pre-split day therefore reads participation ÷ N.

    Measured on the 3-year panel (2026-08-05), 7 of 225 names carried a corrupted
    baseline, and they are precisely the known splitters:

        BKNG 30.9x   ORLY 21.4x   LRCX 11.4x   KLAC 10.5x
        AVGO 10.1x   SMCI  8.8x   MSTR  7.8x

    BKNG read 1.0% participation in 2023 against 31.7% now — which then produced a
    z-score of +53 for a day that was actually BELOW the name's own norm, because the
    bimodal history made the MAD meaningless.

    This is invisible on a short panel (no split falls inside 47 days), so it only
    surfaced once real history landed — and any future split silently re-creates it.

    Detection, not correction: the true split factor is not recoverable from the store
    (both vendor price columns are already split-adjusted; they differ only by
    dividends). Callers truncate the baseline at the break instead, so a name is only
    ever compared against history measured in the same share units.

    The market's own secular drift is ~1.2x over three years, so a 1.8x threshold has
    wide margin against firing on a genuine trend.
