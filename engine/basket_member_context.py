"""Within-basket member context — the leader-vs-chase read the per-name brake omits.

THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. The Top-Picks board's extension brakes are honest and validated,
but both are INTRA-NAME: the absolute one (`pct_vs_200dma >= 30%` → "don't chase", engine/
stock_score) and the own-history one (`ext_z >= 2` parabolic, engine/extension). Neither
knows the COHORT. So when a theme runs hot and the WHOLE basket is ~+30% above its 200d MA,
the theme's *leader* trips the same absolute "chase" brake as a junk name that idiosyncratically
spiked — even though the leader is barely extended RELATIVE TO ITS THEME. Leaders rally more
than laggards by construction, so an absolute brake systematically punishes exactly the names
a thematic book wants.

This module adds the missing axis: for each LIVE member of each basket, where its extension
and its 20-day relative strength sit WITHIN the basket's own cross-section. That lets the page
separate two things the absolute brake conflates:

  * "Leader · in-line stretch"   — extended, but ~with its theme (low ext_rel) and leading it
                                    (high within-basket RS). The leader you want; the trade is
                                    to TIME the entry (wait for a pullback), not to veto it.
  * "Extended beyond theme"      — stretched idiosyncratically FAR past its cohort (high ext
                                    rank / ext_rel) or own-history parabolic. The genuine chase.

HONEST BY CONSTRUCTION (this is why it lives apart from any score):
  * It RE-READS the same validated per-name extension; it does NOT manufacture a new edge.
    Phase-0 (scripts/thematic_rotation_phase0) found basket-AGGREGATE extension has no
    forward-drawdown edge — the parabolic→crash link is a per-name effect. So this is COHORT
    CONTEXT for the per-name flag, never a basket-timing or return claim, never scored.
  * The own-history parabolic flag (ext_z>=2, validated −94% DD) still reads as a chase here
    regardless of cohort — a radioactive name is radioactive whatever its peers do.

Region-aware via engine.group_flow._setup (US + CN/HK/CA once regionalised), same as
engine.theme_extension. All from the daily close matrix the page already loads — no new data.
