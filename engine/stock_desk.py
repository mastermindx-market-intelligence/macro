"""Accountable AI JUDGMENT layer on the US standout top-picks (T9).

The per-stock sibling of engine/ai_desk.py and engine/thematic_desk.py. Where
catalyst_stock.py writes a DESCRIPTIVE brief (summary/drivers/risks), this writes an
ACCOUNTABLE, FALSIFIABLE LEAN per top pick — a direction the model is graded on:

    {ticker, lean: constructive|neutral|cautious|avoid, conviction, horizon_d,
     thesis, evidence[], dissent, falsifier{text, check}, check_by, entry_levels}

and a TRACK RECORD: every lean's check-by date is scored against the realized
forward return of the name vs SPY, so the layer earns (or loses) credibility over
time instead of asserting it.

HONESTY (load-bearing — this is NOT an alpha oracle):
  * The board's cross-sectional rank has NO validated forward edge at this horizon —
    the deep+PIT event gate is NEUTRAL and even SUE at its native quarterly cadence
    is ~0 IC (reports/sue-insider-deep-phase0.md). The validated, shipped content is
    the residual-alpha SELECTION rank + the T1–T7 RISK CONTROLS (extension brake,
    macro/event tax, lottery/idiosyncratic-risk haircut, suggested size, earnings/
    FOMC proximity). The model is told this explicitly.
  * The lean is the model's FALLIBLE judgement expressed as a falsifiable conditional,
    never edge extracted from the detectors, never a position size (the deterministic
    system owns sizing). It must be CALIBRATED to the track record.
  * HARD GUARD — the model may NOT override the deterministic risk reshape: a name the
    engine flags Extended / Avoid / blocked / size-AVOID can never be 'constructive'.
    `_reconcile` clamps it down so the AI can't re-introduce the CASY chase the T1–T7
    reshape removed.

FIREWALL: only public/derived context is sent to the third-party model — the same
fixed whitelist catalyst_stock.assemble_context already enforces, plus the public
Conviction profile + risk block off the standout board. No holdings/positions/
watchlist are ever read. Every public function returns plain data or None and NEVER
raises into the build (degrade-never-raise, like its siblings).

Run:  python -m engine.stock_desk --force      # regenerate notes now
      python -m engine.stock_desk --score       # grade past-due leans only
Writes data/stock_desk/{notes.json,theses.jsonl,track_record.json} +
