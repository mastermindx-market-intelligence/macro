"""Frozen B-15..B-19 disposition matrix + correction/replay/mutation law (V4 B2-0).

This module deliberately has no file writes and no source-system imports.  It is a
RECORDS surface: a frozen, append-only matrix of launch-review finding dispositions
with deterministic classification, correction/supersession lineage, and point-in-time
replay.  It carries NO authority — nothing in engine/ or scripts/ may import it (the
suite's tree-scan test pins that boundary); the deciders it describes never read it.

The evidence law (macro issue #6805, v4 masterplan B2-0):

* Every baked V1 record cites BOTH sides of the audit: the audit-pin citation (the readiness
  review's own line refs, measured against PR #5370 head ``edaf501a``) and the HEAD
  citation (re-verified at ``fdaf4091``).  The audit's line numbers are stale by
  design — the readiness doc says so itself (:212-217) — so neither citation is ever
  "corrected" into the other; they are two pins on one finding.
* PROVEN_CLOSED is never granted from code reading alone: it requires a discriminating
  test that was actually RUN, with its output cited in the record.
* FUTURE_KNOWLEDGE: replay at ``as_of`` sees only records with ``known_at <= as_of``.
  A record learned later can never leak backward, and the absence of a knowable record
  is answered ``UNKNOWN_EVIDENCE_REQUIRED`` — never silently read as closed.
  This is source-known reconstruction, not an immutable receipt of what this audit
  fixture had already recorded; ``recorded_at`` is provenance and does not gate
  visibility.
