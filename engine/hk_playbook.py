"""Hong Kong / Hang Seng playbook — turns the HK regime + live internals into conclusions.

The US engine/playbook.py is irreducibly US, and engine/china_playbook.py is calibrated on
the China A-share tape. This is the HK analog, grounded in the HK calibration
(scripts/calibrate_hk.py, reports/hk-calibration.md, measured on ^HSI, split-half checked):
  - HSI is the regional risk-on/off proxy, so the global RISK overlay is HK's headline edge
    (Risk-on +0.9%/21d, 57% hit > Risk-off > Neutral — and Neutral is the weakest bucket);
  - Goldilocks (Q1) is the BEST quad (+1.3%/21d, 64% 63d hit) and — unlike China — the quad
    ordering is split-half STABLE: Goldilocks is positive in BOTH halves, Stagflation (Q3)
    negative in BOTH halves; Reflation/Growth-scare are middling/context;
  - dual liquidity (PBoC + Fed-via-peg) carries a measured tilt: expanding beats contracting;
  - the HKD peg tells you which way funding is flowing (weak-side defence drains HSI liquidity);
  - no stable single-sector monthly outperformance signal exists (risk-filter only).

Produces a `pb` dict the template renders: quad meaning, lifespan progress vs the classifier's
own history, next-quad base rates, an exposure DIAL with reasons built from live internals
(global risk state, dual liquidity, HKD peg, southbound flow), the framework-preferred sectors
with live tape agreement, and confirmed leaders / avoids.
