"""TOP ANATOMY — extended-move maturation truth engine (RESEARCH / DISPLAY TIER).

WHAT THIS IS. The pure computational core of the TOP ANATOMY program
(`research/TOP_ANATOMY_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md`), implementing the frozen Phase-0
construction in `research/top_anatomy/TOPA_PHASE0_PREREG.md` §4. It answers one
question about an already-extended winner: *has this move changed character?* —
by contrasting extended days that went on to top against extended days that kept
going. Never "collapsed names vs average names".

TIER AND AUTHORITY. Everything here is **research / display tier with ZERO scored
authority**. Nothing in this module ranks, gates, sizes, or escalates anything;
no output is a probability, a score, or a call. This is the **AVOID-not-SHORT**
lobe: its product is entry-side avoidance and trim-conviction *context* for a
position already owned. There are no directional bear positions and no exit rules
anywhere in this program (`DNR:KILL-DIRECTIONAL-SHORTING`; short-side L1 §7
graveyard: "drawdown control is an ENTRY problem"). Promotion of anything here to
authority requires its own gauntlet prereg.

LABELS ARE HINDSIGHT-LEGAL; FEATURES ARE POINT-IN-TIME. Episode discovery, peaks,
race labels and outcomes deliberately use the full forward record — that is what
makes them ground truth. Every FEATURE value at day d uses only bars at or before
d inside d's identity segment. The separation is enforced by
`tests/test_top_anatomy.py::test_features_are_point_in_time` (mutate every bar
after d, recompute, demand bit-identical values).

INSTRUMENT VERDICTS ARE NOT MARKET VERDICTS. A `TOPPED` race label states that a
specific declared race (−20% from the post-entry running peak before +15% from
the entry close, inside 250 sessions) resolved one way. It is not a claim that a
move "is over", and no copy derived from it may say so.

Purity: pandas/numpy only. No repo config, no `lib.config`, no `engine.run`, no
I/O — every entry point takes explicit frames, paths, and parameters, so the
module imports and runs against synthetic bars with no data store present.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IDENTITY SEGMENTS (data-defect rule, recorded in the prereg ratification log
2026-08-10, before outcomes were read)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`data/massive_stock_day` keys by TICKER, and tickers get REUSED. Verified live:
`BBBY.parquet` carries old Bed Bath & Beyond through ~2023, then an ~850-session
hole, then a DIFFERENT company's bars from 2025-08-29. Unhandled, a forward race
walk stitches two companies into one path and fabricates events. So before any
computation every ticker's bar series is split at interior gaps of more than
`IDENTITY_GAP_MAX_SESSIONS` (60) sessions into independent identity segments
named `TICK#0`, `TICK#1`, … (a ticker with a single segment keeps its bare name).
A segment is a **name** for every purpose here: its own history requirement, its
own episodes, labels and features; no window, lag, or forward walk ever crosses a
segment boundary.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTERPRETATIONS (judgment calls made against the frozen prereg text; every one is
conservative, documented here, and reported upward rather than re-pinned)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  "Session" means **the name's own trading bar inside its identity segment**
    everywhere: history requirements, rolling windows, episode gap merges, the
    race horizon, `days_to_peak`, and every lag. The single exception is
    identity-gap detection itself, which is measured on the shared market
    calendar because its job is to see a stretch MISSING from the tape.
2.  Trailing windows are **inclusive of d** (`max(close over trailing 252
    sessions)` is over the 252 bars ending at d, so it is always ≥ close_d).
3.  "≥ 260 prior sessions" is implemented as bar position ≥ 260 inside the
    segment, i.e. 260 bars strictly before d.
4.  Episode gap merge: the merged quantity is the count of NON-EXT sessions
    between two EXT days (`pos_next − pos_prev − 1`). 21 merges, 22 splits.
5.  Race horizon: the forward walk covers offsets 1..250 from d. Offset 0 can
    never fire either barrier by construction.
6.  Race censoring distinguishes `horizon` (250 sessions elapsed, no barrier)
    from `data_end` (segment ran out first, incl. delisting) — both are CENSORED
    per §4.3; the reason is carried so delisting can be audited separately.
7.  Episode peak ties (equal closes) resolve to the **earliest** occurrence.
    "Sessions since a rolling max" ties resolve to the **most recent** occurrence
    (a lag of 0 when today equals the max).
8.  Episode outcome at the data edge: §4.4's "else SURVIVED" is implemented
    literally, with a `peak_window_censored` flag set when [peak, peak+126] is
    truncated, so censored SURVIVED episodes are never silently pooled with
    sealed ones.
9.  RS cross-sections follow the two distinct frozen formulas literally:
    `E1f`/`E2f` subtract the same-day cross-sectional median of individual r63/r21
    values, while `E3f`–`E5f` use `rs_line = c / eqw_index`. The index compounds
    the per-day cross-sectional median DAILY RETURN of that day's PIT-eligible
    names and is rebased to 1.0 at the panel's first session. `rs_line` is rebased
    at each segment's first bar; every downstream RS feature is invariant to that
    constant.
10. `feature_library` returns one row per requested (segment, day) with one
    column per feature — long over observations, wide over the 36 features.
    Coverage nulls are preserved as NaN and never imputed.
11. Matching buckets (quintile of r126, terciles of rv63 and 21d dollar volume)
    are cut **within calendar quarter over the union of cases and the control
    candidate pool** — the natural "within-track, within-quarter" cross-section —
    and the same edges label both arms.
12. "Controls from other names" excludes any candidate whose BASE TICKER matches
    the case's, not merely its identity segment.
13. `matched_delta_stats` p-values are two-sided bootstrap p-values from the
    episode-peak-month block resample (`2·min(P(median ≤ 0), P(median ≥ 0))`,
    floored at 1/(B+1)) and feed BH-FDR within family. §4.5's aggregation is
    EPISODE-FIRST: `episode_deltas` collapses an episode's {21,10,5} snapshots to
    their MEDIAN before anything is pooled, so N is distinct episodes. A Δ exists
    only where the case and ≥2 controls are finite. A direction-declared feature
    must show the declared sign; a direction-0 field can only ever be graded
    `EXPLORATORY-DISCOVERY`, never DETECTION.
14. `top_ruler` computes each metric per BASE TICKER first and then takes the
    median across tickers (per-name-first, then pooled), so one heavily-fired
    name cannot carry a ruler number.
15. D5's `v_z` is volume z-scored against its own trailing 252-session
    distribution (PIT rolling), correlated over 21 sessions with |daily return|.
16. Where a rung carries no `high`/`low`, true range degrades to
    |c_t − c_{t−1}| rather than dropping the name; where it carries no `open`,
    C5 (`gap_freq21`) is null and counted in coverage.
17. §3 RAW-LEVEL ELIGIBILITY. The $3 price floor and the $2M median-21d
    dollar-volume floor read the **raw as-printed** close and close×volume; every
    window, trigger and feature reads the **repaired** frame. This is not a
    nicety: `split_adjust` recovers the factor from the FULL series, so a 2025
    split rescales every 2022 repaired close, and an adjusted-price floor would
    evict 2022 days on 2025 information. The split-factor STEP DAY is ineligible;
    the days before it are never retro-removed. Because the repair divides
    open/high/low/close by the factor and multiplies volume by it, repaired
    close×volume is invariant, so the liquidity floor reads the same either way —
    the price floor is where the leak lived.
18. Every frozen feature is a ratio, a log-difference, an ordinal lag, or a
    standardized quantity over a window in which the split factor is CONSTANT, so
    a future split cannot move a past feature value. That is an argument, not a
    proof, so it is enforced as a hard gate: `tests/test_top_anatomy.py`'s
    full-series-vs-prefix parity test runs a mid-series split through the real
    repair path and demands bit-level agreement at d for a feature from every
    family, and the harness re-checks 3 sampled names per track before any
    experiment runs.
