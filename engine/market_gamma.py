"""Whole-market dealer-gamma vol regime — the SINGLE SHARED deriver behind both the
dashboard banner (scripts/build_site.py) and the machine-readable contract
(data/regime/latest.json, via engine/run.py), so the two can never drift.

Reads the VALIDATED index dealer-gamma store (SPX, data/cboe/gex — the same that
drives the dealer-gamma board, computed by engine.gex_engine). ABOVE the gamma-flip
strike dealers are net long gamma and hedge AGAINST price (pinning / vol suppressed);
BELOW it they are short gamma and hedge WITH price (amplifying moves) — the air-pocket
precondition. A whole-market vol CONTEXT, not a per-stock signal, and an estimate from
delayed CBOE chains, not ground truth.

Degrade-never-raise: returns None when the store is missing / empty / NaN (callers
simply render or serialize nothing). Unlike the episodic `gex_flip_cross` ALERT, this
verdict is STEADY-STATE: it reports the standing regime every build, with no crossing
required, so a downstream consumer reads "dealers short gamma" from a structured field
instead of parsing an alert string."""
