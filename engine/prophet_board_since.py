"""Current continuous published-board membership start (`board_since` / `added_date`).

Display-tier only. Reads existing published board fossils (never a new ledger,
identity system, or authority) and stamps an in-memory `added_date` field onto
candidate row dicts. Truth-under-uncertainty: unknown/unprovable membership age
is always None, never a fallback to signal.asof / board as_of / build date /
wall clock / candidate_episode.opened_at.

LEFT-CENSORING (the defect a prior draft shipped, #6687): if the walk-back
reaches the OLDEST observation in a market's recorded history and the candidate
is present in it, that is NOT proof the streak started there — the history may
simply not reach far enough back. `current_continuous_membership_start` returns
None in that case unless the caller asserts `starts_at_inception=True` for a
market whose recorded history is independently known to start at the board's
actual launch. Every call site in this module passes `starts_at_inception=False`
today; see the per-market adapter docstrings for the evidence.

MEMBERSHIP vs DISPLAY (adjudicated 2026-09-01, REQUEST_REPAIR on the same
carrier): a name's presence in the OBSERVATION series each adapter builds —
what sustains or resets tenure — is a strictly wider set than the pv_card
(chip) surface. MEMBERSHIP = presence in the published board fossil under any
LIVE, name-visible lane/group/definition — every lane whose names are
actually rendered somewhere on the public board page (card, table row, or
link grid), excluding only research/shadow cohorts whose names are never
shown. DISPLAY = the narrower pv_card lane(s) that actually receive the
`added_date` chip. Each adapter section below now names both sets explicitly
(`*_MEMBERSHIP_*` feeds the observation history + today's current-ids fold;
`*_DISPLAY_*` / `*_CURRENT_LANES` still gates which rows get stamped) so a
name moving between two visible lanes (e.g. US buy<->watch, HK/CA
entry_open<->watch) is represented as continued presence in the SAME
observation set and does not reset the streak — only a published observation
that omits the name outright resets it (`current_continuous_membership_start`
docstring above).

    Left-censoring guard: when the walk-back reaches the oldest observation with

    prove a start date, so we refuse to guess one.

    backward compatible and ignores `full_coverage_since` entirely, so every
    existing caller (US, HK/CA before their own floor lands, and the plain
    resolver-core tests) is unaffected. When opted in, `full_coverage_since`
    names the earliest ISO date at which a market's fossil is known to cover
    EVERY name-visible lane/group (see the per-market `*_full_coverage_since`
    helpers below). An observation dated BEFORE that floor may have been
    recorded while one or more name-visible lanes were not yet persisted at
    all — an identity "absent" from such an observation could simply be present
    in an unfossiled lane nothing recorded, which makes that absence
    UNPROVABLE, not proof of a reset. So, under `requires_full_coverage=True`,
    an absence-proof whose anchoring absence observation predates the floor (or
    whose market has no floor established yet at all — `full_coverage_since is
    None` counts as "never sound", not "no restriction") resolves to None
    rather than being trusted. This never affects "present" evidence (a name
    found in even a narrower historical lane set is still genuinely present) or
    the `starts_at_inception` left-censoring path, which is already

# `calls = buys + watch` (its own docstring: "buy + watch, and nothing
# else... leaders / ran / vetoed" are the ones deliberately excluded), fed to
# `engine.board_ledger.append_board`. Measured on the live fossil: `group`
# actually holds `watch` rows today (HK: 321, CA: 248), alongside
# `entry_open` / `setting_up`. So including `watch` in the membership read is
# not merely visible-but-unrecorded (the earlier US-donor / CN-more_actionable

#
#   HK: hk.html.j2's "🏃 Market leaders" table (`_hk_ldrs`, fed by
#   `hk_board_rank.build_leaders_rows` in scripts/build_hk_library.py) is
#   genuinely name-visible (ticker + sector + a real forward-ranked table) AND
#   is a DIFFERENT, disjoint ticker set from buy/watch (`exclude=_claimed`
#   removes every buy/watch/laggard ticker before it is built) — a
#   demote-to-leaders-then-return move is exactly the under-recording M1/M2
#   exists to fix. hk.html.j2 ALSO renders a laggards anchor grid (lines 4459,
#   4489: `{% if setups.laggards %}` ... `{% for r in setups.laggards %}`,
#   name + z-score, same "visible names, own <a> grid" shape as the leaders
#   table) — a second name-visible lane. Both are deliberately NOT persisted
#   to hk_board.parquet: scripts/build_hk_library.py._board_ledger_calls's
#   own docstring records a 2026-08-03 adversarial-review finding that
#   appending leaders/ran/vetoed/laggards rows there corrupted
#   `board_ledger`'s Spearman rank-IC (board_pos is assigned by LIST
#   POSITION, and `board_ledger.scorecard`'s `ic_frame` filters only by
#   `board_definition`, never by `group` — confirmed by reading
#   engine/board_ledger.py directly, no group-based IC exclusion exists) —
#   the same docstring states the safe fix needs "its own book... chartered
#   as a §8-class follow-up", i.e. a NEW store, which this program's own
#   scope forbids ("no new store"). engine/board_ledger.py is also
#   rank/signal-authority code this program does not own or touch.
#   Consequence, stated plainly per the frozen spec: HK's `hk_full_coverage_
#   since` is permanently None until a dedicated follow-up safely persists
#   leaders+laggards coverage, so `stamp_hkca_board_since` runs HK with
#   `requires_full_coverage=True` — every absence-anchored HK candidate ships
#   `added_date=None` (honest "unprovable", not silently wrong) rather than a
#   confidently wrong date. HK's "Recently fired" (`ran`) strip is the same
#   shape but is a non-issue in PRACTICE today: hk.html.j2's own template
#   comment records "no `ran` array (every artifact today)" — it never
#   actually renders a row, so there is nothing live to under-record; the
#   same floor already covers it if it ever ships real rows.
#
#   CA (R1 REPAIR, 2026-09-01 — the original comment here was WRONG and is
#   corrected in place rather than silently rewritten): the original census
#   claimed canada.html.j2 has "NO leaders or ran strip tied to setups at
#   all" and that CA's fossil "already covers every name-visible lane". That
#   missed canada.html.j2's OWN laggards anchor grid: line 2387 ("watch-strip
#   + laggards below are untouched"), line 2517 (`{% if setups.laggards %}`),
#   line 2520 (`{% for r in setups.laggards %}` rendering ticker + name +
#   alpha via a plain `<a>` — the exact "name-visible, own grid, no pv_card"
#   shape as HK's leaders/laggards strips above). And exactly like HK,
#   `laggards` is never persisted: scripts/build_canada.py._canada_board_
#   ledger builds `calls` from `setups.buy` + `setups.watch` ONLY (its own
#   comment at that call site: "the CA WATCH strip was never appended" refers
#   to a PRIOR gap that was since fixed for watch — laggards was never even
#   raised, and remains absent from `calls` today) — confirmed by reading
#   build_canada.py directly, `board.get("laggards", [])` is never passed to
#   `board_ledger.append_board`. So CA has the identical under-recording
#   shape as HK (a name-visible, unfossiled lane that a buy -> laggards ->
#   buy round-trip would silently under-record as a fresh start), and CA now
#   runs with `requires_full_coverage=True` too — every absence-anchored CA
#   candidate ships `added_date=None` until a dedicated follow-up safely
#   persists laggards coverage (same "no new store" scope fence as HK; this
#   program does not touch board_ledger writers).
