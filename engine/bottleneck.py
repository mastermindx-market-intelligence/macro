"""Physical bottleneck nowcast — T1 of the Thematic Foresight Desk
(research/THEMATIC_FORESIGHT_DESK.md).

THE IDEA. The June-2024 13D HBM call was a SUPPLY-constraint call with zero revision
numbers: "HBM chips are sold out for the next two years… manufacturers are investing to
increase capacity," supply ~100% concentrated, the market focused elsewhere. That is the
genuinely LEADING signal — it precedes the estimate revisions by quarters. This engine
generalizes it: per theme/industry, is the supply side physically full?

Eight physical legs, each free:
  leg1 capacity full    : cap-U high (z of CAPUTLG{naics}S)                [FRED]
  leg2 inventory drained: inventories/sales falling (-z of MNFCTRIRSA)     [FRED]
  leg3 backlog building  : unfilled-orders/shipments rising                 [FRED]
  leg4 pricing power     : industry PPI YoY accelerating                   [FRED]
  leg6 language          : EDGAR "sold out / capacity constrained / on
                           allocation" mention ACCEL for the theme's filers [EDGAR FTS]
  leg7 member inventory  : per-member XBRL inventory-days YoY trend        [EDGAR XBRL]
  leg8 member backlog    : per-member XBRL RPO YoY growth                  [EDGAR XBRL]
  (margin trend feeds pricing_power axis in foresight_score.py, not a band leg)

Weights 0.25 (leg6) and provisional XBRL-leg weights are PROVISIONAL — shadow-
calibration pending (§3.2 of the upgrade spec). The live cutoff and z-threshold are
also PROVISIONAL until the PIT backtest (Wave 3a) produces empirically-earned values.
Shadow variants are logged to data/foresight/shadow_bands_log.jsonl from day one
(see _shadow_log_cutoffs; band-level rows — the STAGE-level shadow ledger is
engine/foresight_shadow.py's shadow_log.jsonl; the two schemas never share a file
per the W3b review).

W5a FINGERPRINT INTEGRATION (backtest-redirected Q2):
The NAICS legs (legs 1-4) use 3 shared industry codes for 7 themes — MU/WDC and
AMAT/LRCX get the SAME cap-U read despite being different businesses. Legs 7-8 are
per-theme by construction: they read each theme's OWN members' filed numbers. The 11
previously unmapped themes now get a real numeric path when ≥3 members report.

ANTI-LAUNDERING: legs 7-8 are numeric (XBRL-filed numbers) and participate in the
numeric_composite / numeric_band like legs 1-4 — they are not language and do not
trigger the text-only cap. The anti-laundering discriminator (text cannot tip numeric)
is unaffected: language_z_gated is still excluded from numeric_avail.

The HBM template fires when legs 1-4 fire TOGETHER (demand outrunning supply). leg6
can additionally lift a theme to TIGHT (text)/TIGHTENING (text) for unmapped themes.
DISPLAY-ONLY; returns None/partial cleanly until collectors run.
