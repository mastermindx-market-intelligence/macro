"""engine/prophet_bridge.py — Prophet Origination Bridge (W1, display-only).

Converts us_standouts.json buy-lane entries into prophet.trade_plan/v1 envelopes
and resolves option contracts from the ThetaData EOD store.

PUBLIC API
----------
originate_plans(standouts_path, asof, existing_ids, thetadata_store) -> list[dict]
    Return a list of new prophet.trade_plan/v1 dicts.  IDs already in
    existing_ids are skipped (duplicate-suppression contract).

resolve_option(ticker, direction, entry, horizon_days, signal_date,
               thetadata_store, asof, clock_date=None) -> dict | None
    Return an option_contract dict or None when the store lacks the symbol.

PICK RULE (pre-registered, display-only)
-----------------------------------------
OURS: selection rule documented here; all levels are display-only.

1. Source: site/factordata/us_standouts.json buy[] lane (nightly artifact).
2. Filter:
     a. conviction.band != "low"
     b. gate_go == True  → act_level >= 2  AND conviction.score >= 0  (normal mode)
        gate_go == False → act_level >= 2  OR  conviction.score >= 60 (caution mode)
     c. when the board carries the tier contract, tier must be actionable T1/T2/T3;
        projected T4 remains visible on the board but cannot originate a trade plan.
   Reason: gate_go=False is a macro-caution flag; tighten score threshold, but
   don't eliminate imminent-entry (act_level>=2) setups entirely.
3. Sort: descending by the BOARD's own priority score (row["prophet"]["score"] —
   the canonical ranker of whatever definition the artifact carries; C1 evidence-
   family fusion since `us_prophet_v3`, 2026-08-15);
   ties broken by act_level descending, then ticker ascending.  Rows with no
   numeric priority score (pre-v1 artifacts) sort BELOW every scored row and,
   among themselves, by the legacy key (conviction.score descending).
   W1 2026-08-03, operator-signed: ORDERING ONLY — the filters in step 2 and the
   filters are byte-identical to the pre-W1 rule, so the ADMITTED population for a
   given artifact does not move.  See select_candidates() for the ruling citation.
4. Originate every admitted row that is not a duplicate ID, is not blocked by an
   already-open plan on the same ticker+direction, and passes plan validation.  The
   former 12-plan per-run slice was an attention cap masquerading as an opportunity
   gate; featured-board, sector and portfolio-risk caps live elsewhere and are not
   changed by this bridge.
5. Exclude entries where entry_signal is null.
6. Exclude entries where dir != "up" (only BULL universe currently).

GEOMETRY RULES (OURS — display-only, pre-registered)
------------------------------------------------------
  invalidation = hold.invalidation if present
                 else max-protective of (20d swing low, entry − 2×ATR14)
                    for BULL: max(swing_low, entry − 2×ATR14)  [closest to entry]
                    for BEAR: min(swing_high, entry + 2×ATR14) [closest to entry]
  R = |entry − invalidation|  (risk unit)
  T1 = entry + 1.5 × R  (BULL)  or  entry − 1.5 × R  (BEAR)
  T2 = entry + 3.0 × R  (BULL)  or  entry − 3.0 × R  (BEAR)
  horizon_days = 45 default
  min_hold_days = 10 default

ID STABILITY
------------
  <TICKER>-<DIRECTION>-<formation_date>
  formation_date = hold.anchor if present, else us_standouts as_of.
  The ID never migrates when a later signal event is known.  On new tier-aware plans,
  signal_date is the native T1/T2 event close; T3 has no fired event and keeps it null.
  Pre-contract fixtures/artifacts retain the old formation-date alias explicitly marked
  ``signal_date_basis=legacy_formation_alias``.
  Plans persist across runs until invalidated/expired/T2-hit.
  Re-origination is suppressed when the ID already exists in existing_ids.

THE PRICE AND PUBLICATION CLOCKS ARE DISTINCT (2026-08-08)
-----------------------------------------------------------
  ``price_basis_date`` and ``entry_date`` name the NYSE session whose close supplied
  ``entry`` (normally ``us_standouts.as_of``).  ``asof`` and ``recorded_at`` name the
  run/publication date.  A Saturday recovery run can therefore publish on Saturday
  while honestly retaining Friday as its price and grading clock.  A malformed,
  future, weekend or NYSE-holiday price basis fails closed and is disclosed in the
  intake artifact; the bridge never guesses a prior session.

THE GRADING CLOCK IS ``entry_date``, NOT ``signal_date`` (2026-08-06)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Historical ``signal_date`` values were BASE-FORMATION aliases (``hold.anchor``) and
  could precede origination by months — 94 of 103 live plans carried a gap, PINS by
  152 days.  New plans keep formation separately and use the causal tier event date.
  ``entry`` is the source price-basis session's close, so anchoring the horizon and
  outcome scan to ``signal_date`` graded every plan on bars that PREDATED it: all
  9 EXPIRED ledger rows and both winners closed before their own plan existed, and
  14 plans were born already past horizon.

  The id keeps carrying the formation date (no key migration — the ledger, the state
  files and every downstream consumer are keyed on it).  Every new plan also carries
  explicit ``formation_date`` and ``price_basis_date`` fields.  ``entry_date`` mirrors
  ``price_basis_date`` — the date whose close IS ``entry`` — and the clock, the
  outcome scan, the management τ and the option min-expiry all resolve through
  :func:`plan_clock_date`. Rows graded on the old clock are quarantined
  (``data/prophet/ledger_quarantine.json``), never rewritten: the forward ledger
  is append-only, so a poisoned row is DISCLOSED and excluded from summaries
  rather than edited away.

RE-ORIGINATION BLOCK WHILE ACTIVE (W1 2026-08-03, operator-signed)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  The ID carries formation_date, so a NEW formation on a name that was already
  live used to originate a SECOND plan for it and duplicate exposure in the plan book
  (CLF/PI/BDC each did this within one week; 10 ticker+direction pairs held
  duplicate open plans as of 2026-08-03).  ``originate_plans(active_keys=...)``
  now skips a candidate whose ``<TICKER>-<DIRECTION>`` key already has an OPEN
  plan.  Closure is exactly what the forward ledger says — a closed plan frees
  the slot on the next run.  ``active_keys=None`` (the default) disables the
  block entirely, so every pre-W1 caller keeps its old behaviour.

OPTION RESOLUTION (display-only)
---------------------------------
  expiry   = nearest monthly expiry >= price_basis_date + horizon_days + 15d
  strike   = nearest strike to 0.60-delta CALL (BULL) / PUT (BEAR)
             if greeks available; else first OTM strike from EOD data
  premium  = latest EOD mid-price (bid+ask)/2 at the chosen strike/expiry
  Null + honest note when store lacks the symbol or no greeks row found.

# ── ANTICIPATION §6.2 A1 — status-class admission (ported to the #5071 base) ──
# The admission gate used to be an ACT-LEVEL threshold (``act_level >= 2``, with a
# conviction escape in caution mode).  act_level is derived from the ladder's urgency
# word (engine/entry_signal.py:_ACT_LEVEL), and every PATIENCE status maps to 0 or 1 —
# so the US board was mathematically incapable of originating a plan before
# confirmation, while the CN board (identical indicator engine, identical not_topped
# veto) has featured the patience statuses since 2026-08-04.  Measured receipts:
# research/prophet_us_audit/CN_US_PROPHET_PARITY_ANATOMY_2026-08-07.md (US admitted set
# 27/27 buy_now/partial/buy_soon while the SAME board carried 23 bounce_wait rows) and
# ENTRY_LATENESS_FORENSIC_2026-08-07.md (median +6.34% pre-signal run-up; entry placed
# +2.72% above the signal close).
#
# The new admission is a STATUS CLASS, not a threshold:
#   patience     — the turn is not confirmed yet; this is the pre-move bench.
#   confirmation — the window is open now (the only class the old gate could see).
# ``extended`` stays OUT (it is the anti-chase guard — a stretched leader is exactly
# what this change exists to stop buying) and ``buy_soon`` stays OUT (it graded WORST
# of the CN entry statuses; admitting it imports the chase without the evidence).

#
# THE SPECIFICITY RULE — the whole reason this is not "report the first failing gate".
# :func:`select_candidates` SHORT-CIRCUITS: it ``continue``s at the first refusal, because
# admission only needs ONE gate to say no.  Its order is
# ``no_entry_signal → direction → band_low → tier → status``, and ``intake_stats`` counts
# the refusals that way — as AGGREGATE tallies with no ticker attached, which is why the
# per-name surface cannot be read off ``intake_stats`` and derives its own row-level view
# through the SAME admission helpers instead.
#
# Measured on the committed 2026-08-07 board: **8 of the 25 refused rows fail MORE THAN
# ONE gate**, and **every ``extended``/``topping`` row also carries ``band == 'low'``.
# Because the band is tested BEFORE the status, a first-failing-gate receipt labels every
# anti-chase name "No setup yet" and the ran-too-far story — the exact thing the shelf
# exists to tell — becomes invisible on the surface.
#
# So the receipt evaluates EVERY gate without short-circuiting and then picks the
# headline by :data:`REFUSAL_ORDER`, which is a MOST-ACTIONABLE-FIRST order, NOT gate
# order.  Nothing is hidden by that choice: every other failing code rides the row's
# ``why`` list and is disclosed on the chip's Tier-2 hover.  Do not "repair" this into
# gate order — that is the defect, not the design.

#: code → (EN, ZH).  The ONE place this feature's user-facing wording lives, so the

#:
#: ``conviction_low`` deliberately reuses the BOARD'S OWN public band name for
#: ``band == 'low'`` ("No setup" / "暂无买点") rather than coining a second phrase for the
#: same fact — one word through the whole flow.  ``stood_down`` uses the doctrine's own

# research/PROPHET_OUTAGE_BACKFILL_2026_08.md §0.10.  A plan minted by the operator's
# force-majeure replay carries `origination_mode: "outage_backfill_<date>"`; a live plan
# carries the key not at all.  This block is the ONE place that reader-facing wording
# lives, for the same reason REFUSAL_COPY is: `build_prophet` publishes it onto the row
# and `build_site` renders a count of it on the US board, and the two must never word
# the same fact differently.
#
# VOCABULARY RULING (doctrine §2 Law 2, and §0.10 by name).  The internal name of this
# event never reaches a reader: not "backfill", not "mixed vintage", not "force majeure",
# not the era literal, not the mode slug.  The reader is told the true, useful thing —
# the run that would have made this pick did not finish, so the pick was rebuilt
# afterwards from that day's data — and the machine identifier stays on the row for a
# reader who wants to split the cohort themselves (§0.6c).
#
# NO STANCE CLAUSE, DELIBERATELY (doctrine §2 Law 1).  Law 1 asks every PANEL to answer
# "so what do I do"; this is a provenance chip riding a row whose stance is already the
# card's whole point (buy / near / wait / hold / avoid, plus `what_to_do_now`).  A second
# stance here would either duplicate it or contradict it.  How the pick was originated
# does not change what to do about it today — and saying otherwise would be the false
# claim this disclosure exists to avoid.

RECONSTRUCTED_CHIP = ("Reconstructed after an outage", "系统中断后补记")

#: from and when, and that the record can be read with these separated out.

#: over the subset tonight's board happened to consider.  Rendered once and read, the

    preserved verbatim, with zero authority, in :func:`legacy_admitted` so the shadow
    ledger can keep grading it.  See the ADMISSION CLASS note in the constants block
    for the measured reason it moved.

    A row whose status is not in the vocabulary is REFUSED, not defaulted: the plan
    must be able to state which class admitted it, and a row with no class has no
    honest answer.  Refusals are counted into ``stats`` (``unknown_status`` /
    ``unknown_status_values`` / ``refused_status`` / ``refused_direction``) rather than
    dropped silently — a board that renamed a status word would otherwise empty the
    intake with no alarm.

    priority score, then act_level, then ticker — see the sort block below.  ``n``
    remains for research/backward-compatible direct callers; live plan origination
    always passes ``n=None`` and applies no positional slice.

    ANTICIPATION §6.9 R5.  ONE function, TWO call sites, so the macro dashboard shelf and
    the published ``site/prophet/index.json`` receipts can never drift:

      * ``scripts/build_site.py`` renders the shelf from the SAME
        ``site/factordata/us_standouts.json`` generation the board above it renders from.
        It deliberately does NOT read ``site/prophet/index.json`` for the reason list:
        ``build_site`` runs BEFORE ``build_prophet`` in daily.yml, and ``render.yml``
        never runs ``build_prophet`` at all — so SSR-ing the published receipts would
        print LAST NIGHT'S refusals underneath TONIGHT'S cards and claim a name was
        passed on when tonight's run planned it.  Reading last night's index for the
        OPEN-PLAN keys only is safe, and is all it does: open plans persist across
        nights, while every refusal REASON comes from tonight's board rows.
      * ``scripts/build_prophet.py`` publishes the same structure into the intake block
        additively, for the Terminal rider.

    WHY NOT ``intake_stats``:  #5105's lossless disclosure records refusals as AGGREGATE
    tallies (``refused_status`` / ``refused_band_low`` / ``refused_tier`` …) and
    ``continue``s past the row — no ticker is retained, so "why isn't this name on the
    board?" is unanswerable from it.  This function is the per-name layer over the SAME
    gate, reading status through :func:`entry_status` / :func:`admission_class` so the two
    can never disagree; it adds no second gate and no second vocabulary.

    ``open_keys`` — open-plan identities (``<TICKER>-<DIRECTION>`` keys or bare tickers).
    ``originated_tickers`` — ``None`` means "this call site does not know what was
    originated tonight" (build_site's case: it knows the gate, not the origination run),
    and then a row that cleared every gate and holds no open plan produces NO receipt at
    all rather than an invented one.  When a set IS passed (build_prophet's case), a
    cleared row missing from it is disclosed as ``plan_not_built``.

    ``reconstructed_plans`` — the OPEN plans a call site knows were rebuilt after the
    outage rather than originated live (build_site reads them out of the published index;
    ``None`` / empty from every other caller).  It rides this dict rather than a second
    template argument because the shelf takes exactly one ``cx``, and it is safe to read
    from last night's index for the SAME reason the open-plan keys are: how a plan was
    originated is a fact about its past that no later night can change.

    Returns ``{"considered", "planned", "passed", "groups", "unmapped", "era",
    "era_since_en", "era_since_zh"}``, plus ``"reconstructed"`` ONLY when some were —
    absent, never zero, so a board with none renders byte-identically to before.
    ``passed`` is the number of names passed on;
    ``planned`` is the remainder of the considered set.  Groups follow
    :data:`REFUSAL_ORDER`, empties omitted; names sort by the board's own priority score
    descending, then ticker ascending; ``why`` is the row's FULL failing set with the
    headline first.  Display tier throughout — this reports the gate, it never moves it.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# MEASURED DEFECT (ENTRY_LATENESS_FORENSIC_2026-08-07 §1c): the date whose close a
# plan's `entry` was taken from trailed the day the plan was actually SERVED by a
# median of 5 days (p75 11, max 57), and price moved a median +3.03% over that lag.
# ASTS was served 16.1% above the close its entry was priced at.
#
# WHAT THE #5071 BASE ALREADY DOES (verified 2026-08-09, not assumed):
# `_resolve_origination_clocks` refuses the entire run unless
# `staleness.price_through == last_session_on_or_before(recorded_at)` and the board
# declares `delayed=false`, `unknown=false`, `basis="panel_majority"`.  So the price
# basis cannot trail the run by even one session, and the 57d class is structurally
# impossible rather than merely unlikely.  Re-deriving an entry from "the current
# close" therefore has NOTHING to re-derive from — the entry ALREADY is that close.
#
# WHAT IS LEFT, and what this guard does: measure the lag anyway, DISCLOSE it on every
# plan (`entry_basis`), and REFUSE any candidate whose measured lag exceeds the
# tolerance.  It is a second fence over a stronger first fence, so in production it
# fires never — which is exactly the property the test pins.  If the clock contract is
# ever loosened, this fence still fails closed instead of publishing a stale price.

# Structure-anchored entry zones (ANTICIPATION §6.9 R3)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE DEFECT (§6.9, operator-verified): even the patience picks were up hard over the
# prior two sessions at admission, because the plan's entry has always been the asof
# CLOSE.  A signal that arrives late therefore implies a late PRICE, and the two are
# not the same thing: the structure the name is turning at does not move just because
# our state machine took another two sessions to label it.
#
# THE ANSWER: every plan carries the structure-anchored band it is willing to buy at,
# and the plan's stance names the band.  The disclosed `entry` stays the point-in-time
# price_basis close — a plan never fabricates a fill it did not get — but the reader is
# told to WAIT at the zone instead of paying the print.  The R4 receipt (#5007, 933
# fires / 504 sessions) measured exactly this mechanic: median entry-vs-low 7.26% →
# 2.29%, half-stable ±0.75pp.  The ZONE is what reproduced there; the RESET_TURN signal
# standalone did not, and is not promoted here either.
#
# Three zone classes, in precedence order:
#   wait_reset  — the name is stretched on the daily AND the 3D stochastic (the NVDA
#                 acceptance).  Reset band only, and the plan may never ask the reader
#                 to pay above the last print.
#   reset_band  — a patience-status row.  The board's own MA10/MA20 reset band; this is
#                 the ADAM acceptance shape (a Continuation/Ready leader-pullback's zone
#                 is the RESET band with chase-above at the pullback high, never the
#                 post-pop range).
#   accumulate  — a confirmation-status row: the cycle-low-anchored accumulate band the
#                 entry ladder already computes, with its chase line above spot.

#
# WHY IT EXISTS: 27 of 103 live plans (23 distinct tickers) were priced by NOTHING —
# no ohlcv parquet, no stocks parquet — so they could not be managed, could not be
# closed, and permanently blocked their ticker+direction slot.  19 of the 23 are
# columns in these panels.  The remaining 4 (BIDU, GRAB, SE, WB) are foreign issuers
# in no US index cache; they stay unpriced, and that is a real null, not a lookup bug.
#
# The panels carry CLOSE ONLY.  That is sufficient — the management engine and the
# outcome scan both read `close` and nothing else — and the frame is emitted with a
# single `close` column so a consumer cannot silently read a missing `high` as data.
# Ordering matters more than agreement here: the per-ticker parquets ALWAYS win, so a
# name present in both is never served from a panel and the two can never disagree

    prophet.trade_plan/v1 dicts for IDs not in existing_ids.

    Parameters
    ----------
    standouts_path : path to site/factordata/us_standouts.json
    asof           : ISO-8601 run/publication date.  It is not assumed to be the
                     session whose close supplied the entry price.
    existing_ids   : set of plan IDs already persisted (duplicate suppression)
    thetadata_store: path to ThetaData EOD store root
    active_keys    : W1 re-origination block — ``<TICKER>-<DIRECTION>`` keys
                     (``plan_key()``) that already have an OPEN plan.  A candidate
                     matching one is skipped no matter how fresh its signal_date is;
                     a plan that has CLOSED is absent from this set, so the name
                     becomes originatable again.  ``None`` disables the block.
    intake_stats   : optional out-dict.  When supplied it is populated with
                     ``reorigination_blocked`` (int),
                     ``reorigination_blocked_keys`` (sorted list),
                     the complete admitted/blocked/originated disposition, lossless
                     status, and per-candidate validation failures so the caller can
                     disclose every disposition in its artifact. Never read, only
                     written.

    Returns
    -------
    list of prophet.trade_plan/v1 dicts (validated before return)

    LOSSLESS ORIGINATION (2026-08-08)
    ---------------------------------
    Every admitted candidate that survives duplicate-ID and open-plan suppression is
    attempted.  A candidate can then disappear only through a disclosed validation
    failure.  No featured, sector, notification, funding or portfolio-risk authority is
    widened here; those are separate lanes over this lossless plan population.

    # plans for an annotation, which is never the right trade.
