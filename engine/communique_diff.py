"""Communiqué Diff — discrete, dated, backtestable events from official policy language.

LEAF · SALIENCE-ONLY · DETERMINISTIC · NO NETWORK · NO CLOCK IN LIB LOGIC. This is
the ONE China path to standalone validation (spec D9 / §2.2 / Appendix P4): rather
than a bag-of-words tone (which misses the actual signal — CN-QUAL-6), it detects
verbatim canonical-formula shifts across a running window of official documents.

The signal is in ordering, elevation, and FORMULA presence/absence. Three event
types per new document (against that organ's trailing N-window):

  APPEARED   — a phrase from the phrase book is present in this document but ABSENT
               from the organ's trailing window (first reappearance of 适度宽松).
  DROPPED    — a phrase present in the organ's prior comparable document/window is
               absent now (房住不炒 dropped from the readout).
  LEAD_SHIFT — the People's Daily front-page LEAD ITEM's dominant policy domain
               shifted vs the prior day (layout order = editorial prominence, D9).

Each event is emitted TWICE:
  1. into qbus as a discrete item (theme=policy, entities where mappable), so it
     joins the unified store + fattens the Missing-Tape baseline; AND
  2. as a SALIENCE-ONLY qledger claim (desk=communique_diff, direction=0,
     horizon 21, claim_family=communique_diff) — the forward log starts accruing
     TODAY. direction=0 because polarity is human-review-PROVISIONAL (§5): UNSIGNED
     events are safe immediately; a signed phrase-return map is deferred (D9).

COLD-START (documented rule): with no trailing window for an organ (fresh deploy,
first crawl of an organ), we CANNOT distinguish "appeared" from "always present".
So on cold start we emit NOTHING for APPEARED/DROPPED for that organ and record a
`cold_start` marker; the window has to accrue at least one prior comparable
document before appear/drop fire. LEAD_SHIFT needs two consecutive People's Daily
days. This avoids a first-run flood of false "appeared" events.

Phrase matching handles VARIANT forms: 适度宽松 matches 适度宽松的货币政策 (the
canonical zh OR any listed variant counts as the same formula). Matching is on the
raw document text (title + body), substring — Chinese has no word breaks so
substring is the correct primitive.

Nothing here is ever a scoring input beyond the salience lane; direction is 0.
