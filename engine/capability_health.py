"""engine/capability_health.py — F13 V1: the Capability Health & Freshness projection.

WHAT THIS ANSWERS
------------------
Per CAPABILITY (a product-facing surface: a Prophet board, the market-reference build,
the stock dossiers, the foresight desk, ...) one verdict in
{healthy, degraded, stale, unavailable} — or ``could_not_look`` when Eval OS has no
readable evidence at all. Capability health is coarser than artifact-level output health
(``engine/output_health.py``): several artifacts, nightly lanes and provider-telemetry
rows can all speak for one capability, and a capability's declared owner needs ONE
sentence, not forty per-artifact records.

A JOINING LAYER, NOT ANOTHER MONITOR — SAME LAW AS output_health.py
--------------------------------------------------------------------
This module reads no files, makes no network calls and keeps no state of its own. It
takes already-loaded RECEIPT FACTS (one small dict per declared receipt source, built by
``scripts/build_capability_health.py`` from EXISTING receipts: the output_health view,
``data/run_status.json``, ``engine/provider_health.py``'s JSONL, and freshness-sentinel
surfaces) and folds them into one record per capability declared in
``config/capability_health.yml``. It builds no registry of its own, holds no dead-man
switch and COMMITS NOTHING.

THE JOIN PATTERN, EXTENDED FROM output_health.py
--------------------------------------------------
* "I could not look" NEVER renders as "I looked and it was clean". A missing, corrupt or
  unreadable receipt can never yield ``healthy``; a capability with ZERO readable receipt
  sources is ``could_not_look``.
* EVERY declared receipt source resolves ITS OWN verdict from ITS OWN evidence ONLY
  (:func:`_source_verdict`) — never from a sibling source's clocks (repair 2026-09-04,
  finding C2: an earlier revision max-merged ``last_attempted``/``last_successful``
  independently ACROSS sources before deciding, so source A's attempt clock was compared
  against source B's success clock and the verdict flipped on iteration order). The
  per-capability clocks published on the record are a DISPLAY aggregate only — never an
  adjudication input.
* An attempt with NO PRIOR SUCCESS from that same source can never anchor ``healthy``
  (repair finding C1: "attempted but never proven successful" is could_not_look on that
  source's own axis, not a free pass to the attempt clock). A failure NEWER than the last
  known success (from the SAME source) can never yield healthy either.
* The capability's headline verdict is the WORST of every declared source's own verdict —
  INCLUDING an unreadable/corrupt/unknown-type/blind source's ``could_not_look``
  contribution (repair finding I3: a genuinely unreadable source can never be masked by a
  healthy-reading sibling; ``could_not_look`` outranks every real state in the badness
  order, so its presence anywhere in the fold governs the whole capability).
* An ``output_health_artifact`` receipt source may hand this module an ALREADY-JUDGED
  state (it comes from ``resolve_output_health``, which has already applied the §5/§8
  time-basis and clock-kind laws) — the exact same "fold an upstream verdict, never
  re-derive it" shape output_health itself uses for its ``self_health`` and
  ``dependency`` planes. Other receipt types (``nightly_lane``, ``provider_rung``,
  ``sentinel_probe``) carry only raw clocks, and THIS module derives their verdict from
  ``stale_after_hours``.
* A clock value that is present but UNPARSEABLE, or that resolves to an instant more than
  one hour (16 hours for a BARE calendar-date value — repair round-3, 2026-09-06
  independent review, item 3, window corrected round-5 item 2: a date-grain source can
  legitimately report a calendar date up to a UTC+14 timezone lead ahead of ``now``, plus
  2h of ordinary skew — 14h + 2h = 16h, never the original 26h's undocumented figure) in
  the future, is a CORRUPT receipt
  on that source's axis — never silently treated as absent, and never able to read as
  fresh/healthy (repair findings I2/I4). This applies to ALL FOUR clock kinds
  (last_attempted, last_successful, data_as_of, render_release), not just the two that
  feed the ta/ts adjudication path (repair IMPORTANT-1, 2026-09-05 independent review):
  a corrupt data_as_of/render_release can never enter the published ``clocks`` display
  block either, and forces the SAME could_not_look verdict on that source as a corrupt
  ta/ts would.
* A ``nightly_lane`` receipt NEVER truthfully binds ``data_as_of`` (repair round-3,
  2026-09-06 independent review): ``collectors/base.py``'s ``last_date`` is the group-MAX
  OBSERVATION date across a source's own stored series, not an as-of instant — a lane
  entry with a fresh, healthy attempt/success clock and a legitimately far-future
  ``last_date`` (fred's FEDTARMD FOMC-projection series, real production shape) is a
  HEALTHY lane, not a corrupt one. ``scripts/build_capability_health.py``'s
  ``nightly_lane_facts`` no longer maps ``last_date`` onto ``data_as_of`` at all, and
  ``config/capability_health.yml``'s ``nightly_lane`` declarations no longer claim that
  clock. This engine module's corruption law is unchanged and still applies in FULL to
  any source that genuinely binds ``data_as_of``/``render_release`` (an
  ``output_health_artifact``'s already-judged ``source_asof``) — the fix is entirely in
  what the ADAPTER and REGISTRY claim a lane receipt carries, never a type-based carve-out
  inside this pure resolver.
* Removing ``last_date`` from ``data_as_of`` (above) fixed a false-GREEN-turned-permanent-
  corrupt bug but, on its own, left the nightly-lane DATA-FRESHNESS axis unrepresented: a
  lane's ``status`` is derived from the SAME group-max ``last`` that a forward-dated
  projection series poisons, so a genuinely frozen sibling series inside that same group
  can never push ``status`` off "ok". Repair round-5 restores that axis from a receipt
  that is immune to the poisoning: ``collectors/base.py``'s per-series frozen-tail
  detector writes named rows to ``run_status.json``'s top-level ``stale_series`` array
  explicitly "for the health surface" (one row per (group, series), each comparing that
  ONE series' own last observation against its OWN cadence budget, never the group max).
  ``scripts/build_capability_health.py``'s ``nightly_lane_facts`` joins a ref's matching
  ``stale_series`` rows onto that ref's fact (exact ``group == ref`` match) and forces an
  explicit ``state=stale`` with a ``state_detail`` evidence string naming the frozen
  series — the ABSENCE of a matching row, combined with a healthy ``status``, is what
  actually composes to "healthy": the owning collector's own staleness detector found
  nothing wrong on EITHER axis it knows how to check, not a silent skip of the data axis.
  This composition law depends on the ADAPTER never handing this module a row that is
  itself stale evidence — the writer (``collectors/base.py``) merges by (group, series)
  and never prunes a recovered series, so without a recovery path a single historical
  detection would compose to "stale" forever even after the series recovers. Repair
  round-6 (2026-09-06, MAJOR-1) closes that gap entirely in the adapter:
  ``scripts/build_capability_health.py``'s ``nightly_lane_facts`` discounts a matching
  row once its own ``detected_at`` has aged past a recency window, so "absence of a
  matching row" now includes "the only matching row is itself stale" — this module still
  never re-derives anything, it only ever folds what the adapter hands it.
* Dependency propagation is an UPPER BOUND, never an exact re-derivation and never a
  failover: a capability whose declared ``depends_on`` entry is not healthy is capped at
  ``degraded`` (never silently healed back to ``healthy`` by a fallback receipt, and
  never inherits a worse state than ``degraded`` from the dependency alone — the
  dependency's own record already carries its own, worse verdict).
* A rights/paywall block is a TYPED per-source verdict (``unavailable`` + a
  ``rights_blocked`` reason), never conflated with a failure.
* A deployment-skew receipt (the process's own commit disagreeing with the checkout it
  is running against) CAPS that source's state at ``degraded`` — it can never read
  healthy while a skew is detected, even when every other signal on that source says
  healthy (repair fixture (e) ruling). It never drags an already-worse state down
  further; the cap only ever matters when the source would otherwise have been healthy.
* A transition diff (``prev_state`` -> ``state``) rides INSIDE the single output record
  per capability — there is no separate transitions ledger, append-only store or history
  file. ``prev_seen`` distinguishes "no previous record at all" from "the previous record
  was itself could_not_look" (both would otherwise read as ``prev_state: null``).
* A record whose ``state`` is anything other than ``healthy`` (including ``None`` /
  could_not_look) never renders its summary ``reason`` as ``"ok"`` — an empty
  ``reason_codes`` list still names the state.

PURE. NO I/O, NO CLOCK, NO ENVIRONMENT
--------------------------------------
Every read and every wall-clock reading happens in
``scripts/build_capability_health.py``. ``now`` is INJECTED and must be tz-aware —
:func:`lib.dataos.temporal.utc` refuses a naive datetime. Same inputs -> byte-identical
output; every list is sorted.

NO SCORES, NO RANKS, NO PROMOTION, NO SCHEDULING
--------------------------------------------------
This module carries no score, weight, rank or promotion state, originates no retry or
probe, and performs no failover. It is a read-only OPS/RELIABILITY projection over
existing receipts (F13), not an evaluation or grading surface (qledger's domain).

    Parameters
    ----------
    capabilities
        The parsed ``config/capability_health.yml`` ``capabilities`` list. A duplicate
        ``id`` is deduplicated (last entry wins, matching dict-construction semantics) so
        the OUTPUT never contains two rows for the same id — the builder is expected to
        refuse a registry with a duplicate id outright (repair finding C3); this is
        defense in depth for direct callers.
    receipts
        Per capability id, one receipt FACT per declared ``receipt_sources`` entry, in
        the SAME order. A fact is a small dict: ``readable`` (bool), ``corrupt`` (bool),
        ``rights_blocked`` (bool), ``rights_detail`` (str), ``state`` (an already-judged
        verdict — used verbatim for an ``output_health_artifact`` source),
        ``assessment_status`` (``could_not_look`` when an upstream module looked and
        could not decide), the four clock fields, ``clocks_bound`` (override of the
        declared ``clocks`` list — the loader uses this when a source can only ever
        supply a SUBSET of what the registry declares), ``process_commit`` /
        ``checkout_commit`` (deployment-skew detection), ``replay_of`` (an ISO instant
        naming the value a correction/replay receipt is amending), and ``state_detail``
        (round-5: free text an adapter attaches alongside an explicit ``state`` — e.g.
        nightly_lane_facts' stale_series join names the frozen series/last_obs/age_days —
        surfaced as capped, join-safe evidence, never as a reason code of its own).
    previous
        Per capability id, the PREVIOUS resolved record (or just ``{"state": ...}``) —
        used only to embed the ``transition`` diff. A capability id ABSENT from this
        mapping gets ``prev_seen: False`` (no history at all); a capability id PRESENT
        with ``state: None`` gets ``prev_seen: True, prev_state: None`` (it was
        could_not_look last time) — the two are never conflated.
    now
        Tz-aware; a naive datetime raises :class:`lib.dataos.temporal.TemporalError`.
