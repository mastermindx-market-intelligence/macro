"""Falsifiable SIGNAL TRACK-RECORD for the Intelligence Hub — measure, don't assert.

The hub ranks by an opportunity score and labels names by lifecycle stage. Those are
CLAIMS about the future. This harness records them daily and, once a horizon elapses,
grades them against realized forward relative returns — so the page can show whether the
edge is REAL, and so an unproven signal can be flagged rather than trusted.

Generalizes engine/radar_ic.py from a single edge_score to the hub's leading signals:

  1. snapshot(track_rows, today)  — append today's per-name {opportunity, edge_remaining,
     stage, lean} to data/hub/signal_snapshots.jsonl. Idempotent by (date, ticker).

  2. compute(today)               — for EACH horizon (5/10/21/63d), mature the snapshots
     that are old enough AND price-covered, compute forward SPY-relative returns, then:
       • opportunity / edge_remaining IC  — pooled Spearman + per-date cross-sectional ICs
         summarized with a Newey-West HAC t-stat (engine.validation.ic_summary).
       • by-stage mean forward return + hit-rate — the headline test: do 'emerging' names
         actually outperform, and do 'exhausted' ones underperform?
     The horizon whose opportunity-IC peaks is the signal's measured LEAD-TIME.

  3. a signal is "proven" only when matured n is sufficient AND the HAC-t is significant
     with the expected sign — until then it is "measuring" (may flag, must not be trusted).

Reuses engine.validation primitives + the ai_desk price layer. CONTEXT-ONLY ·
DEGRADE-NEVER-RAISE — no matured data ⇒ a valid 'accruing' payload, never an exception.
