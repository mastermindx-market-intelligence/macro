"""Risk COHERENCE assert — the "can never contradict on a stress day" guarantee.

Masterplan W2, audit #4. Three generations of "how risk-off" (MRS / risk_state /
risk_radar) plus the page banner (market_state) and the bot prior must never silently
DISAGREE about direction. The exact failure #4 warns of: the banner screams Risk-off
(radar) while the conviction gate still sizes Risk-on (MRS). Previously only the headline
STRING was reconciled cosmetically; the gate arithmetic could still diverge.

This module is the BUILD-TIME INVARIANT. It checks, from a fully-assembled latest.json:

  (A) SINGLE GROSS SOURCE — the three gross tables (regime_one / risk_state / risk_radar)
      emit identical magnitudes on the shared bands (they now all derive from
      engine.regime_one.RISK_STATE_GROSS). A drift is a HARD FAIL.

  (B) GATE BASIS PROVENANCE — the sector-central conviction gate declares which risk
      engine drives it. This wave it is MRS (the 2026-06-23 replay did not pass, so no
      flip — scripts/ab_risk_gate.py). The fused gate is published SHADOW. A silent basis
      change is a HARD FAIL (the flip must be a deliberate, replay-gated act).

  (C) DIRECTIONAL DIVERGENCE ON A STRESS DAY — under NO-FLIP (this wave), a banner-risk-off
      / gate-risk-on day is a KNOWN, replay-characterized RESIDUAL (MRS drives the gate; the
      radar-aware banner legitimately measures more). So the bare divergence is a TRACKED
      reconciliation RECORD, not a build-stopper. But (C) keeps its teeth: it HARD-FAILS on the
      three conditions that would mean no-flip is WRONG or the reconciliation is DISHONEST:
        (C1) FUSED-WOULD-HAVE-CAUGHT-IT — the SHADOW fused gate is cautious while the live MRS
             gate is NOT. That is a day where flipping WOULD have de-grossed — it contradicts the
             2026-06-23 replay conclusion and RE-OPENS the flip decision. Hard fail (loudly: the
             no-flip needs re-litigation / the harness is stale).
        (C2) BASIS DISCLOSURE — on a divergence day the page must surface BOTH bases (the MRS gate
             basis AND the radar-aware banner), so the user reads "weather says storm, the position
             sizer (MRS) hasn't de-risked" — informative, not a hidden contradiction. If the page
             collapses to one number / hides a basis, hard fail.
        (C3) ENVELOPE — the divergence must stay within the gap the A/B harness characterized under
             no-flip. A gap wider than anything the replay saw is a regression even under no-flip.

`assert_coherence(latest)` returns a report dict and, when `strict=True`, raises
CoherenceError on any hard-fail so the build stops. Run.py calls it non-strict by default
(logs loudly) and strict under COHERENCE_STRICT=1 / in CI.
