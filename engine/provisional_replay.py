"""Provisional-basis tier replay — the W6 #22 measurement the validation never covered.

THE AUDIT'S CORE POINT (research/ENGINE_PROBLEM_AUDIT.md #22): the freshest, most-acted-on
tier the board shows is computed on an INCOMPLETE resample bucket. ``confluence_tiers._tf_bars``
(:78-80) keeps the last 2B/3B bucket even when only 1-2 of its days have printed, and
``FRESH_TICKS=2`` deliberately surfaces names crossing on that provisional tail. Point-in-time
backtests recompute on COMPLETED bars and never see these provisional fires — so the tier a
trader acts on today is precisely the tier the validation did not cover.

This module closes that gap by REPLAYING each historical day D through the SAME live code path
(``engine.signal_gate.gate`` → ``confluence_tiers.cascade`` on the incomplete tail). Truncating a
name's daily close at D reproduces EXACTLY the provisional-bucket state the live board had on D
(verified: the last 3B bucket that spans D-2/D-1/D on a completed day is 1/3 or 2/3 printed on the
two prior days — the same partial tail the live build resampled). We then measure, honestly:

  (a) REPAINT rate  — a fresh T1/T2/T3 shown at D that UN-CROSSES when the bucket completes
      (drops to no-tier / topped by D+lookahead for a reason OTHER than simply aging past the
      freshness window). This is the "appear / vanish / reappear" churn the audit names.
  (b) PROVISIONAL EDGE — the forward next-bar-filled return (engine.grading conventions) of a
      provisional-tail fire vs a completed-bucket fire. If provisional fires have materially worse
      or sign-flipped edge, the freshest lane is misleading and must be split/badged.
  (c) NOT-TOPPED FLICKER — how often the single-bar not-topped veto flips D→D+1 on one noisy
      oscillator reading (the AMAT-guard's precision/recall cost the audit flags).

Determinism: a given (ticker, D, series-truncated-at-D) always yields the SAME tier — the cascade
is a pure function of the close history (tests/test_provisional_replay.py pins this). RESEARCH /
measurement telemetry only — never a trade trigger, never mutates the live board.

Design mirrors engine/china_standout_track + engine/grading: pure pandas/numpy, degrade-safe,
next-bar fills, honest CIs. Callers pass their own {ticker: close Series} panel in.
