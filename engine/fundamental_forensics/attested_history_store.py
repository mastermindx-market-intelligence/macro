"""Read-only store for the DEDICATED attested-history bucket.

The sealed Fundamental Forensics receipts do not live in the Research Vault
bucket.  They live in their own bucket addressed only by
``FF_ATTESTED_R2_READONLY_{ENDPOINT,ACCESS_KEY_ID,SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,BUCKET}``.
This module is the only way the production HTTP API reaches them.  It never
reads ``R2_RESEARCH_*``, generic ``R2_*``, or ``RESEARCH_LOCAL_STORE``, and it
never imports ``engine.research_vault.r2_store.build_store``: a bucket
mismatch there would silently serve — or silently fail to serve — from the
wrong object namespace, which is worse than a bounded 503.

The credential handed to boto is always a locally signed, short-lived child
scoped to ``object-read-only`` with exactly ``GetObject``/``HeadObject`` on the
single ``fundamental_forensics/`` prefix.  A 30-minute child cannot simply be
cached forever in a long-running server, so this store re-mints under a lock
before the child expires and rebuilds its client with the new session token.

DESIGN NOTE — why the parent secrets are NOT popped from ``os.environ``.
The operator CLI (``scripts/run_fundamental_forensics_attested_history.py``)
deliberately pops ``FF_ATTESTED_R2_READONLY_ACCESS_KEY_ID`` and
``..._SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`` after minting, because it is a one-shot process
inside a scoped CI step that will never need to mint again.  This API is the
opposite case and must not copy that behaviour.  ``/etc/macro-api.env`` is
re-read by systemd on every restart, so popping buys nothing durable; what it
would buy is a store that can never renew its own child and a surprising,
order-dependent environment for anything else in a forking server.  The parent
material therefore stays in private instance attributes, is never logged, and
never leaves this module — ``__repr__`` is overridden so a traceback or log
line cannot print it.
