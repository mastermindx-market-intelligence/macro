"""Compose the tenant-neutral ``ontology_explorer_snapshot.v1`` (F04-X1).

WHAT THIS IS
------------
A pure, request-time READER. It answers one question for one transmission
chain — what does the owner-observed path actually say right now — and it
answers it by composing artifacts that other owners already produced:

    knowledge/transmission/<chain>.yaml     the path definition (canonical)
    data/transmission/chain_state.json      the compiled owner observation
    data/transmission/chain_episodes.jsonl  recorded transitions, when present

It creates no graph, no causal model, no truth store, no cache and no second
evaluation of anything. ``/transmission.html`` remains the canonical rates/TXI
owner surface; this module composes read-only on top of it.

WHY IT DOES NOT CALL THE CANONICAL EVALUATOR
--------------------------------------------
``engine.transmission_chains.run()`` defaults to ``write=True`` and APPENDS
``chain_episodes.jsonl``. A request-time consumer that reached for it would
mutate an owner artifact on a GET, and would re-derive state the nightly has
already derived. So this module reads the compiled artifact and never evaluates.

It also does not call ``validate_chain()``. That validator is the NIGHTLY's
gate: it raises on the first structural violation, and it already guarantees in
production that hops form a simple path in declared-node order. A request-time
composer needs the opposite disposition — it must DEGRADE with a typed, legible
state rather than raise a compiler error at a researcher, and it must not
silently change product semantics the next time the nightly's strictness moves.
So the structural questions this surface actually depends on — path order, cycle
freedom, node coverage, revision coherence, size bounds — are asked here,
directly, against the bytes that were read.

WHAT IT REFUSES TO SAY
----------------------
Three refusals are load-bearing, and each exists because the plausible-looking
alternative is false:

  * A confirmed DOWNSTREAM leg never activates a false upstream one. The frozen
    reference case has a true terminal leg over three false upstream legs; that
    is a contradiction to report, not partial activation and not an attribution.
  * An absent baseline is NOT "nothing changed". Zero recorded transitions means
    the comparison cannot be made, so the answer is ``comparison_unavailable``.
  * Freshness is never claimed. This process reads the checkout it runs in and
    cannot observe what the deployed canonical surface serves, so it reports the
    source age it can actually measure and marks the comparison unavailable.

Frequencies and episode counts are historical context, never confidence, and
this surface carries no rank, gate, size or trade authority.
