EXTRACTION HISTORY
  Canonical source functions extracted from:
    - engine.china_sector_pathway._wilson       → wilson_ci()

    - engine.china_sector_cycles_grader._rate_verdict → rate_verdict()
    - scripts.keystone_position_gate_phase0._wilson / _month_block_boot_ci
      → NOTE: that script has LOCAL copies; a future wave should converge them
        to import from here (see comment at bottom of this file: FUTURE CONVERGENCE).

Every grader imports from this module — there is ONE implementation of each
statistic, not multiple copies. D2 §2.1 (CYCLE_INTELLIGENCE_MASTERPLAN §3).

RULING A2 (BINDING): the n/h Wilson shortcut MUST NOT be used as a proxy for
effective-n when cells are cross-sectionally correlated (e.g. ~30 co-moving ETFs
stamped on the same date). Use block_bootstrap_ci() — which resamples whole stamp
DATES so correlated same-day rows move together — as the primary inference tool.
effective_n() is provided as an OVERLAP DEFLATOR for daily-cadence graders (see
docstring) but is explicitly NOT a substitute for block bootstrap in multi-instrument
panels (A2, arbitrated 2026-07-02).

def wilson_ci(k: int, n: int, z: float = 1.96) -> tuple[float, float] | None:
    """Wilson score interval for a proportion k/n.

    Canonical copy of engine.china_sector_pathway._wilson. Returns the (lo, hi) 95%
    interval as floats rounded to 3 decimal places, or None when n == 0.

    Statistical contract: the Wilson interval has nominal coverage 1-α for binomial
    proportions; it is the standard choice for small n (better than Normal approximation
    which can produce negative bounds). z defaults to 1.96 for 95% CI.

    Usage example::

        lo, hi = wilson_ci(30, 50)   # 60% hit rate, n=50
        # → (0.458, 0.730)

    RULING A2 NOTE: do NOT use wilson_ci(k, n_eff) as a substitute for
    block_bootstrap_ci when rows share cross-sectional correlation. The n/h deflator

    width by √(effective_ρ / n) or more.

    Canonical copy and extension of engine.china_sector_cycles_grader._boot_gap_ci,

    Parameters
    ----------
    dates : array of date labels (string or Timestamp) identifying the stamp date for

    calendar: pd.DatetimeIndex,
) -> float:
    """Effective independent sample size for OVERLAPPING forward windows.

    When forward windows of length H bars overlap, sequential stamps share information;
    naive n over-counts. This function estimates the Newey-West-style effective n:

        n_eff ≈ m / (1 + 2 · avg_overlap · avg_neighbors)

    where avg_overlap is the mean fractional overlap between stamp pairs whose windows
    intersect, and avg_neighbors is the mean count of other stamps within H bars.

    IMPORTANT — RULING A2: this deflator corrects for SERIAL overlap (a single
    instrument stamped at daily cadence). It does NOT correct for CROSS-SECTIONAL
    correlation (30 co-moving ETFs stamped on the same date). For multi-instrument
    panels, use block_bootstrap_ci() which resamples whole dates. Using n_eff as an
    input to wilson_ci on a cross-sectional panel would STILL understate CI width.

    Parameters
    ----------
    stamp_dates    : array of stamp dates (Timestamp or str) sorted ascending.
    horizon_bars   : forward window length in trading bars (e.g. 21 for 1-month).
    calendar       : pd.DatetimeIndex of all trading days (the reference calendar).

    Returns
    -------
    float in [1.0, len(stamp_dates)], clamped.

    Rules of thumb:
      - Monthly stamps, H=21: avg_neighbors ≈ 0 → n_eff ≈ m  (no overlap).
      - Daily stamps, H=21:   avg_neighbors ≈ 20 → n_eff ≈ m/21.
      - Daily stamps, H=63:   avg_neighbors ≈ 62 → n_eff ≈ m/63.

    This is the load-bearing reason D2 chose monthly backfill cadence: it makes
    n_eff ≈ n by construction, so overlap-inflation is negligible at the source.

    Usage example::

        cal = pd.bdate_range("2020-01-01", "2024-12-31")
        # monthly stamps — minimal overlap
        monthly = pd.bdate_range("2020-01-31", "2024-12-31", freq="BME")
        n_eff_m = effective_n(monthly.values, 21, cal)
        # → approximately len(monthly) (near-zero overlap)

        # daily stamps — heavy overlap at H=21
        daily = cal
        n_eff_d = effective_n(daily.values, 21, cal)

    Bins forecast probabilities into equal-width buckets and computes the mean

    Parameters
    ----------
    probs    : 1-D array of predicted probabilities in [0, 1].
    outcomes : 1-D binary array of realized outcomes (0 or 1), aligned to probs.

    daily stamps with a 63d forward window) share information across adjacent bins

    Parameters
    ----------
    dates      : 1-D array of date labels (str or Timestamp), aligned to values.
                 Will be sorted chronologically before splitting.
    values     : 1-D numeric array aligned to dates. Treated as proportions (rates)
                 for Wilson CI computation: values should be in {0, 1} for a rate
                 series, or arbitrary floats for a continuous series (Wilson CI is
                 skipped for non-binary values; only mean and std are returned).
    split_date : optional explicit split date. If provided and n_splits == 2, this
                 date is used as the era boundary instead of the median date. Has no

    dict with keys:
        - 'n_splits'    : int — number of eras.

              - 'era'       : int — era index (0-based).
              - 'date_lo'   : str — earliest date in the era.

              - 'ci_lo'     : float | None — Wilson CI lower (binary series only).
              - 'ci_hi'     : float | None — Wilson CI upper (binary series only).
              - 'is_binary' : bool — whether values in this era are all 0/1.
        - 'verdict'     : str — one of:
              'consistent'       — all era means have the same sign and no era CI
                                   is insufficient-n; eras within 2σ of each other.
              'sign_flip'        — at least one era pair has means of opposite sign.
              'insufficient_n'   — at least one era has n < min_n.
              'inconclusive'     — n sufficient but spread exceeds 2σ boundary.

    Statistical contract: this is a descriptive split; it is NOT a statistical test
    for structural breaks. A "consistent" verdict does not imply stationarity —
    it means the means do not flip sign and are reasonably close given sampling error.
    Use block_bootstrap_ci() or block_bootstrap_scalar_ci() for inference on the
    GAP between eras. No p-hacking knobs are exposed beyond the declared parameters.

    OVERLAP WARNING: on overlapping long-horizon rows each era will have fewer
    independent observations than n suggests. The Wilson CIs within each era will
    understate uncertainty. Point to block_bootstrap primitives for confirmed-edge
    work; this function is for exploratory display-tier stability checks.

    IN-SAMPLE FITTING WARNING: when prior_alpha and prior_beta are None (the default),
    the prior is estimated by method-of-moments on THE SAME CELLS being shrunk. This

    prior_alpha and prior_beta that were fixed before outcome contact.

    Statistical contract: the posterior mean for cell i is:
        shrunk_i = (k_i + α) / (n_i + α + β)

#
# scripts/keystone_position_gate_phase0.py contains LOCAL copies of:
#   - _wilson()                  → converge to: from engine.grading_stats import wilson_ci
#   - _month_block_boot_ci()     → converge to: from engine.grading_stats import block_bootstrap_ci
#   - _abs_ci()                  → (no equivalent yet; could become block_bootstrap_scalar_ci)
#
# These were isolated in a standalone research script (W0.4) intentionally to avoid
# coupling to the not-yet-existing library. A future wave (D2-W4 or later) should
# converge them so there is exactly ONE implementation in the entire codebase.
# The research script is in scripts/keystone_position_gate_phase0.py.
