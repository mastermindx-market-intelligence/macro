"""Recovery-quality qualifiers for international market turn states.

The price-state engine answers a narrow question: has the broad index begun to
repair after a damaged/downward regime?  It does not, by itself, answer whether
that repair has healthy leadership or a supportive external backdrop.

This module keeps those authorities separate:

* price state remains the primary structural classifier;
* peer breadth and a market-specific leading-risk radar qualify recovery;
* geopolitical and election-cycle items are display-only context and never
  change the phase, score, probability, rank, or position size.
