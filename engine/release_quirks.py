"""MRI PR-I — Release quirk flags (MRI-R20) + W11-E Track S additions (MRI-R38).

Deterministic calendar-fact flags for upcoming macro releases.  Each flag is a
pure annotation {code, en, zh, cite}; flags NEVER alter point, intervals, or
skew — enforced by construction (this module emits metadata only).

Flags implemented:
  cpi_weight_update        — CPI January print (published mid-Feb): annual
                             BLS expenditure-weight update + seasonal-factor revision.
  cpi_health_insurance_reset — CPI months when BLS's semiannual health-insurance
                             retained-earnings update lands (Apr and Oct prints
                             since Oct 2023).
  nfp_benchmark_revision   — NFP January print (published early Feb): CES annual
                             benchmark revision + CPS population controls.
  nfp_five_week_gap        — months where the gap between consecutive NFP survey
                             reference weeks (week containing the 12th) is 5 weeks
                             instead of 4 (pure calendar computation).
  claims_holiday_week      — claims week whose period end-date falls within 3
                             calendar days of New Year's Day, July 4, Thanksgiving
                             (4th Thursday of November), or Christmas.

W11-E Track S additions (MRI-R38):
  active_strike             — BLS work-stoppages: active stoppage ≥25k workers
                              overlapping the NFP reference week. Reads from
                              data/bls_work_stoppages/stoppages.parquet (fail-open:
                              falls back to collectors/bls_work_stoppages.SEED_ROWS).
  nfp_preliminary_benchmark — BLS preliminary benchmark magnitude >|100k| (released
                              in Aug/Sep/Oct depending on year; matching is year-based,
                              not month-based) → flag the following January print.  Reads
                              data/release_forecast/quirk_calendars/nfp_preliminary_benchmarks.yml;
                              seeded with known episodes through 2024.
  government_shutdown       — Appropriations gap / government shutdown overlapping
                              the NFP reference week or CPI survey window.  Reads
                              data/release_forecast/quirk_calendars/government_shutdowns.yml.
  census_hiring             — Decennial census temporary worker peak / drawdown months.
                              Currently inactive (next decennial: 2030).  Implemented
                              as a pure-calendar check on known decennial years.
  hurricane_landfall        — Hurricane landfall within 30 calendar days before the
                              NFP reference week.  Reads
                              data/release_forecast/quirk_calendars/hurricane_landfalls.yml.
                              Live NHC collector is comeback scope.
