"""basket_turn_watch — EOD K-of-N confluence organ per US basket (FTR W4).

Clones the engine/hk_washout_watch.py pattern (six organs, ledger, display-only,
exit-0). Detects whether enough independent legs agree that a basket is showing
turn-watch / ignition conditions.

DOCTRINE
--------
- DISPLAY-ONLY / CONTEXT.  Authority block: tier=display, horizon_role=context,
  may_rank/gate/size/escalate = false.
- DISCLOSURE: sector-level standalone washout→turn triggers printed NULL
  (Oracle P8 P-W1/S-W3; DO_NOT_REBUILD §2 "Washout × turn"). This organ is a
  *different construction* (multi-leg confluence, basket granularity) shipped
  display-tier as an expected-NULL forward meter (FT-R9). Not a revival claim.
- FT-R3: shock_relative_bid is a binary present/absent confluence flag —
  no ranking, no beneficiary / casualty / shelter / front_run / buy / direction
  fields anywhere.
- Forward ledger starts at ship date; no backfilled gradeable claims (FT-R9).
  Backscan = site-artifact descriptive only.
- Nightly writer: the COLLECT_LANE gate in stamp_ledger() ensures only the nightly
  engine lane writes to data/ (house law: nightly is the sole advancer of data/ ledgers).
  COLLECT_LANE=nightly is set on daily.yml's engine-job parallel step env; US_LANE is
  accepted as a legacy alias for tests.
- Idempotent re-runs: keep-first per (date, basket_id).
- 2-session hysteresis on state downgrade (TI-R3 shape).
- COVERAGE IS DISCLOSED, NOT ASSUMED (W-B).  Every basket row carries
  `members_read` / `members_total`, and a basket read below
  COVERAGE_WARN_FRACTION of its active membership raises a GitHub annotation.
  A basket scored on a fraction of its members must never print
  indistinguishably from a fully-read one.

SIX LEGS v1 (FROZEN per FT-R9)
--------------------------------
1. impulse_day      ≥1/3 of active members with day return ≥ +3%  (floor: 2 members)
2. rs_z             basket EW 1d return vs SPY, z-scored cross-sectionally ≥ +2
3. breadth_surge    z of today's Δpct50 (Δfraction above 50d MA) vs trailing 60-session
                    Δpct50 distribution ≥ 2, AND ≥2 members crossed today
4. volume_confirm   basket EW dollar-volume ≥ 1.5× its 20d median
5. complex_confirm  ≥2 sibling baskets in the same theme-complex with positive 1d rs z
6. shock_relative_bid BINARY flag — market_drivers primary ∈ {oil_shock, geopolitical}
                    AND SPY down AND this basket's 1d rs z > 0

STATES
------
WATCH    K ≥ 2
IGNITION K ≥ 3 AND rs_z leg is true
+ 2-session hysteresis before state downgrade

# SPY is the rs_z BENCHMARK and is a member of no basket (verified against

# data/stocks/SPY.parquet — SPY only ever lands in data/yahoo/.  Looking it up
# under "stocks" alone therefore missed unconditionally, which left spy_ret None
# and made the three legs that require it (rs_z, complex_confirm,
# shock_relative_bid) unable to fire — and IGNITION, which is gated on
# `k >= STATE_IGNITION_K AND rs_z`, arithmetically unreachable.  The benchmark
# ladder below is #4579 verbatim and MUST stay benchmark-scoped: data/yahoo/ is
# an index/ETF store, not a member store, and a member that fell through to it
# would be reading a different collector's tape.
_STORE_LADDER: dict[str, tuple[str, ...]] = {"SPY": ("stocks", "yahoo")}

# MEMBER ladder (W-B, #4579's sibling defect D12).  data/stocks/ is the deep
# adjusted store but it only holds ~235 names, while the 47 baskets' membership
# union is ~683 — so a member absent from it was SILENTLY skipped from
# closes_map and the basket was scored on whatever fraction happened to be
# there.  Measured on the real store 2026-08-05, during the exact week both
# baskets ignited: gold_miners read 1/12 members (NEM alone), space_economy
# 0/15.  Full member history for the remainder lives in data/baskets/ohlcv/
# (~2,768 names; ASTS 1,694 bars, AEM 3,163 bars) — the same store
# scripts/audit_universe.py already walks as
# `MembershipResolver(data_dir, ["stocks", "baskets/ohlcv"])`.
#
# ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING.  data/stocks/ keeps first refusal for the ~235 names it
# has: it is the deeper adjusted series (NEM 11,688 bars from 1980 vs 3,163 from
# 2014) that the rolling legs — breadth_surge's 50d MA over a 60-session
# distribution, volume_confirm's 20d median — were shaped against.

# nothing.  (The two stores agree where they overlap: NEM's last two closes are
# byte-identical across them.)
