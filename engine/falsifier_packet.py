"""engine/falsifier_packet.py — A1 Falsifier Packet (LHB-W3).

Program: Long-Hold Thesis lobe.
Adjudication:
  research/LONG_HOLD_LOBE_BRAINSTORM_ADJUDICATION_BY_FABLE.md  (LHB-R2, R3)
  research/FALSIFIER_FIELD_BOOK_ADJUDICATION_BY_FABLE.md       (FFB-R2, R3, R5, R7, R9)

DISPLAY-ONLY. _display_only=True, horizon_role="hold_thesis".
This module MUST NOT feed board ordering, alert triage, top-setups gates,
or push floor (LHB-R2 / LH-R1 firewall). Raw enums are legal on the admin
Long-Hold page (Tier-3) and ONLY there.

ZERO hypothesis slots, ZERO fused scores, ZERO composite outputs.

=============================================================================
STATUS VOCABULARY (LHB-R3 — deterministic-escalation law)
=============================================================================

Exactly five values, no others:

  not_observed         — the observable exists and no deterioration has been
                         seen in the available evidence.
  no_break_observed    — one prior confirmed period with no break (slightly
                         stronger than not_observed: positive absence).
  challenged           — two consecutive filed periods show the same named
                         deterioration, OR a single filed event opens review.
                         State is sticky but reversible. NEVER auto-escalated
                         to broken by any sensor other than Item 1.03 or a
                         registered terminal event.
  broken               — AUTO-BROKEN ONLY from filed terminal events:
                           * 8-K Item 1.03 — bankruptcy/receivership; OR
                           * a filed primary-endpoint failure named in a
                             registered contract; OR
                           * a filed agreement termination explicitly named
                             in a registered contract.
                         No other trigger may produce broken. (LHB-R3)
  unverifiable         — evidence is stale (>400d since last computable
                         filing), missing entirely, or scope-contaminated.
                         Stale evidence → unverifiable, NEVER no_break_observed.

=============================================================================
STATUS MAPPING TABLE (deterministic, module-level)
=============================================================================

Source state                         → packet axis status
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Moat-falsifier sensor fired=True     → challenged
Moat-falsifier sensor fired=False    → no_break_observed
Moat-falsifier sensor coverage=missing → unverifiable

Thesis-funnel state:
  thesis_candidate_shadow            → not_observed  (no survival flags fire)
  watch_for_thesis                   → not_observed  (survival ok; piotroski gap)
  not_eligible (s2_moat_falsifier)   → challenged    (moat fire is the reason)
  not_eligible (s1_dilution)         → challenged    (dilution = capital break)
  not_eligible (s3_solvency)         → challenged    (solvency trigger)
  not_eligible (s4_coverage)         → unverifiable  (insufficient data)
  not_eligible (other)               → challenged    (conservative default)
  absent/unknown                     → unverifiable

Capital allocation delta:
  accretive                          → no_break_observed
  neutral                            → not_observed
  dilutive                           → challenged
  unavailable or None                → unverifiable

8-K item routing (A6 hard-stop bus) — archetype-blind in v1 (no per-ticker
registered archetypes yet — every event opens review; per LHB-W3 spec):
  Item 1.03 (bankruptcy/receivership)         → broken  (the ONLY auto-broken)
  Item 1.02 (material-agreement termination)  → challenged  (Named-contract review)
  Item 2.04 (acceleration/default)            → challenged  (Solvency review)
  Item 3.01 (listing failure)                 → challenged  (Financing review)
  Item 3.02 (actual issuance)                 → challenged  (Financing review)
  Item 4.02 (non-reliance/material weakness)  → challenged  (Evidence challenged)
  Item 5.02 (key departure)                   → challenged  (Succession review)

Evidence staleness:
  >400d since last computable filing           → unverifiable (never no_break_observed)

=============================================================================
ARCHETYPE CARDS (§D — from FALSIFIER_FIELD_BOOK_FOR_FABLE.md)
=============================================================================

Six hold archetypes × {patience, trim_review, exit_review, cadence}.
FFB-R3 amendments: TEVA excluded from recovery-speed prior (1,929-day outlier);
CVNA and OKTA are refusal-driven non-adjudications (FFB-R3 partition).
FFB-R9 card copy: margin compression magnitude does not separate outcomes;
inventory/RPO build requires a second independent demand-or-cash fact;
Item 5.02 and Form 4 never fire alone; acquisition/scope → unverifiable.

=============================================================================
A1 FIVE QUESTIONS (from brainstorm §A1)
=============================================================================

The packet header answers the five A1 questions as defined in
research/LONG_HOLD_LOBE_BRAINSTORM_FOR_FABLE.md §A1:

  1. Has the tactical entry clock expired?
  2. What was the latest fundamental confirmation date?
  3. Which predeclared falsifiers fired, and on what filing?
  4. Which required observables are overdue or unavailable?
  5. What is the next scheduled or event-driven evidence window?

=============================================================================
FFB-R2 COVERAGE COPY (verbatim — must appear in every packet header)
=============================================================================

"Advance review in 7 of 12 studied true breaks; 5 of 12 were visible only
coincident with the break. A6 is a hard-stop bus, not a lead generator."

=============================================================================
EXPECTATION-BURDEN AXIS
=============================================================================

Descriptive only. No implied growth, no CAGR, no targets. (LHB-R4 W3 lock)

EV/sales vs own 5-year filed range:
  ordinary   — below 80th percentile of own annual history
  stretched  — 80th to 95th percentile of own annual history
  extreme    — above 95th percentile of own annual history
  unverifiable — fewer than 3 datapoints or missing data

If a delivery_waterfall row exists for the ticker, the residual leg
(valuation/mix/accounting residual) is included as-is (display annotation
only — the label is inherited from the waterfall).
