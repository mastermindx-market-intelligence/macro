"""engine.press.research_lane — the Mastermind Research X surface.  SHIPS DARK.

W2R's distribution half (XG-W8; masterplan D14 §6, X Growth charter §1).  A
triaged research report becomes two X output shapes:

    x_post      short-form, VALUE-COMPLETE.  The claim and its receipt are IN
                THE POST; the link rides in a reply (masterplan §6: "each piece
                becomes a value-complete post, with the link in a reply or
                card — link-bearing posts tend to see softer organic reach").
    x_article   X-native long-form.  Title, standfirst, one section per
                extracted point, standing footer.

WHAT KEEPS THIS DARK — stated precisely, because "four independent locks" was
the first draft's phrasing and it overstated the independence:

TWO EXTERNAL FACTS (not code, and not ours to enforce):
  A. THE X ACCOUNT DOES NOT EXIST.  There is no @handle for Mastermind Research
     (X Growth charter §1: "*(not created yet)*", operator lever §7.1).
  B. NO BUFFER CHANNEL.  `publish.channels` carries no `mastermind_research`
     entry, so even an enqueued item has no posting address.

TWO CODE LOCKS, and they are NOT independent of each other:
  1. desk_network SAYS NO, TWICE.  `enabled: false` (the account model's intent
     key) AND `disabled: true` (the legacy per-account kill switch some older
     call sites still read directly).  Both, for exactly the reason
     mastermind_news carries both: the publish-time lanes once filtered on
     `disabled` ALONE, which made a dark property postable.
  2. THIS MODULE REFUSES TO ENQUEUE.  `build_items` returns `state="dark"` with
     an empty item list unless the account is enabled.  `enqueue=True` on a dark
     account is a no-op that says so.

     BOTH READ THE SAME RESOLVER.  Lock 2 asks engine.marketing.accounts, which
     is where lock 1's config keys are interpreted — so they are one mechanism
     read twice, not two mechanisms.  In particular
     `data/marketing/account_overrides.json` sets `enabled` AFTER config, so a
     single override entry `{"mastermind_research": {"enabled": true}}` flips
     BOTH at once.  That file is the documented operator lever and it is the
     right design; it is named here so nobody reads "two locks" as "two things
     an operator must edit".  With A and B still true an override cannot
     actually post anything — but it WOULD start building and queueing items for
     an account with no channel, so an override on this id is worth seeing in
     ops.

NO HAND-ROLLED WRITER.  Items are built with `outbox.make_item` and checked with
`outbox.validate_item` — the canonical path, which is what carries the id-dedup,
exact-text dedup and near-duplicate guards.  XG-W2 spent a whole wave deleting
the two raw-file writers that bypassed it; this lane does not add a third.

NO NEW OUTBOX KIND.  Both shapes are `kind="education"` — the analyst/explainer
register the mastermind_research persona already tilts toward, and expression
dial level 1 ("analysis"), which is what a research property posts.  The house
rule is explicit (tests/test_marketing_desk_feeds.py: "NO NEW KINDS. A franchise
maps onto a kind the outbox already admits"), and a new kind would need an
expression-dial level, a tilt entry on every account and a sentinel cap review
before it could carry a single post.  `source.format` distinguishes the two
shapes for any consumer that cares.

NO LLM.  Every character of copy here is composed deterministically from the
vault's own `summary_points` — our analyst extraction, already fact-anchored.
Nothing is originated, so there is nothing for the fact-anchor law to catch.
The shared copywriter banned-vocabulary guard (charter §2 amendment 12: "one
vocab guard, every drafter") screens the result anyway, because a lane that
trusts its own inputs is how the $AVGO post reached the queue.

    only "does it FIT" (character budget); admission — value_gate's `gift` leg,
    armed the same day — asks "is there a POST here at all" (a word floor).  A
    report whose first fitting point was four words therefore produced a draft
    that the gate then abstained on, and the post was lost even when point two
    was a full paragraph.  Neither stage was wrong on its own; they were reading
    different definitions, and the lane paid for it in silence.

    So selection now applies the gate's own floor as a PREFERENCE: walk for the

    re-declared, so raising it in one place moves both stages together.  If no

    double quotes swapped for single, and a silent mid-title truncation with no
    ellipsis — and attributed the result to the institution.  Every one of those

    manufacturing a quote, which is precisely the line AM-R4 draws.

         silent cut.  It may be shortened only at a WORD BOUNDARY and only with
         a visible ellipsis, which is the ordinary journalistic mark for "this
         is where the quotation stops".
      2. That candidate must fit the budget AND clear the shared vocabulary
         guard.  A source title carrying an em dash cannot be quoted on X at
         all, because normalising it would falsify it.
      3. Otherwise DROP THE QUOTATION MARKS and say something true in our own
         words: `<Institution>'s latest note on <topic>`, where <topic> is OUR
         filing label, not their prose.
