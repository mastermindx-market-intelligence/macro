"""engine.marketing.outbox — Posting-queue contract for the D02 desk network.

Contract:
  * Producers call enqueue() to append item records to items.jsonl.
  * Only the actuator (scripts/marketing_actuator.py or W1 publisher) may call
    transition()/apply_decisions() to advance statuses in status_ledger.jsonl.
  * Admin/operator decisions are recorded via record_decision(); the actuator
    then applies them as transitions.
  * Caps are OWNED by D08 Sentinel (config/marketing.yml sentinel: block).
    This module never hardcodes its own cap — see effective_cap().

Storage layout (all paths relative to repo root; written ONLY through this module):
  data/marketing/outbox/items.jsonl          — append-only item records
  data/marketing/outbox/status_ledger.jsonl  — append-only status transitions
  data/marketing/outbox/decisions.jsonl      — operator approve/hold decisions
  data/marketing/outbox/activity.jsonl       — append-only pipeline activity
                                               (emit summaries, actuator runs)
  data/marketing/outbox/media/<as_of>/<chart_id>.svg  — chart snapshots

Concurrency: the nightly emitter and the operator-run actuator can touch these
files from separate processes on the same host. All read-check-append sections
take a best-effort advisory flock on <outbox>/.lock — fail-soft: if the lock
cannot be acquired within ~2s we proceed unlocked with a warning rather than
deadlocking a fail-soft pipeline.

This is display-tier ops state — not a forward signal ledger.  Items describe
what the actuator should post; the ledger records what actually happened.  The
gauntlet does not apply here; nulls are the honest initial state.

# Status machine — only these transitions are legal.
#
# "posting" is the in-flight state the W1 live publisher
# (scripts/marketing_publisher.py) sets AFTER an item is approved but BEFORE
# the network call, so a crash mid-post leaves a durable "posting" marker that
# is REPORTED and never auto-reposted (no-double-post guarantee). approved may
# still go straight to posted/failed so the W0 dry-run actuator and its tests
# keep working — the extra target is purely additive.
#
# "posted" IS OVERLOADED, and naming that is the whole reason `recalled` exists.
# It means "the backend accepted this post", NOT "this post is live on X". Since
# publish.max_forward_book_min (#3913) a single sweep books items as Buffer
# customScheduled sends up to an hour out, so a `posted` item may be nothing more
# than a reservation in Buffer's queue. On 2026-07-28 five such reservations
# survived the operator's kill switch by 41 minutes.
#
# "recalled" is where such a booking goes once it has been CANCELLED at the
# backend before it ever sent (scripts/marketing_recall.py). Design constraints,
# each load-bearing:
#   * posted → recalled is the ONLY new edge. `posted` stays otherwise terminal:
#     a sent post can never walk back to approved/queued and re-send.
#   * recalled is TERMINAL. Recall is not a re-queue — the operator recalls
#     because the copy was wrong, and the fix is new copy under a new id, not a
#     second attempt at the same text. Nothing may re-arm a recalled item.
#   * NOTHING may transition to recalled without a CONFIRMED backend delete. The
#     runner's rule is: booked send time still in the future AND
#     DeleteResult.ok. A post that already went out stays `posted` forever, so
#     posted_today_by_account keeps counting it and the no-double-post
#     guarantee is untouched.

    That was already live before the Buffer plan lock — the requeue branch's own
    comment called it a "KNOWN COST, ACCEPTED" — and the lock turned it from a
    rare edge into the default: every item that rode the outage accumulated
    failure rows for a reason no human would call a failure. The bounded requeue

    the exact-text dedup keys on it, and :func:`near_duplicate` tokenizes it. The
    fast lanes (press_lane, fastlane) used to carry ``{"headline":…, "body":…}``
    in that slot, which is not merely unsupported — it silently DEFEATS the
    guards (``_normalize_text`` raises on a dict, and a stringified dict
    tokenizes the schema key names alongside the copy). Routing those lanes
    through the canonical path is only worth anything if the text they carry is
    the text the guards can see.

    ``"\\n\\n".join`` is the house convention, not a new one: ``admin/marketing.py``
    already reconstructs a plan post's outbox text as headline + blank line +
    body when it joins usage back onto the plan. Producers that want the two
    halves separately readable keep them as top-level ``headline``/``body``.

    A BODY THAT ALREADY SAYS THE HEADLINE IS ONE COMPOSITION, NOT TWO. Four
    shipped breaking items (``ob-2026-08-01-170b51e475``,
    ``ob-2026-08-01-c3d08a7993``, ``ob-2026-08-02-e731cc12b9``,
    ``ob-2026-08-03-6e554a3eb1``) carried their own headline twice inside one

        Fed's Williams: central bank very committed to returning inflation to 2%

        On the tape: Fed's Williams: central bank very committed to returning
        inflation to 2%

    The upstream cause is `breaking_summary._deterministic_summary`, whose
    documented fallback relay is ``"{headline} -- {source_name}"`` — an honest
    WHOLE POST when the headline is all the packet gave us, and a duplicate the
    moment somebody joins it BEHIND that same headline. press_lane gates it
    today (`wire_format.wire_post_shape` returns short_form, which blanks the
    headline), but THE GATE LIVES IN THE CALLER: `fastlane` and
    `engine/press/research_lane` join here with no gate at all, so the defect
    is one new call site away from returning. The join is the seam, so the join
    refuses — it emits the body alone, which is the enriched half (it carries
    the opener and the source clause), and is byte-identical to what the
    downstream gate produces today.

    The test is verbatim CONTAINMENT of a substantial headline, not a coverage
    ratio: a body that merely shares vocabulary with line 1 is untouched, and a
    short label headline ("$AAPL") can never collapse a legitimate two-line
    post. Fuzzy restatement stays where it already lives — `wire_format`'s

    ARMING IS PER-KIND, BECAUSE THE EVIDENCE IS PER-KIND (2026-07-30).
    `value_gate.py`'s own PRE-ARMING REQUIREMENT is that the regression corpus
    cover the kinds enforcement will police, and it names the reason: a gate
    armed on the kinds that happened to be in one nightly plan is "validated on
    the generator it polices". The measured corpus
    (`data/marketing/outbox/items.jsonl`, 154 stamped emissions) covers eight
    kinds. It does not cover `wire`, `earnings`, `receipt`, `reply` or `news` —
    for those the honest count of observations is ZERO, and a global boolean
    would silence them on no evidence at all.

    So `enforce` arms only the kinds listed in `value_gate.enforce_kinds`. An
    emission of any other kind keeps its verdict RECORDED and ships, and the
    caller announces the unmeasured kind so it stops being unmeasured. This is
    the same posture the repo takes everywhere else: display-tier freely,
    authority only where it was earned.

    # be its own news. A brief is the opposite shape: the designed SECOND HALF
    # of one publish, which exists only because its parent alert already POSTED
    # and which says why that post mattered. It is supposed to share the fact —
    # that is the feature.
    #
    # The exemption cannot become a fan-out hole, because the brief lane caps
    # itself upstream: the radar's `pending_briefs` files at most ONE brief per
    # alert event key (`if HT.brief_key(key) in done: continue`), only for an
    # alert that reached "posted", and only inside a delay window. So the count
    # this guard protects — one fact, one post per day — becomes one fact, one
    # alert plus its one brief. Any OTHER trigger dressing the same fact is
    # still refused.

    rejection — a picture nobody will ever see, charged against a nightly render
    budget that is law (~67 min, 4-core-bound). The deciding text always exists
    before the render; only the ordering was wrong. Callers keep their own
    account of that; this function stays generic, and deliberately knows nothing
    about which program calls it.

    FAIL-OPEN BY CONSTRUCTION. Any error returns "ok", so a preflight that
    cannot read the corpus costs a wasted render at worst and can never become a
    publish outage. It is an optimisation, not a gate: `enqueue` still runs every
    one of these checks under the outbox lock, which is where the answer is

    Mutates `item` in place — deliberately: the caller keeps the dict it queued
    (the governor lanes log and index off it), and a copy corrected only on the
    persisted row would leave the caller's state disagreeing with the ledger
    about when its own post goes out. Because the mutation is visible to the
    caller, :func:`enqueue` calls this only AFTER the duplicate/cap checks have
    passed — see the call site for why a rejected item must come back untouched.

    THE DEFECT (X Growth audit, 2026-07-31): 41 items in one week carried a
    `scheduled_at` EARLIER than their own `created_at` — a slot ladder resolved
    against the content date while the run itself happened hours later, so an
    item created 15:46Z was booked for 13:00Z the same day. It poisons every
    "was this late?" measurement downstream: an item can be nine hours overdue
    the instant it is written, so lateness stops measuring the pipeline and
    starts measuring the ladder's arithmetic.

    WHAT THIS DOES **NOT** FIX (stated plainly because an earlier draft of this
    docstring claimed it, adversarial review 2026-07-31). Clamping to
    `created_at` moves the due time from "hours before the item existed" to "the
    moment the item existed" — which is still in the PAST by the time any
    publish sweep sees it. The item is therefore still due-now, still lands in
    the same undifferentiated backlog, and a batch of them still drains
    back-to-back. Only the LATENESS MEASUREMENT is repaired here. What actually
    spaces the burst is the publisher's own `min_minutes_between_posts` floor;
    what would prevent it is a lane that books an honest future slot.

    THE CLAMP IS TO `created_at`, NOT TO A LATER LADDER SLOT. Choosing the next
    free slot needs the whole day's ladder occupancy, which this function has no
    business knowing and no lock over; creation time is the earliest moment the
    post could honestly have gone out. The original value is preserved in
    `source.scheduled_at_original` so a lane emitting bad slots stays diagnosable
    rather than being silently tidied up.

#
# THE WINDOW IS INVARIANT ACROSS EVERY WIDENING — 4:00 AM–5:30 PM, three ladders
# running (19 slots @45min 2026-07-27 → 28 @30min 2026-07-28 → 55 @15min now).
# Only the STEP tightens, so no post ever moves into low-engagement hours and the
# LAST rung stays at exactly 17:30 PT. That last property is load-bearing:
# publish_time_content._after_close_slot() derives the after-close read's slot as
# `max(_LADDER_PT_TIMES, key=clock)`, so a ladder change that moved the final rung
# would silently move the daily read. 55 (not 56) is chosen for exactly this
# reason — 4:00 AM + 54*15min = 17:30 PT lands on the nose, where a 56th rung
# would push the tail to 17:45.
#
# WHY 55 RUNGS. `content_studio.ladder_shape_for` sizes a desk's day as
# ceil(cap × per_day_headroom) clamped to this ladder, and the clamp was the
# binding constraint: every desk sits at cap 30 × headroom 2.0 = 60, clamped to
# 28, and ~65% survival through the reuse budget/cooldowns/near-dup gates left
# ~18 posts/day against a 20/day operator floor. At 55 the clamp stops binding
# (~36 survivors) and the daily cap becomes the constraint, which is where the
# control belongs.
#
# Slot NUMBERS therefore point at different clock times than they did (old S9 was
# 8:00, new S9 is 6:00). Nothing in flight moves: outbox items carry an absolute

    Contract §Emit. A `queued`/`approved` item whose `scheduled_at` is more than
    ``max_age_hours`` in the past is a post about a tape that no longer exists —
    it was written against a close two nights ago and the plan that replaces it
    is being emitted RIGHT NOW. Left alone it either ships stale (the publisher
    happily posts anything approved and due) or clogs the admin queue with
    yesterday's rejects, and its text keeps vetoing tonight's copy through the
    7-day near-dup corpus.

    `expired` is deliberately NOT a new ledger status: TRANSITIONS is a safety
    contract and widening it for a housekeeping case would cost more than it
    buys. The item goes to `quarantined` (terminal, already reachable from both
    live statuses) with the note "expired: superseded by tonight's plan", so the
    admin's quarantine view carries the reason verbatim.

    SCOPED TO `content_studio` PROVENANCE. The wire lanes (press/fastlane) and
    weekend_levels manage their own retirement, and quarantining another lane's
    items from the nightly emit path would be this lane reaching into theirs.

    PROVENANCE IS THE WHOLE SCOPE — there is no kind filter (2026-08-06). There
    used to be one (`kind in planned_kinds()`), and it silently exempted the two
    kinds content_studio emits that are not planned kinds: `mover` and
    `theme_list`. Those were also missing from `approval_desk.kinds` and are
    skipped by `_auto_approve_pass` (which demands provenance
    `publisher_live_movers`), so nothing decided them and nothing retired them.
    Measured before the fix: two nightly theme_list items sat `queued` SIXTY
    hours past their slot, still offering the operator an Approve button on a
    two-day-old tape. A reaper whose scope is "this lane's items" must not carry
    a second, narrower scope that quietly disagrees with it.

    ``exempt_ids``: ids this sweep must leave alone whatever their age. Same
    contract, and the same reason, as :func:`expire_stale_wire`'s — the
    publisher now runs this reaper on every sweep (see its call site), and
    without the exemption an operator's ``--post-now`` on a planned item that
    took a while to get a human decision would be self-defeating: the run
    summoned to send it would quarantine it, TERMINALLY, on the way in.

    Uses the canonical writer (`transition`) on a single pre-folded snapshot, the
    same batch pattern supersede_lane uses — never a hand-appended ledger row.
    Never raises: expiry failing must not stop tonight's emission.

    """The moment the wire reaper's idle clock starts. None when nothing parses.

    "Born" is IDLE-birth, not creation: the clock restarts every time somebody
    touches the item, so what the TTL measures is "how long has this sat with
    nobody doing anything about it", never "how long since it was written".

    NOT ``scheduled_at``: every lane in :data:`_WIRE_PROVENANCES` enqueues with
    the literal string ``"immediate"``, which is exactly why
    :func:`expire_stale_planned` — whose age comes from ``scheduled_at`` and
    whose first act on an immediate row is ``continue`` ("no slot to be late
    for") — could never have retired one of these even had the provenance
    matched.

    THE PRECEDENCE DEFECT (adversarial review, 2026-07-31). This function used
    to read ``created_at`` FIRST and fall through to the ledger only when it was
    missing — and :func:`make_item` ALWAYS stamps ``created_at``. So the ledger
    rung was dead code for every real item, and the docstring's own promise
    ("an item an operator touched five minutes ago is treated as five minutes
    old, not eight hours") was unreachable in production. Reproduced: item
    created 14:00Z, operator approved it 17:59Z, the 18:00Z sweep quarantined it
    — TERMINALLY, one minute after a human said ship it. The documented
    mitigation existed only in the fixture shapes the tests invented.

    Ladder, newest-touch first:
      1. the LATEST of (last APPLIED ledger row ``at``, latest decision row
         ``at``) — ANY activity restarts the clock. Both logs matter and neither
         subsumes the other: an operator's approve/hold lands in
         ``decisions.jsonl`` IMMEDIATELY, while the matching ledger row is only
         written when :func:`apply_decisions` next runs, so an item approved
         between the decision and the actuator has a fresh decision row and a
         stale (or absent) ledger row. Taking the max is what makes a
         human/desk touch — ``admin``/``operator`` decisions, the
         ``approval-desk`` and ``actuator`` transitions — reset the clock by
         itself, which is the whole point of this fix;
      2. ``created_at`` — stamped by make_item; the honest birth time, and the
         right answer for an item NOBODY has touched (the AMZN/COIN movers had
         zero ledger rows at 8h, which is exactly the stall this reaper exists
         for);
      3. ``as_of`` at 00:00Z — a date-only floor for pre-stamp rows.

    Returning None (nothing parsed) means the item is NEVER expired. A malformed
    stamp must not be the reason a post is destroyed — the same rule
    _item_age_days states in the publisher.

    THE DEFECT. :func:`expire_stale_planned` is scoped to ``content_studio``
    provenance, and the note above it says why: "the wire lanes (press/fastlane)
    and weekend_levels manage their own retirement". They do not. Nothing in
    this repo sweeps an item from any of the lanes in :data:`_WIRE_PROVENANCES`,
    so a breaking/mover row that no ``--post-now`` batch happened to select sits
    `queued` FOREVER. Measured on 2026-07-31: the AMZN and COIN movers created
    at 15:32:53Z carried ZERO status-ledger rows eight hours later — their copy
    says "right now" about a tape that closed — and the operator's audit had to
    quarantine them by hand alongside 14 older siblings.

    Two separate reasons the planned reaper could never have covered them, both
    load-bearing: the provenance filter, AND the ``scheduled_at == "immediate"``
    skip, which every one of these rows trips (see :func:`_wire_item_born_at`).

    TTL IS PER KIND (:data:`_WIRE_TTL_HOURS_BY_KIND`) because perishability is:
    a `breaking` alert and a `mover` claim are five-minute facts, the
    publish-time daily read is not. Ages from IDLE TIME, not from a slot
    (a wire item has no slot) and not from creation — any touch in the ledger or
    the decisions log restarts the clock; see :func:`_wire_item_born_at`.

    ``exempt_ids``: ids this sweep must leave alone whatever their age. The
    publisher passes its ``--post-now`` set, because the reaper runs BEFORE
    post-now id resolution and would otherwise let the very run summoned to
    dispatch a breaking item quarantine it on the way in.

    `expired` is not a new ledger status, for the same reason expire_stale_planned
    gives: TRANSITIONS is a safety contract. The item goes to `quarantined`
    (terminal, reachable from both live statuses) with the note
    ``expired_stale_wire: …`` so the admin quarantine view carries the reason
    verbatim and is greppable.

    Returns {"expired": n, "ids": [...], "by_kind": {kind: n}}. Never raises:
    housekeeping failing must not stop a dispatch.

    65/65 deterministic-template output and the operator aborted review at post
    15; every patch before this one added another banned word to a list the

    items still are not model copy" — the operator needs to know which.

    Reads items.jsonl ONCE for the whole batch (enqueue _ctx snapshot) and

# W5 — the dead-session reaper (operator 2026-08-08)
#
# APPENDED, NOT WOVEN IN, and deliberately so: two sibling waves are mid-merge
# on this file, so this wave adds its helpers at the end rather than editing the
# expiry section above.
#
# THE GAP THE TWO REAPERS ABOVE LEAVE. `expire_stale_planned` ages off
# `scheduled_at` (36h) and `expire_stale_wire` ages off idle time (3h/12h).
# NEITHER ASKS THE CALENDAR. The operator's Saturday outbox held a Friday-morning
# theme_list reading "Consumer Goods selling off, -2.4% avg on Thursday" that was
# 29 hours old (inside the 36h bar), carried a real ladder slot, and could never
# post on any day: its kind means "the tape right now" and there is no tape on a
# Saturday. It was visible, it offered an Approve button, and the operator has
# asked ~10 times for it to stop happening.
#
# AND IT ONLY EVER RAN BEHIND THE PUBLISHER. Both reapers above are called from
# the publish sweep and the nightly emit. With MARKETING_PUBLISH_ENABLED=0 the
# publish sweep does not run, so no expiry was ever COMMITTED and the queue
# rotted in plain sight. `scripts/marketing_press_wire.py` calls this function on
# its ~5-minute tick, which is the lane that commits regardless of the send
# switch.

        theme_list, live-lane breaking) sitting on a non-trading day. Its
        session has passed and the posting day has no session at all, so there

        battery the publisher runs at dispatch, run here so the verdict lands in
        the ledger even when no dispatch is coming.

    THE SECOND LEG JUDGES DUE ITEMS ONLY. Every clock violation is monotone
    except the overnight frame, which is legal again at the next pre-open: an
    item written Sunday night for a Monday 08:00 slot says "overnight" honestly
    at its slot and dishonestly at 20:00 Sunday. Waiting for the slot costs
    nothing (a due item is what the publisher would be looking at anyway) and it
    is the difference between a reaper and a shredder.

    Idempotent: a retired item is no longer `queued`/`approved`, so the next
    tick skips it. Never posts, never touches the network, never raises.
