"""engine.marketing.intelligence_context — Intelligence Desk V2 §D.3.

Program: **Intelligence Desk V2** (``research/agentic_media/
INTELLIGENCE_DESK_V2_BY_FABLE.md``), acceptance gate D.3 and the §2 payload
contract's ``engine_context`` rows.

WHAT THIS IS
------------
A desk story names tickers. This module joins those tickers against the
REPO-COMMITTED engine artifacts the rest of the marketing lobe already reads —
congressional disclosures, Form-4 insider filings, and the earnings calendar —
and turns the hits into at most three plain bilingual lines::

    {"kind": "congress", "line_en": "Congress: 2 buy filings on NVDA in the "
                                    "past 45 days",
     "line_zh": "国会：过去 45 天 NVDA 有 2 笔买入披露",
     "as_of": "2026-07-27"}

**NO LLM ANYWHERE IN THIS MODULE.** These are engine facts. They are counted
from artifact rows, phrased by a fixed template in both languages, and stamped
with the artifact's own date. The phrasing pass
(``engine.marketing.intelligence_llm``) never sees them and never writes them.

THE FRESHNESS LAW (gate D.3)
----------------------------
A stale artifact is SKIPPED, never served as a fresh fact. Every row that
contributes to a line must carry its own date inside ``fresh_days`` of the
tick's clock, so an artifact that stopped updating produces no line at all
rather than a confident sentence about last quarter. That is not hypothetical:
``data/earnings/earnings.parquet`` is mostly a 2026-06-19 read today (3 of 1364
rows refreshed), and the per-row ``as_of`` gate is what keeps the other 1361
off the desk.

A count is only ever taken across rows from ONE artifact read. Nothing here
combines a number from one as_of with a number from another.

IMPORT-CLOSURE LAW
------------------
**stdlib only at module import.** ``pandas``, ``congress_feed`` and
``insider_feed`` are imported lazily inside the loaders: the thin
marketing-engine CI lane has no pandas, and the desk's own import closure is
stdlib-only so the 75-second daemon can always import it. Every loader is
fail-soft — a missing file, an unreadable frame, or no pandas at all returns an
empty list and the caller simply attaches no context.
