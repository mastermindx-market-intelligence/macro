"""engine.marketing.press_lane — pure, testable tick body for the press wire lane.

Processes a batch of press FeedItems (from press_providers.poll_all + the wire RSS
lane) through the full pipeline:

    satire blocklist -> relevance score -> corroboration gate -> flagship top-K/floor
    -> summarize-with-citation -> emit kind="breaking" outbox item (scheduled_at="immediate")

Reuses the existing display-tier machinery:
    breaking_relevance.score_item      deterministic salience / event_class / tickers
    breaking_summary.build_breaking_payload   LLM summarize-with-citation + card
    press_corroboration.corroboration_decision   the §3 gate

XG-W2 moved this lane onto the CANONICAL outbox path — outbox.make_item() ->
outbox.validate_item() -> outbox.enqueue() — so it inherits the id-dedup,
text-dedup, same-account near-dup and cross-account near-dup guards it used to
bypass by writing its own data/marketing/outbox/<id>.json (a shape nothing read:
the publisher folds items.jsonl). It still rides the SAME #3478 breaking dispatch
rail (scheduled_at="immediate" -> publisher._is_immediate -> Buffer
customScheduled). The earnings fast lane moved in the same wave and by the same
route, so the two shapes stay identical.

Two XG-W2 gates run BEFORE any LLM spend: the account is resolved per item by
wire_routing (no module-level account constant), and the one-conversation-one-
owner story lock refuses a claim another account already took.

Public API:
    run_press_tick(items, *, root, now, cfg, press_cfg, state, dry_run=False,
                   spool=False, llm_override=None) -> dict
        {emitted:[...], skipped:[...], digest:[...], blocked:[...]}

State (daemon-local, gitignored — data/marketing/press/; the Actions lane
commits the same dict to data/marketing/press_wire/cursors.json):
    state["flagship_counter"]  = {"day": "YYYY-MM-DD", "count": N}
        the PRIMARY desk's row, kept for the committed-cursors contract
    state["wire_day_counts"]   = {"day": "YYYY-MM-DD", "counts": {account: N}}
        W4d: the per-desk daily wire budget ledger. Each desk draws its own
        stricter-of(top-K, ramp cap) budget instead of sharing one counter that
        was named for one account while bounding all of them.
    state["wire_headroom"]     = {"day": ..., "spilled": {"a->b": N},
                                  "exhausted": N}
        W4d: the COUNTED drops. `exhausted` is items that cleared every quality
        gate and were dropped only because no live wire desk had budget left.
        Persisted, not local — a silent `continue` is how twelve nights of
        mover posts disappeared. `spilled` counts ROUTING DECISIONS, not
        emissions: an item can be handed to another desk here and still be
        refused downstream by the story lock or the queue, which is why the
        budget itself is charged at the emission, never here.
    state["transient_refusals"] = {emission_key: consecutive_env_refusals}
    (the seen-ledger + provider cursors live in the same state file, owned by the
     daemon; this module only reads/advances the counters above, the
     corroboration window and the transient-refusal retry tally.)

#: Refusal reasons that are a property of the ENVIRONMENT, not of the copy.
#:
#: A TRANSIENT REFUSAL MUST NOT ENTER A PERMANENT LEDGER (adversarial review,
#: 2026-07-31). Everything else `_emit_outbox_item` can refuse — invalid item,
#: banned language, a duplicate, a near-dup, a cap — is decided by the generated
#: TEXT and gives the same answer on every retry, which is why the caller marks
#: those seen. ``media_unhosted`` is not in that class: it fires when the Chrome
#: raster loses a race, when the R2 upload blips, when boto3 or the R2_* creds
#: are missing on the host. One flaky raster on a breaking cashtag story used to
#: bury that story for the whole life of the seen ledger, and the LLM spend that
#: produced its copy bought nothing.
_TRANSIENT_REFUSALS: frozenset[str] = frozenset({
    "media_unhosted",
    # The renderer fell through its outer fail-soft, so a ticker post has no

    # read its docstring before reclassifying this as environmental.
    "card_render_degraded",
})

#: Consecutive transient refusals after which a reason GIVES UP and falls
#: through to the terminal branch (mark seen, name the reason in the census).
#: A reason absent from this map retries without bound.
#:
#: WHY card_render_degraded IS BOUNDED AND media_unhosted IS NOT (round-3 review,
#: finding 6). `media_unhosted` is genuinely environmental: it fires on a lost
#: Chrome raster, an R2 blip, absent boto3 or R2_* creds, and during a real
#: outage EVERY story is refused — giving up would convert a five-minute outage
#: into a mass kill, which is the defect the transient class was created to fix.
#: `card_render_degraded` names something else: render_breaking_card's outer
#: blanket `except Exception` around a DETERMINISTIC pure-Python layout over the
#: same stored strings. An unexpected glyph, a malformed ticker row or a missing
#: logo asset therefore raises identically on every tick — the story is never
#: marked seen, and each attempt re-pays the summarize_item LLM call. It was
#: classed as "an ENVIRONMENT fault, same class as a lost raster" on no evidence.
#: Five ticks (~25 minutes of the press daemon) rides out anything that varies
#: between renders and stops a deterministic renderer bug from holding one story
#: and billing an LLM call for the life of the process.
_TRANSIENT_GIVE_UP_AT: dict[str, int] = {"card_render_degraded": 5}

#: Consecutive transient refusals of the SAME story before the lane alarms. A
#: retry loop that never surfaces is the other half of the same fault: a host
#: that is genuinely down (no creds, no boto3) would otherwise re-render, re-pay
#: and re-refuse the same item every tick in silence. Three ticks is the press
#: daemon's ~15 minutes — long enough to ride out a raster blip, short enough
#: that a real outage lands in the Actions summary the same hour.
_TRANSIENT_RETRY_ALARM_AT = 3

#: Cap on the per-story retry tally carried in daemon state. Bounded like every
#: other ledger here: the counter exists to spot a stuck story, not to be a
#: history. Oldest entries (insertion order) are dropped first.

#: Wire emissions allowed PER WIRE DESK PER DAY. A VOLUME CAP, not a quality
#: gate — which item may go out is decided by `flagship_salience_floor`, the

#: those moved when this number did (W4d, 2026-08-02).
#:
#: WAS 3, AND 3 WAS NOT MEASURED. It is now, by replaying the real backlog —
#: 438 live items polled from the six `breaking.sources` RSS feeds plus the two
#: free Truth mirrors on 2026-08-02 — through this function in hourly ticks with
#: the daemon's own clocks:
#:
#:   day        candidates  above-floor (cash-session clock)  emitted at K=3
#:   2026-07-30      20            2                                2

#:
#: TWO THINGS THAT REPLAY SAYS, AND BOTH BELONG HERE. First, on most days the
#: binding constraint is SUPPLY, not this counter: ~45% of the daily ingest is a
#: mirror duplicate and nearly all of the rest scores under the 30.0 floor, so
#: the lane emits 1-2/day with `flagship_top_k_reached` never once firing.
#: Raising this number does not manufacture volume and must not be sold as
#: though it does. Second, it DOES bind on the busy days — 2026-08-02 cleared 6
#: above the floor off a PARTIAL day's 43 candidates, so K=3 would have dropped
#: half of them, and it would have dropped them into a `continue` whose count
#: nothing persisted.
#:
#: WHY 10. Bounded from above by flagship's own ramp cap: `sentinel.ramp.
#: account_overrides.flagship.max_posts_per_account_per_day` is 20, and the wire
#: must not be able to consume a desk's whole day — the nightly ladder and the
#: publish-time lanes draw from the same 20. Half is the operator-legible split.
#: Bounded from below by the measured supply: 10 covers the highest observed
#: above-floor day (6) with headroom, and covers a full weekday extrapolated
#: from 2026-08-02's 14% above-floor rate on ~95 candidates (~13) at ~75%.
#: It is >3x the masterplan §8.0 per-account acceptance floor.
#:
#: PER DESK, NOT PER NETWORK (this is the fix to the XG-W2 TODO at step 5). The
#: pre-W4d counter was global while being named for one account, so the moment
#: mastermind_news armed it would have shared flagship's 3/day and the wire desk
#: would have starved the flagship rather than adding to it.

    The gate behind compose-or-drop. Reached only when the summarizer produced
    nothing but the headline back, and only after the macro-print composer has
    declined the item — so "no" here means the item does not post at all.

    TWO WAYS TO EARN IT, and both say the same thing in different registers: the
    sentence stands WITHOUT our composition and without trusting whoever handed
    it to us.

      * AN ATTRIBUTED PRIMARY-SOURCE QUOTE. `corroboration_class ==
        "direct-quote"` is set by exactly two providers (the Truth Social
        mirrors) and means the source IS the speaker — the headline is not a
        publisher's line ABOUT an event, it is the event. "TRUMP: <the post> --
        on Truth Social" is the oldest legitimate shape a wire desk has.
      * A CHECKABLE MARKET STATEMENT: `source_authority.self_evident` says the
        claim rests on a figure rather than on the relayer's standing, AND the
        headline actually carries that figure. "GOLD ROSE ABOUT 0.6% TO AROUND
        $4,070 AN OUNCE" and "S. KOREAN TRADE BALANCE ACTUAL 30.32B (FORECAST
        29.487B)" are facts in wire shorthand; nothing we could compose would
        make them truer, and the reader can pull both off the tape.

    BOTH GATES ARE NEEDED, and the second half is why. `self_evident` was
    written to answer "may this post with NO CREDIT", and on its own it is too
    generous for this question: it returns True for "Wendy's Q2 Beat Comes with
    Dividend Cut, Withdrawn Outlook as Sales Slump" — a publisher's editorial
    headline whose only digit is a quarter label — because a slump reads as a

    stopped there. Nothing in press_lane.py or breaking_summary.py ever called
    `rasterize_svg` or `media_publish.publish_card`, so every press item shipped a
    media[] entry with no `media_url` — and Buffer/X can only attach a HOSTED
    image (`_media_paths_for` skips non-http paths). The card was rendered,
    committed and unreachable: every press post went out text-only, and a press
    item carrying a cashtag was permanently unpostable (the publisher quarantines
    a bare cashtag post — "YOU WILL NOT SHIP THESE TEXT ONLY"). The publish
    workflow has pip-installed boto3 since 159537bcfe for exactly this call.

    ONE SEAM: `media_publish.publish_card` is the same function the hot-tape lane
    goes through (`hot_tape_radar.resolve_chart`), so the posted PNG is a raster
    of the SAME SVG the admin preview shows — the 2026-07-26 drift incident's
    rule. The hot-tape card contract is copied exactly: `media_url`,
    `media_png_path` and `media_render` land on the media entry.

    FAIL-SOFT BY CONSTRUCTION: `publish_card` never raises, and the try/except is
    the second belt — a missing Chrome, absent R2 credentials or a boto3-less
    checkout must degrade the PICTURE, never take down the wire lane. A False
    return puts the caller back on exactly the pre-fix behaviour (local SVG only)

    evidence: the value gate's `hard` proof rung, and the publisher's
    bare-cashtag quarantine. Both would then kill a post the card law only meant
    to slim down — measured end to end on 2026-08-05 (no digit -> `proof:
    below_hard`, ABSTAINED; digit -> quarantined as a bare cashtag post). The
    flag is stamped onto ``source`` so the publisher, which never sees this
    function, can make the same distinction.

    # degraded-render fix in build_breaking_payload drops the blank fail-soft
    # fallback, which is right — a card nobody can read is not a card — but it
    # lands here looking exactly like a post that never wanted a picture. It is
    # not: measured on this fixture with the renderer forced through its outer
    # fail-soft, the emission shipped with media=[] and the REAL publisher gate
    # returned "$AAPL $NVDA", i.e. QUARANTINED, terminal.
    #
    # This is the SAME question the unhosted-card block below answers one step
    # later — "the copy names tickers and we have no picture" — so both reasons
    # a meant-to-be-drawn card is missing get the same answer HERE, at the lane,
    # where the skip census can name it. They differ only in whether a RETRY can
    # change the answer:
    #
    #   render_degraded  TRANSIENT (bounded — see _TRANSIENT_GIVE_UP_AT). The
    #                    renderer fell over; the next tick redraws from scratch,
    #                    so the story is not marked seen.
    #   policy_refused   NOT TRANSIENT. A foreign @handle reached a card param,
    #                    and the next tick redraws the IDENTICAL unlawful card
    #                    from the identical stored item — a retry cannot change
    #                    the answer, and re-rendering re-pays the summarize_item
    #                    LLM call to reach the same refusal. It is marked seen.

    # and enqueues its own two items (a flagship analysis post carrying the diff
    # card, and a stance-free relay).

    # history snapshot cannot fire it; before the emission loop, so the desk's
    # items are in the queue by the time this tick's own items are. The desk's
    # items never pass through the loop below — it owns its own outbox path.
    #
    # WHY IT CANNOT HURT THIS LANE. `maybe_fire` never raises (and `fire` inside
    # it is itself wrapped), this call is wrapped again, and the desk is
    # idempotent through its own statements ledger, so the every-5-minutes tick

        # items still went out in raw register on 2026-08-11, because a warning
        # that annotates a post is a RECEIPT, not a gate. The one the operator
        # screenshotted on the flagship account was a content-farm SEO listicle,
        # relayed verbatim:
        #
        #   "How To Trade SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, And TSLA
        #    Using Technical Analysis"
        #
        # WHAT THIS TEST IS, precisely. `_deterministic_summary` has two legs: the
        # source's LEAD SENTENCE when the packet carries a usable body, and the
        # bare `{headline} -- {source_name}` relay when it does not. The first is a
        # body — a different sentence, carrying information the headline does not,
        # and the D2 restatement gate still judges it. The second is not a summary
        # at all; it is the provider's headline wearing our account's name, and it
        # is what every one of the eight shipped. So the gate is keyed to the
        # SHAPE, not to the mode: if the body we are about to compose from IS the
        # headline, there is nothing here to say, and "no post" beats "bot post"
        # (Voice doctrine v5).
        #
        # TWO WAYS OUT, both deterministic rather than discretionary, and they
        # run IN THIS ORDER.
        #
        # 1. COMPOSE. A scheduled MACRO PRINT arrives in a fixed vendor grammar
        #    whose whole content is three figures, so `compose_macro_print`
        #    restates it in house register out of code, inventing nothing. This
        #    is FIRST because a print we can write ourselves should be written
        #    ourselves — "July payrolls: -23k against +85k expected." is the
        #    house voice, and "Nonfarm Payrolls For July -23K Vs 85K Est." is a
        #    vendor's. A shape that does not fully parse gets no half-rendering.
        # 2. RELAY VERBATIM, but only where the source's own sentence stands
        #    without us — an attributed primary-source quote, or a checkable
        #    market statement carrying its own reading. See
