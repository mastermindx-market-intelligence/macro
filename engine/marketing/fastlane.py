"""engine.marketing.fastlane — Pure, testable loop body for the earnings fast lane.

Processes a batch of raw earnings events through the full pipeline:
  poll → dedupe → eligibility → copy generation → validate → card render → emit outbox.

Public API:
    run_tick(events, *, root, now, universe=None) -> TickResult
    summarize_tick(TickResult) -> attributable end-of-pass counts

TickResult is a dict with three outcome lists:
    {
        "emitted":     list[dict],   # events that produced an outbox item
        "skipped":     list[dict],   # events not processed (dedupe / ineligible)
        "quarantined": list[dict],   # events processed but with copy violations
    }

Each entry in emitted / skipped / quarantined is a dict with at least:
    {"id": str, "ticker": str, "reason": str | None}

plus the attribution block a zero-emission pass needs to name its own cause:
    {
        "events_in":   int,          # candidates that entered the pass
        "universe":    {"available": bool, "size": int, "source": str},
        "summary":     summarize_tick(result),
    }
Three zeroes are not one fact — see summarize_tick.

Outbox contract (D02 → XG-W2):
    This emitter used to hand-roll `data/marketing/outbox/<id>.json` with its own
    schema ({"text": {"headline", "body"}, "priority": "high", "provenance": {…}}).
    Nothing read that file — the publisher folds items.jsonl — so every earnings
    emission also skipped the id-dedup, text-dedup and near-dup guards that live
    in outbox.enqueue().  XG-W2 moved the lane onto the canonical path:
    outbox.make_item() → outbox.validate_item() → outbox.enqueue(), kind
    "earnings" (admitted to outbox.KINDS in the same wave), text FLATTENED to the
    real post string (outbox.compose_text), the rich event record
    carried in `source`, and the account RESOLVED from the wire_routing config
    map instead of a module constant.

Ledger:
    data/marketing/fastlane_seen.jsonl is daemon-local state.  It is append-only
    and must NEVER be committed (enforced via .gitignore).  The file is loaded at
    the start of each run_tick call so deduplication survives daemon restarts.

Universe eligibility:
    When universe=None the ticker set is derived cheaply from
    site/marketdata/sp500_heatmap.json (the same source movers_source.py uses).
    An injectable universe set is used in tests to avoid filesystem reads.

                  heatmap (when universe=None), and the outbox output dirs.

                  site/marketdata/sp500_heatmap.json (cheapest read available).

                  footer without the trial button (URL lockup stays). The caller

                  outbox spool instead of the git-TRACKED items.jsonl. The VPS
                  daemon sets it so a tick cannot dirty the checkout its
                  3-minute `git pull` depends on. Read-side guards read the
                  union of both files, so nothing is weakened.
        cfg:      The full config/marketing.yml dict (XG-W2). Read for wire
                  routing, the one-owner lock window, and the cross-account
                  near-dup threshold. None (the default) keeps every one of
