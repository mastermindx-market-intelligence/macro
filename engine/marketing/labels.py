"""engine/marketing/labels.py — the ONE feedback loop (XG-W6 / IS-W5).

Four charters asked for a feedback loop and described the same machine four
times: D05 §7's wire loop, IS-W5's telemetry->labels->scorecard, Persona W4's
report card, and Media W2's scorecards. Charter §6 reconciles them into ONE
loop with four named consumers (``CONSUMERS``). This module is that loop.

    per-post telemetry  ->  labels store  ->  weekly scorecard
    (LIVE metrics poll)     (this module)     (hook x format x register x account)

**Where the telemetry actually comes from (verified in-tree 2026-07-28).**
Two pipelines exist and only one of them is fed:

  * ``scripts/marketing_metrics_poll.py`` is LIVE. It runs as a step in
    ``.github/workflows/marketing-publish.yml`` ("poll post metrics"), reads
    Buffer analytics for every recently-posted item, and the workflow commits
    ``data/marketing/post_metrics.jsonl`` back. That ledger is this module's
    post-telemetry source.
  * ``engine/marketing/telemetry.py`` (the Lab roll-up) is TEST-FED ONLY:
    ``ingest_rows`` has no production caller and ``data/marketing/telemetry/``
    does not exist in the checkout, so ``lab_rollup.json`` reports n=0 forever.
    This module deliberately does NOT write into it — a second writer racing an
    unfed store buys nothing. Bridging the Lab roll-up onto post_metrics is a
    separate, small change and is left to whoever owns that surface.

**THE NIGHTLY-SOLE-ADVANCER LAW** (charter §2 amendment 13). Intraday writers
touch only host state; a nightly consolidator is the ONLY writer of the tracked
ledgers:

    data/marketing/learning_host/labels.jsonl   gitignored, appended intraday
    data/marketing/learning/labels.jsonl        tracked, advanced by consolidate()
    data/marketing/learning/scorecard.json      tracked, written by consolidate()

``tests/test_marketing_learning.py`` carries an AST guard (modelled on XG-W3's)
asserting ``_write_tracked`` is the only path that opens a write handle under
the tracked directory, so a RENAMED intraday writer fails it too.

**NO SCORE OR LABEL IS EVER USER-FACING.** Every row here is an operator-console
artifact. Nothing in ``site/`` reads this store and nothing may.

**LLM never scores** (charter §2 amendment 9). Every field below is arithmetic
over observed counters. This module imports no model client and must not.

#: The four charters that asked for a feedback loop. Recorded on the scorecard
#: so a future reader cannot re-charter a fifth one by accident: if you are
#: about to build a loop, it is one of these and it already exists.
CONSUMERS: tuple[str, ...] = (
    "d05_wire_loop",            # D05 §7 — press/wire lane learning
    "is_w5_ranker",             # IS-W5 — ranker retrain + template-pool tuning
    "persona_w4_report_card",   # Persona W4 — per-account report card
    "media_w2_scorecard",       # Media W2 — property scorecards
)

#: The scorecard's JOINT cell key. Charter/IS-W5 wording: "hook family x format
#: x register x account".
DIMS: tuple[str, ...] = ("account", "format", "register", "hook_family")

#: E6 LEARNING SPINE (masterplan §10 E6) — the DECISION provenance a post
#: carries: the mixer's shape, the allocator's angle, and (for intraday items)
#: the detector trigger that fired. ``outbox.py`` already stamps the first two
#: onto ``item["source"]`` for exactly this purpose ("so the learning lane can
#: join engagement back onto the decisions that produced the post") and
#: ``hot_tape.packet_to_source`` stamps the third.
#:
#: THESE ARE MARGINAL TABLES, NOT EXTRA JOINT-KEY DIMENSIONS, and that is a
#: deliberate call. Folding them into ``DIMS`` would multiply the cell space by
#: |shape| x |angle| x |trigger| ~= 5 x 8 x 9 = ~360. At real volume (~59
#: posts/day, a 7-day window => ~410 labelled rows) every joint cell would hold
#: about one row against an n-floor of 20, so every cell would read "seeding"
#: and E6's stated purpose — "quota/weight moves happen as CONFIG EDITS citing
#: the table" — would have no citable row in it. One dimension at a time keeps
#: each bucket at ~80 rows, which is a number an operator can act on.
#:
#: If the joint key is ever wanted anyway it is one line: ``DIMS = DIMS +
#: PROVENANCE_DIMS``. The rows already carry the fields.
PROVENANCE_DIMS: tuple[str, ...] = ("shape", "angle", "trigger")
