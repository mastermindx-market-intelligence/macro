"""Deterministic Chronicle earnings-call derivative for the X outbox.

RUNTIME WIRING (2026-09-18). The scheduled
``.github/workflows/marketing-earnings-wire.yml`` checkout now invokes
``scripts/marketing_earnings_call_projection.py``, which calls :func:`run_ledger`
over the committed Chronicle ledger and writes only through the canonical tracked
Marketing outbox. This wires the derivative into the review queue; it does **not**
arm public sending. ``marketing-publish.yml``, operator approval, the publisher's
kill switch, cadence, and Buffer channel ownership remain separate gates.

The wiring deliberately loads the operator-owned ``config/marketing.yml`` earnings
route and fails closed if that route is missing, includes ``data/chronicle`` in
the workflow sparse checkout, and carries the existing R2 card-host credentials.
The bounded age/event caps below remain the flood guard on first and subsequent
runs. A green unit test is still not production proof: the scheduled/workflow
consumer and its outbox receipt are the runtime evidence.

This is a projection, not another research engine.  Its only input is the
committed :mod:`engine.chronicle.earnings_calls` ``earnings.call_event.v1``
ledger.  The qualitative model has already done its work upstream; this module
only selects cited facts, applies the existing marketing gates, renders the
existing card family, and enters the canonical outbox.

Public contract:

``compose_event``
    Pure, deterministic native-post copy.  It never calls a model and always
    labels the output as research context rather than trading advice.

``build_outbox_item``
    Builds ``marketing.outbox/v1`` through ``outbox.make_item`` and stamps the
    existing Gift-Grip-Proof verdict.  Provenance carries the committed event
    id, transcript revision hash, source URL, and source-record id.

``enqueue_event``
    Reuses wire routing, the cross-account story lock, copy validation,
    preflight/durable outbox dedupe, card publishing, and the value gate.  A
    rerun of the same event revision is refused *before* rendering.  A newer
    revision of an already-emitted company-period is returned as an explicit
    ``correction_required`` receipt; it is never appended as an unlabeled
    second post.

``run_ledger``
    Reads only the committed ledger.  By default it admits calls from the last
    two calendar days and at most eight rows, preventing a first deployment
    from turning a historical transcript backfill into an X flood.

The one-owner identity is exactly
``earnings-call:<ticker>:<quarter>:<year>``.  X/Buffer has no self-reply
threading seam today, so the native post stays link-free and the transcript
citation plus optional article URL remain in provenance for a future reply
actuator.  We do not pretend a reply was scheduled when the publisher cannot
send one.
