"""engine.marketing.expression_dial — the expression dial + codex quirk pass (XG-W1).

The operator's subtlety law, encoded. Intelligence Suite masterplan §5 pins it:
"Personality is seasoning, never the meal; 'cannot be too cute or overboard' is a
validator, not a vibe." This module IS that validator.

WHAT THIS MODULE OWNS
---------------------
1. **The dial map** — per-kind personality intensity, one source of truth
   (:data:`PROFILES`). ``wire/news = 0`` (house wire voice, zero personality),
   ``analysis (signal/macro/education) = 1``, ``chart/watchlist/receipt = 2``.
   Charter §2 amendment 3 adds ``reply``: 2 for employees, 1 for the flagship.
   Never above :data:`DIAL_CEILING`.

2. **The house quirk lexicon** (:data:`MARKERS`) — the machine-readable encoding
   of the PINNED codex quirk prose. Every marker cites the codex line it encodes.
   A spec declares marker ids with an ``enabled`` flag; anything else that fires
   is an unwhitelisted quirk and a violation. The LLM never gets to widen the
   whitelist: the pass is deterministic post-processing plus validation, run
   AFTER generation.

3. **Dark canon** — a declared-but-``enabled: false`` marker is BANNED, not
   merely un-granted. The autobiographical canon (masterplan §5 + constitution
   §5.2: matcha, museums, running, tea) describes REAL employees and nothing in
   this repo verifies any of it is true of the actual people. Unverified personal
   texture on a real name is the AM-R1 class, so every canon slot ships dark and
   a hit is rejected exactly like a banned token until an employee confirms it.

4. **The AM-R1 text detectors** (:data:`AM_R1_DETECTORS`) — the three pinned
   fabricated-claim lines were prose-only until now: ``personas.py`` required
   every spec to LIST them, and nothing ever read a post looking for one. On real
   named humans (four employees + the founder) that gap is the whole risk, so the
   prose lines finally get regexes, keyed by the exact strings in
   ``personas.AM_R1_BANNED_PATTERNS`` so the two cannot drift.

ONE HOUSE VOCAB GUARD, TWO CALLERS
----------------------------------
Hype vocabulary, study names and the "validated" word law live in
``copywriter.banned_language()`` and are NOT forked here — this module CALLS it
(lazily) so a phrase added upstream is inherited the same night. ``validate_copy``
already runs that guard on the same text, so it passes ``include_house_bans=False``
to avoid reporting each hit twice; every other caller gets the house bans for
free. Only the PER-PERSONA ``voice_codex.banned`` list is this module's own.

THREE MARKER CLASSES (why the count is not a flat tally)
--------------------------------------------------------
The four pinned dial-1 examples in masterplan §5 are the calibration set — they
MUST pass verbatim, and a flat "one marker per post" tally fails Cici's, which
carries both a session handoff and a glossed Chinese phrase. So markers carry a
class, and the dial spends its budget in a fixed order:

  * ``frame``     — structural opener / framing device (an "okay so" opener, a
                    numbered micro-list, "While New York slept"). Budget: ≤1 at
                    dial ≥1, 0 at dial 0. This is the "vocabulary tilt" §5 grants
                    at dial 1.
  * ``flourish``  — playful, emotive or lifestyle texture (an exclamation, a
                    parenthetical aside, a signature emoji). Budget: ≤1 at dial 2,
                    0 below. This is §5's "one playful line allowed".
  * ``precision`` — a Chinese phrase carrying its instant English gloss. NOT
                    charged to the dial: it is Cici's beat SUBSTANCE, not
                    seasoning, and it is governed by its own hard law instead
                    (untranslated zh in an EN post is her pinned ban and is a
                    violation at every dial, including 0).

Total whitelisted hits therefore never exceed the dial, which is exactly the
"per-post quirk-count ≤ dial level" rule; the classes only decide which kind of
quirk the budget buys first.

FREQUENCY CAPS — SIGNATURE QUIRKS ARE EXEMPT FROM ANTI-SAMENESS ONLY UP TO A CAP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A signature opener repeated daily stops being a signature and becomes the LLM
tell the constitution's anti-sameness discipline exists to kill. So each declared
marker may carry ``max_per_post``, ``max_per_day`` and ``max_share_7d``, and an
over-cap hit is rejected exactly like a banned token.

``max_per_post`` needs nothing but the post and is enforced always. ``max_per_day``
and ``max_share_7d`` need history, which the caller supplies as *recent* — a list
of ``{"text": str, "date": "YYYY-MM-DD"}``. When no history is passed those caps
are simply not evaluated (stated, not silently skipped); the durable store that
will always supply it is XG-W3's ``data/marketing/personas/<id>/phrases.jsonl``.
The share cap always grants at least one use — ``allowance = max(1, floor(cap *
window_size))`` — so a quiet week can never make the first use of a signature
illegal.

IMPORT CLOSURE (this module runs in the thin ``marketing-engine`` CI lane —
``pytest pyyaml``, no pandas)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * module level: stdlib (``re``, ``math``, ``datetime``, ``pathlib``, ``typing``)
    + ``engine.marketing.personas`` (itself stdlib + yaml).  Nothing else, ever.
  * ``personas`` imports this module LAZILY, inside its codex validator only, so
    the dependency runs one way at import time and there is no cycle.
  * ``copywriter`` imports this module LAZILY, inside its call sites, and this
    module imports ``copywriter`` LAZILY inside :func:`violations` — neither
    module's import-time closure grows.

#:
#: ``wire``, ``breaking`` and ``earnings`` joined ``outbox.KINDS`` in XG-W2 (the
