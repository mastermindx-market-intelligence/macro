"""engine.marketing.wire_routing — which account owns a wire emission (XG-W2).

THE GAP THIS CLOSES. ``engine/marketing/press_lane.py`` hardcoded
``_ACCOUNT = "flagship"`` at module scope, so the entire press/wire lane could
address exactly one of the seven live Buffer channels. That was invisible in
config: an operator reading ``publish.channels`` saw seven addressable accounts
and no hint that the wire lane could only ever speak as one of them. Worse, the
account whose whole job IS the wire — ``mastermind_news`` — could not receive a
wire item even after being enabled, because the routing lived in a Python
constant.

Routing is now CONFIG (``config/marketing.yml`` ``wire_routing:``):

    wire_routing:
      default: flagship
      classes:
        macro_print: flagship
        policy: flagship
        ...

A routing change is a config edit, never a code edit. The mapping keys are
``breaking_relevance`` event_class slugs (the same slugs ``press_lane``'s
``_CLASS_LABELS`` table renders).

LIVENESS IS NOT ROUTING. The map may name an account that is not armed yet —
``mastermind_news`` is wired-but-dark on purpose. Routing therefore resolves
through the accounts model (``engine.marketing.accounts.effective_accounts``):
a class routed to a disabled account falls back to the default with a
start-of-line ``::warning``, so the operator sees the intent AND the fact that
it is not in force. Enabling the desk is what arms the route — exactly one flip,
in ``desk_network``, where every other arming decision already lives.

SPILL IS ROUTING TOO (W4d). When the account a class routes to has spent its
daily wire budget, the surplus may move to ANOTHER wire desk rather than being
dropped — but only to a desk the operator has already declared a wire owner.
``spill_pool`` answers that question from the SAME config and the SAME liveness
read as ``route``, so there is exactly one answer to "may this desk carry a wire
relay". It deliberately does NOT return every enabled account in
``desk_network``: the persona desks (meagan/sophia/kelly/cici/founder) are
authored voices, and the charter is explicit that wire accounts RELAY and never
take a stance (masterplan §4 safety rails). Handing a persona a raw press relay
would be a voice violation dressed up as a volume fix.

A DARK DESK PARKS, IT DOES NOT DONATE ITS VOLUME (W5, 2026-08-03). The
fallback described above — "a class routed to a disabled account falls back to
the default" — was written for a lane that emitted a handful of items a day. It
is the wrong shape for a FIREHOSE: the wire desk's whole traffic silently became
the brand account's traffic the moment an operator flipped one switch, and the
operator saw the result as four posts from one Fed appearance inside an hour on
@mastermindx001. Redirecting is now OPT-IN (``wire_routing.dark_desk.policy``,
default ``park``); the default is that the item stays addressed to the desk that
OWNS it, is COUNTED in :func:`park_census`, is announced once per desk with a
start-of-line ``::warning``, and parks at dispatch (the publisher quarantines an
item addressed to a desk that is not enabled, reason ``account_disabled``) —
where the admin can see it. A brand desk never inherits a dark desk's volume by
default. The narrow escape hatch is ``dark_desk.severity_exception``, OFF by
default and bounded by an explicit severity floor: one genuinely huge single
event may still be mirrored onto a live desk. Volume never may.

VOLUME IS ITS OWN BOUND, INDEPENDENT OF ROUTING (W5). Routing answers "whose
item is this"; it cannot answer "how many of these may one desk take". Those are
different questions and the lane had only the first, plus a press-lane-local
daily counter that lives in daemon state — so a lost or reset cursors.json, and
every OTHER lane that emits ``kind="breaking"`` (hot_tape, fastlane, the
earnings call lane), were entirely outside it. Measured on the committed outbox
for 2026-08-03: **11** ``kind="breaking"`` items on ``flagship`` in one day,
every one of them ``event_class=macro_print`` — i.e. correctly routed, never
redirected, and still a print ticker on the brand account. ``wire_volume.breaking``
is the bound that closes that: a rolling-window ceiling on how many breaking
items one ACCOUNT may take, read from the outbox itself (the record of what the
network actually produced) rather than from any one lane's private counter. It
binds here, in the routing seam every wire lane already goes through, so surplus
moves to a declared wire desk with headroom instead of piling on the brand.

        (absent) -> {wire_routing.default} | set(wire_routing.classes.values())

    The implicit form is the useful default — an account an operator has already
    pointed a wire class at is, by that act, a declared wire owner. The explicit
    key exists so a desk can be made spill-eligible WITHOUT owning a class
    outright (the wire desk that takes overflow but is not the primary for
    anything).

    WHY NOT "every enabled account". Because ``desk_network`` also holds the
    persona desks, and §4's safety rails say wire accounts never take stances.
    A press relay routed to a persona is a voice violation, and it would arrive
    through the one lane whose whole contract is verbatim-with-attribution.
    Volume is not a reason to break the charter, so the pool stays declarative.

    LIVENESS IS THE SAME READ ``route`` USES. Unknown liveness (the accounts
    model could not be consulted) returns ONLY the default — the pre-W4d
    behaviour, and the same fail-closed answer ``route`` gives — because an
    import failure is not evidence that a desk is armed. A dark account is never
    in the returned list.

    The default account always sorts FIRST when it is live (it is the historical
    owner of every class); the rest follow in sorted order so a spill choice is
    reproducible across runs rather than dict-order roulette.

    A DESK AT ITS BREAKING CEILING IS NOT A SPILL TARGET (W5). This function
    answers "may this desk carry a wire relay", and a desk that has already
    taken its window's worth may not — so the ceiling is enforced HERE, at the
    one place the whole lane asks that question, rather than being bolted onto
    each caller. Without it the ceiling would be trivially routable around:
    press_lane's overflow picks the desk with the most headroom from this list,
    so leaving a capped flagship in it would let surplus land on exactly the
    brand desk the cap was fitted to protect. Pass ``root`` — the ceiling reads

      3. :func:`breaking_cap_verdict` applies the rolling per-account ceiling.
         Surplus moves to a DECLARED wire desk that still has headroom
         (``spill_pool``, already ceiling-aware, so a persona desk can never be
         picked and a capped desk is never in the list).

    When the owner is capped and NO wire desk has headroom, the verdict is
    ``parked`` with reason ``breaking_cap_exhausted``. A caller that can refuse
    should refuse; :func:`route`, whose string contract predates this and has
    live callers, degrades to returning the owner and lets the caller's own
    budget/census report it — a ceiling may throttle a desk, it may not silently
    delete an item behind an API that cannot say so.

        caller that never measured, is not evidence of a major event, and the
        expensive direction of this gate is the permissive one.

    LIVENESS DROPS AN ADDITIVE SEAT, IT NEVER REDIRECTS IT. Seats 1..n read the
    same ``_enabled_accounts`` roster :func:`route` does, but a dark desk here is
    simply not written — it does not park (a seat that never existed is not an
    item being held, and counting it in ``park_census`` would inflate that census
    with posts nobody wrote) and it does not hand its angle to another desk (the
    angle belongs to the voice, not to the slot). The three-answer contract from
    :func:`resolve_desk` holds: None (accounts model unavailable) and the empty
    set (no ``desk_network`` roster) are UNKNOWN, not proof of darkness, so both
    leave the configured seats intact.

    THE RELAY CEILING DOES NOT BIND AN ADDITIVE SEAT, and this is the one place
    a reader will think the code is wrong, so it is stated plainly. Config sets
    ``wire_volume.breaking.accounts.founder: 0`` — and 0 for meagan, sophia,
    kelly and cici — as a belt: if some future lane ever addresses a persona
    directly with a RELAY, its ceiling is zero rather than the network default.
    That belt is correct and stays. It does not apply here because it answers a
    different question. ``breaking_cap_verdict`` bounds how many RELAYS a desk
    may take; a fan-out seat is an authored angle on a public fact, which is the
    thing charter §4 permits a persona precisely because it is not a relay. The
    bound on seats is ``wire_routing.fanout.max_accounts`` (3), not that counter.

    So if you are reading this because you found a ``founder`` breaking item next
    to a ``founder: 0`` row: the row still bans founder from relays and from
    :func:`spill_pool`, and :func:`route` still never returns founder for any
    class. Fan-out is deliberately outside that counter. The triple is pinned in
    tests/test_marketing_wire_fanout.py so this cannot rot into a hole.

    SEAT 0 IS THE EXCEPTION, because seat 0 IS the relay. It comes from
    :func:`route`, cap check and all, so a capped owner still spills to a desk
    with headroom exactly as it does today — this function changes nothing about
    the item that would have been emitted anyway.

    Never raises.
