"""engine.marketing.content_studio — Deterministic mixed-content plan generator.

Produces the per-account content queue and featured chart selection for
data/marketing/content_plan.json.

Public API:
    CONTENT_TYPES          — ordered list of {id, name, desc, color}
    plan_account(account, plans, *, n_days, per_day, seed) -> list[ContentItem]
    distinctness(items)    -> {max_similarity, flags, note}
    content_plan(cfg, plans, *, closes_loader) -> dict  (frozen §2.3 shape)
    content_mix(items)     -> dict  {type_id: count}
    strip_scaffolding(plan) -> dict  (copy, minus in-process "_" keys)
    ARTIFACT_KEEP_KEYS     — the "_" keys allowed to reach the artifact

Selection layer (W1, LLM-first masterplan §5 — all pure, all deterministic):
    ticker_exposure(root, *, as_of)        -> {ticker: last exposure day}
    cooled_tickers(exposure, *, as_of, kind, cfg) -> frozenset[str]
    cooldown_override_reason(ticker, ...)  -> str | None  (new fact class)
    apply_reuse_budget(account_rows, *, cfg) -> counters (mutates queues)
    drop_degenerate_facts(facts, *, band)  -> (facts, n_dropped)
    shape_plan / assign_shapes             -> the corpus-grounded shape mixer
    record_shape_ledger(root, ...)         -> 14-day ledger (NIGHTLY ONLY)
    llm_required(cfg)                      -> the no-fallback law's switch

Spec constraints (§2.1 / §2.2 / §5):
  - Deterministic: NO RNG; stable per run; differs per account via account-hash.
  - Public copy carries NO technical-indicator vocabulary.
  - All 7 content types appear in every account's queue (≥1 each where slots allow).
  - signal is the largest type weight for all accounts.
  - Featured charts ≤12, only for plans with closes available.

#
# EDUCATION IS OFF AT 0.00 (operator 2026-07-30). The kind contradicts its own
# copy law and cannot be written out of it:
#   * the law says "education posts show YOUR OWN working on something real from
#     today, never a definition, a lesson, or a rule for the reader";
#   * education items are built with NO market facts on purpose (see the
#     fact-cache branch below: "education posts: no market facts (conceptual,
#     not data-driven)").
# A post with no fact from today can only BE a definition. So the whole bank
# reads as a lecture, and a guard sweep of the 252 deterministic templates found
# 9 of the 10 lecture-register violations sitting in this one family ("Plain
# English: what's a 'setup'?", "The part most people skip"). The operator, on the
# 44 that shipped: "past education posts have all been terrible and useless" and
# "so far none of the education ones are good".
# The weight moves to CHART (0.13 -> 0.23), not into filler and not spread
# thinly across everything: a chart post is anchored to a real fact AND ships an
# illustration, which is the half of the plan the operator wants more of. Tilts
# are validated to sum to 1.0 (personas.PersonaSpecError), so the weight has to
# land somewhere explicit rather than being dropped.
# Re-enable education only when its items are anchored to a real same-day fact
# and LLM-written; the deterministic bank cannot get there.

# VOICE DOCTRINE v5 (docs/marketing_voice_doctrine_v5.md, adjudicated 2026-08-11).
# THE READ IS IN THE SELECTION, NOT IN A PERFORMED REACTION: the subject of every
# sentence is the MARKET, never the author. This bank is the deterministic floor
# and the LLM copywriter overwrites it on any normal night, which is exactly why
# it has to carry the v5 register too. A scaffold left in the v4 voice is a
# REINFECTION SOURCE: it ships whenever the model lane drops, and it is the
# nearest in-repo example for whoever writes the next bank.
#
# Banned in this bank, permanently: first person (I, I'm, my, me, we, our, us),
# question marks, exclamation marks, advice imperatives (watch, keep an eye on,
# don't chase), compliance caveats ("Historical, not a promise", "Size it
# sensibly"), engagement bait, closer cheese ("Watching, no position", "Levels,
# not advice"), meta-language about the post or the number, and em/en dashes.
# Invalidation is stated as a fact about the LEVEL ("Below 209 the trigger is
# gone"), never as a fact about the author's trust ("I trust it only above 209").
# Plan copy also stays FACT-NEUTRAL: only the fact layer may describe the tape.
# tests/test_marketing_voice_v5.py is the census-by-content ratchet over this

# WHAT THIS FIXES. A directly-tilted `watchlist` slot used to start with
# `ticker=""` and stay that way: `plan_account` pulls a ticker only for
# ("signal", "chart", "receipt"), so the organic 6% watchlist allocation
# produced market-commentary posts and the only ticker-bearing "On Our Radar"
# posts were DEMOTED SIGNALS — 168 of 335 on one measured plan. The lane that
# is supposed to say "here is a name we are watching" had no way to name one.
#
# The pools that answer that question have existed since PR-B and had no
# consumer. The priority order below is the masterplan's, and it is an order of
# EDITORIAL CLAIM, not of data quality: a name with a live story earns the slot
# over a name that is merely liquid, and the long-tail quota sits last because
# it is a floor on variety, not a source of relevance.

    bare `graded_receipts: 0` that reads as "nothing resolved" — an honest quiet
    week. It was not. Six plans on the live board HAD resolved (three hit a
    profit level, three invalidated); they were 21 to 22 days old against a
    14-day window. The supply existed and the gate was cutting it off.

    Those two states look identical in the artifact and need opposite responses:
    nothing to say is fine and self-correcting; a window shorter than the horizon
    it grades is a permanent famine. So when there are ZERO receipts but resolved
    plans exist just outside the window, this names the oldest one and the number

    receipts graded, and 0 receipt items in 570 rows, because a receipt slot could
    not draw a resolved plan's ticker (see `receipt_pool` in plan_account). The
    monitor built to catch receipt starvation was the one thing guaranteeing
    nobody saw it: a graded receipt made it return before it looked at whether a
    single receipt POST existed.

    So `receipt_items` — how many receipt-typed items survived onto the emitted
    day — is now part of the verdict. Graded > 0 and items == 0 is its own alarm
    with its own wording, because the fix is a different fix: not a window, a
    supply seam. `None` means the caller did not measure it, and then only the

        summary.charts      : 102
        content.copy.dropped: {"provider": 914, "validate": 1}

    915 posts were planned, 914 died because the LLM provider never answered,
    the desks had nothing to publish, and 102 headless-Chrome cards were
    rastered for them anyway — charts are drawn BEFORE the writer runs, so the
    render budget is spent whether or not any copy survives.

    WHAT DID AND DID NOT EXIST. The copywriter's own per-desk warning DID fire —
    six times, once per enabled account ("The planned-copy lane dropped 166 of
    166 posts (100%...)"). What was missing is the whole-plan fact. Six warnings
    scattered through a 24,000-line nightly log, each true about one desk, never
    add up to "there is nothing to publish tomorrow" in the reader's head, and
    the run still concluded green. `_copy_dropped` held the total the entire time
    at content.copy.dropped and nothing looked at it.

    So this is an AGGREGATE and an ESCALATION, not the first alarm: it fires once,
    at ::error, only when the plan as a whole came out empty. The publisher has
    had the same shape on its side for a while (`::error
    title=marketing-zero-posted`); the plan side, where the supply is created,
    had per-part warnings and no whole.

    It also names the remedy. The per-desk line says "a provider-stage spike is a
    credential or quota problem", which still leaves the reader to map that onto
    an env var — and on 2026-07-31 it was misleading besides: credentials were
    fine and DeepSeek was answering, it just answered with no text because its
    thinking consumed max_tokens (see llm_auth._deepseek_no_thinking). Naming the
    variables costs nothing when the guess is right and is quickly falsified when
    it is wrong, which is the better failure of the two.

    AND IT NOW CARRIES THE OUTAGE BREAKER. The same fault ran on 07-30 and again
    on 07-31 shape-for-shape, because a plan that came out empty is only ONE of
    the ways a provider fault shows up — and the loudest one. A night where the
    provider eats 60% of the plan still ships 40% of it, still reports
    total_posts > 0, and used to say so at ::warning. The breaker below keys on
    the PROVIDER share alone, escalates to ::error, and names the rung — see

    candles, no indicators, no footer CTA. It exists so a Chrome-less host (CI,
    the ubuntu publish runner) still posts a picture instead of bare text.

    WHAT PRODUCTION ACTUALLY DOES, measured rather than inferred: the renderers
    are distinguishable by size — legacy is 1200x675, the real card rasters at
    2000x1760. All 21 PNGs the nightly wrote on 2026-07-29
    (data/marketing/outbox/media/2026-07-29/) are 2000x1760. Production ships the
    real card, and this census should read 0% on a healthy night.

    IT WAS STILL WORTH BUILDING, and the reason is the point. A committed
    content_plan.json showed 15 of 23 cards as `legacy_png`, and that one number
    was read three different ways: an audit called it "65% of our images are the
    retired legacy chart"; a refutation counted SVGs on disk, found every one v2,
    and dismissed it (the legacy path emits a PNG — that check cannot observe
    what it was used to rule out); then the 65% was believed as a live production
    failure. All three were reading an artifact a LOCAL run had overwritten,
    where Chrome was contended by parallel work — `git log` on the file names the
    author. Nobody could tell which environment produced it, because the only
    trace of a fallback was a `log.warning` GitHub drops for not starting the
    line, and nothing counted the share.

    So this exists to end the guessing rather than to report a known fire. It
    reads `media_render` — the field that actually records which renderer drew
    the image — and puts the share where the run that produced it is identified.
    A contended local run SHOULD light it up: that is correct behaviour, because

    doesn't matter if it's 1 day old").

    The planner books a SEVEN-DAY forward queue, and ~150 cleared posts per plan
    made a decaying market claim scheduled D2-D7. By the time one of those posts
    reached its slot the tape had moved, so the publisher's live-tape gate
    refused it — correctly — and logged `tape_skipped`. That counter fired on
    every sweep of 2026-07-29 and was the reason ZERO posts went out that day.

    The tape gate was never the bug. Pre-writing perishable copy a week ahead
    was. This removes the supply the gate was going to reject anyway, which also
    stops us spending two model calls apiece writing it.

    THE ARES ×5 FIX (masterplan §1, §5.2). The planner splices one plan into
    every desk's queue, so a single fact reached five accounts with the same
    entry and target — the network-linkage fingerprint the Sentinel's
    cross-account near-dup bar exists to deny, arriving by a route that bar
    cannot see (five DIFFERENT wordings of one fact).

    Rules: ≤ `max_accounts_per_ticker_day` accounts per (ticker, day), and
    exactly `max_signal_accounts_per_day` account for signal kinds (a directional
    call with entry/stop numbers is one desk's call or it is a coordinated one).
    Survivors get DISJOINT angles. Losers are removed from the queue — never
    re-typed into filler, because supply-honest volume means an empty rung stays
    empty (§5.5).

    SCOPED TO THE EMITTED DAY. Only `day_prefix` slots ever reach the outbox
    (outbox.emit_from_content_plan defaults to D1 and the governor takes the
    default), so budgeting D2-D7 would delete posts nothing was ever going to
    send while shrinking the plan the admin reviews. Deterministic account order
    = the plan's own account order; no RNG.

    THE FILLER BUDGET rides along here (2026-07-29) for the same reason: the
    no-ticker kinds (macro/event/education) are the ONE class this function used
    to wave through unbudgeted, and the publisher now caps them per desk per day.
    Capping only the publish-time half would have quarantined 5 of flagship's 6
    planned filler posts every night — planned, written by the LLM, charted, then
    killed at the last gate. Trimming here instead means the plan the admin
    reviews is the plan that can post, and an item the budget deletes never costs
    a model call.

# Ladder SHAPE — how many forward days, and how many rungs on each (W4a)

#: Forward ladder days the planner books. ONE, because nothing reads a previous
#: plan: `content_plan` rebuilds the whole ladder every night from
#: `plan_account`, and `outbox.emit_from_content_plan` takes only `D1-` slots
#: (outbox.py:2199 — its own comment says D2..D7 "are supposed to be skipped").
#: The 7-day ladder therefore threw away 6/7 of everything it produced BY
#: CONSTRUCTION, and it did not throw it away evenly: the cross-day cooldown
#: pool below is applied to the EMITTED day only, so an empty cooled pool
#: dropped a D1 rung while the never-published days kept filling from the
#: uncooled pool. Measured 2026-08-02: 1,176 items planned, 168 on D1.
#: (masterplan §8.1 V1 / §8.2 W4a)
_DEFAULT_FORWARD_DAYS = 1

#: `per_day` is sized to the account's own ramp cap times this factor, not to a
#: flat 28. The headroom exists because the gates BELOW the allocator (fact-reuse
#: budget, filler budget, the writer) reject some of what is planned — measured
#: 2026-08-02, ~65% of planned D1 rungs survive the reuse budget — so a desk
#: capped at 10 posts/day needs ~20 rungs offered to fill its day. Above 2.0 the
#: extra rungs are mostly eaten by the reuse budget rather than reaching a post
#: (measured: headroom 2.0 → 128 items planned / 81 D1 survivors; 2.8 → 168 /
#: 89), which is the "generating 28 to publish 10" waste in miniature.
_DEFAULT_PER_DAY_HEADROOM = 2.0

#: STRUCTURAL floor on the rung count, independent of any cap: the allocator
#: cannot express a nine-kind tilt in fewer than nine rungs, and below it whole
#: content families leave the plan silently (`_largest_remainder`'s ≥1
#: guarantee needs one rung per positive-weight kind).
#:
#: It exists because the in-code sentinel default is 2/day — a LAUNCH FLOOR, not
#: a working cadence — so any caller without a `sentinel:` block (a test, an
#: admin preview, a fixture config) would otherwise be handed a 4-rung plan
#: carrying four of the nine kinds. Against the shipped config this floor never
#: binds: every desk's `cap × headroom` is 28 or 60, both far above nine.

    bound first. With ~65% survival through the gates below the allocator that

    publish-time movers lane is [flagship, founder]-only and the wire lane zeroes
    them) at ~18 posts/day against a 20/day operator floor. The 15-min ladder

    behaviour and never silently shrinks a desk's day.

    NOTE ON SPACING. Trimming ``per_day`` packs the EARLIEST rungs (see
    `_slot_labels`), and that costs no coverage: the Sentinel's
    `cadence_cap_daily` scan is first-come-first-kept in queue order, so the

#:     was a theme_list on a `weeks_1_2` tier — spent on a banned format.
#:   * `links_allowed` → gates a LINK, not a kind. `links.attach_links` writes
#:     `item["link"]` as a FIELD, sentinel's link rule (sentinel.py:1347) reads
#:     headline+body only, and `emit_from_content_plan` never copies the field
#:     onto the outbox item (verified: 0 of the ledger's items carry `link`).
#:     No planned kind is unshippable because links are off.
#:   * `max_cashtags_per_post` → theme_list is EXEMPT from the breadth count by
#:     construction (sentinel.py:1365: the format requires ≥4 member cashtags,

                an allocation to a banned format is not a post, it is a slot the
                Sentinel will quarantine (`ramp_theme_list`) after the writer has
                been paid for it. Kelly's ONE D1 at-bat on 2026-08-02 was a
                `theme_list` on a `weeks_1_2` tier — the account has never posted
                once, ever, and the planner spent her only rung on a format she
                is banned from using (masterplan §8.1 V2). The weight is
                RENORMALISED into the kinds she may ship, so the ban costs the
                desk no volume — it moves the at-bat, it does not delete it.
    cooled_watch / cooled_signal: tickers inside the cross-day cooldown (see
                `cooled_tickers`) for coverage kinds and for signal kinds
                respectively — the LKFN/GPI/CBOE fix (masterplan §5.1). A slot
                whose type needs a ticker and finds NO eligible plan is DROPPED,
                not filled: supply-honest volume means an empty rung stays empty
                (§5.5), and a ticker-less "signal" post renders empty tokens.
                THE EMPTY POOL NEVER FALLS BACK to the uncooled pool: doing so
                would publish exactly the repetition the cooldown exists to stop.
    emit_day_prefix: the ONLY day the cooldown is applied to. Only `D1` slots are
                ever emitted (outbox.emit_from_content_plan defaults to D1 and the
                governor takes the default), so cooling a forward day would delete
                posts nothing was going to send. At the default `n_days=1` EVERY
                slot is an emit slot, so the cooldown applies uniformly and the
                asymmetry that used to decimate D1 alone cannot arise.
    report:     optional mutable counter sink so the plan report can print the
                funnel without this function changing its return type. Keys:
                `dropped_cooldown` (+ `dropped_cooldown_by_account`),
                `slots_offered`, `ramp_banned_kinds`. content_plan persists all
                of them into the artifact — a drop counter that dies in a local
                dict is the defect class that hid 12 nights of lost posts.
    ticker_supply: ordered attention-pool rows (`attention_supply`) used to fill
                `watchlist`/`chart` slots that the Prophet pool cannot. This is
                the TrendSpider PR-C selection fix: a directly-tilted watchlist
                slot used to start with `ticker=""` and stay that way, so the
                "On Our Radar" lane could only ever carry demoted signals.
                Absent/empty → the historic behaviour, exactly.
    chart_post_counts: mutable {TICKER: count} SHARED ACROSS ACCOUNTS by the
                caller, so `max_chart_posts_per_ticker` (§0 gate 6, default 3)
                is a per-DAY cap on the network rather than a per-desk one. A
                per-desk cap would let six desks post the same name nine times
                between them and each of them be "within budget", which is the
                hobby-horse failure the cap exists to stop.
    max_chart_posts_per_ticker: that cap. Config surface is
                `supply.per_ticker_day.max_chart_posts`.

    # a graded outcome must ship one. `_largest_remainder`'s >=1 guarantee
    # already delivers this for every shipped desk today (measured 2026-08-11:
    # 1-7 receipt rungs per desk across per_day 9/28/55), and this floor is
    # deliberately a NO-OP against that config. It exists because the guarantee
    # has a blind spot the config could wander into: the guarantee is SKIPPED
    # outright when `len(positive) > total_slots` (see _largest_remainder), and
    # rounding alone decides the rest, so a retuned tilt or a short ladder can
    # silently drop receipts to zero on a night when a real outcome was sitting
    # in the pool. A floor is the right shape here where a tilt bump is not:
    # tilt is a MIX preference and would inflate receipts on empty nights too,
    # whereas this binds only when there is something to show.
    #
    # TWO GATES, both required:
    #   * pool non-empty — with nothing resolved, the rung would draw coverage
    #     and be reallocated to `watchlist` downstream, so forcing one buys a
    #     watchlist post mislabelled as a floor;
    #   * receipt still carries positive weight — a kind this desk's tilt or ramp
    #     tier zeroed must never be resurrected here
    #     (tests/test_marketing_ladder_collapse.py::
    #      test_a_zero_weight_kind_is_never_resurrected).

    # the whole difference between the two. `_largest_remainder` is spreading NINE
    # kinds and must not rob one to pay another, so it requires `> 1` and gives up
    # when no kind has a spare. This floor is making a PRIORITY statement on a
    # ladder too short to hold every family: when a graded outcome exists, the
    # track record outranks the marginal kind. On a short ladder several kinds are
    # already at zero, so the trade is receipt-for-one-other, not receipt-for-
    # nothing. At per_day >= _MIN_LADDER_RUNGS this never fires (measured: every

    # 570-row history, and nothing in the stack was broken: the kind is in
    # outbox.KINDS, in PLANNED_KINDS, in _ANGLE_BY_KIND, in the approval-desk
    # decider list, and carries a non-zero tilt weight on all thirteen desks.
    # `graded_receipts()` returns real rows most nights (6 tickers inside the
    # 30-day window on 2026-08-08: SFM, GME, MSFT, GPI, QCOM, ARES).
    #
    # The break was here, and it was STRUCTURAL rather than intermittent. A
    # receipt slot drew its ticker from `watch_pool`, i.e. from
    # `postable_signals(plans)`, which admits ONLY `_LIVE_PHASES` —
    # triggered_pre_t1 / triggered / active / pre_trigger / running. A graded
    # receipt requires the opposite: `receipt_source._is_resolved`, i.e. phase
    # `invalidated` or a DONE profit-plan level. One plan cannot be
    # pre-resolution and resolved at the same time, so the pool a receipt slot
    # could draw from and the pool that could HAVE a receipt were disjoint by
    # construction, every night, forever. The join downstream
    # (`_receipts_by_ticker.get(ticker)`) therefore always missed and every
    # receipt item was silently reallocated to `watchlist` before the writer ran.
    #
    # `receipt_pool` is that missing pool: the resolved plans whose ticker has a
    # graded receipt, cooled by the same coverage cooldown as `watch_pool` so a
    # receipt cannot re-post a name the desk just used. Absent/empty → the slot
    # behaves exactly as it does today (drops, or reallocates to watchlist), so a
    # night with nothing resolved is unchanged.

    uploads it to the public data plane. Mutates `fc` in place, adding:

      media_url      : public https URL (when R2 creds present) else None
      media_render   : "svg_raster" (the real card) or "legacy_png" (fallback)

    THE POSTED IMAGE IS THE PREVIEWED IMAGE (2026-07-26 incident fix). The PNG is
    a raster of `fc["svg"]` — the exact artwork the Content Studio preview and
    the outbox artifact show, footer marketing bar (mastermind-x.com + "Start
    try Pro free for 7 days") included. Before this, the publish path rendered a
    SEPARATE hand-drawn PIL lookalike of the older v1 line chart, so the account
    posted a bare line chart with no URL and no CTA while the mockup promised the
    full candlestick card. Two renderers = guaranteed drift; there is now one.

    render_signal_chart_png remains ONLY as the fallback for hosts with no Chrome
    (CI, the ubuntu publish runner) so a missing rasteriser can never turn a post
    text-only. It is a degraded image, and media_render records when it was used.

    marker_index=None IS THE NO-CLAIM CONTRACT, and it must be passed by every
    caller whose SVG is markerless (the tape fallback, the filing/house-pick
    lanes). The fallback PNG is the image X actually receives when Chrome is
    missing, so a caller that renders a markerless SVG and then hands this a real
    index posts a BUY-labelled card under copy that makes no call at all. Pass
    the SAME series the SVG was drawn from, too: the SVG and this raster are two
    renderers, and feeding them different windows makes the fallback a chart of a
    different stretch of tape than the one the preview promised.

    Fully fail-soft: any render/write/upload error leaves `fc` SVG-only (no
    media_* keys) and never raises — the post degrades to text-or-SVG. No-op

    The companion to ``content_plan(..., defer_media=True)``. Call it AFTER

    plan's featured_charts in place, stamping the same media_png_path /
    media_url / media_render keys the inline path stamps, so every downstream
    reader is unchanged.

    WHY DEFER. Each PNG is one headless-Chrome launch (~13s). Rastering at plan
    time paid that for all 8 cards whether or not any post could carry them — on
    the 2026-07-28 plan every single rastered card was then quarantined by the
    cadence cap, so the whole spend shipped nothing. Charting every ticker post
    (which is the point) would have multiplied that waste by ten. Here we know
    which items passed, so we raster only what can actually post: ~2 cards per
    desk instead of every card in the plan.

    Selection: a featured chart is rastered when at least one queue item
    references its id, sits on the emit day, and is NOT quarantined. A plan whose
    gate crashed stamps sentinel_ok=False everywhere and correctly rasters
    nothing. Fully fail-soft — a card that cannot be rastered stays SVG-only and
    its post degrades to text.

    PRUNING. content_plan renders an SVG for every candidate ticker post because
    an SVG is ~1ms and capping it would mean guessing which posts survive. Those
    SVGs are ~45KB each and would bloat content_plan.json well past its current
    size, so the cards no surviving post references are dropped here — the
    artifact ends up carrying only the cards that ship. Reach-lane cards
    (theme/mover, which raster inline and carry no deferral blob) are kept
    regardless, since they are the plan's own reach content.

            # THIS RUNS BEFORE THE CARD RENDERERS BELOW, and both reasons are
            # defects it closes:
            #   1. the slot. Every item minted here used to carry MOVER-NN /
            #      THEME-NN and outbox.emit_from_content_plan drops any slot that
            #      is not "D1-…", so the desk has never published a post. Seating
            #      the item first means the ladder rung — the thing that decides
            #      whether it can ship at all — is settled before a single card
            #      is rendered for it, and an item the ladder cannot seat costs
            #      no render (same rule the filing/house-pick lane follows).
            #   2. the account. The card entries below copy `_tl_item["account"]`
            #      into featured_charts; when distribution ran AFTER them, every
            #      theme card was stamped with enabled_rows[0] while the post it
            #      belongs to had been round-robined to a different desk.

            # nightly builds this plan AFTER the close, so every market-hours
            # rung for D1 is already in the past — and a past rung means DUE NOW:

    # ── UNSEAT every card-less reach item ────────────────────────────────────
    # THE DEFECT (reproduced end-to-end 2026-07-31). Seating runs BEFORE the two
    # card renderers — deliberately, so the ladder rung is settled before a card
    # is paid for — and both renderers are fail-soft: the theme loop is wrapped in
    # `except Exception: pass`, the mover loop `continue`s on absent bars and
    # `break`s when the reach budget runs out, and neither runs at all when
    # `closes_loader` is None or the block above raised on its way here. Any of
    # those leaves the item sitting on a real D1 rung with `chart_id` still None.
    #
    # `mover` and `theme_list` are bare-cashtag kinds — they are in the
    # publisher's `_TICKER_ROLLUP_KINDS`, and `_bare_cashtag_post` refuses to ship
    # a cashtag-bearing post with no picture ("YOU WILL NOT SHIP THESE TEXT ONLY"
    # — operator, 2026-07-30). So a chartless mover is not a plainer post, it is a
    # post that is TERMINALLY QUARANTINED at dispatch. It still consumed its
    # desk's rung and its share of the day cap on the way there, and the census
    # still counted it as queued supply — a plan that reports six reach posts and
    # delivers four, with no line anywhere saying which two died or why.
    #
    # SAME LAW AS THE PUBLISH-TIME LANE, which already refuses to build an item
    # whose card would not host ("better no post than a naked ticker post" —
    # publish_time_content's module header). The plan must never EMIT a chartless
    # mover/theme either. Unseating is the plan-time form of that law: the item
    # leaves the queue, its rung goes back to the pool for a producer that can
    # actually fill it, and the drop is counted with its reason.
    #
    # RUNS OUTSIDE THE TRY on purpose. The case that most reliably produces a
    # card-less seated item is the renderer raising, which jumps straight to the
    # `except: pass` above — a pass placed inside the block would be skipped by
    # exactly the failure it exists to clean up.

    # "Carded" is CHART PRESENT IN `featured_charts`, not merely `chart_id` set.
    # The mover loop stamps `_mv_item["chart_id"]` a few statements before it
    # appends the chart dict, and `_attach_chart_media` sits between the two — so
    # a raise there leaves an id pointing at a card that was never rendered, and
    # a `chart_id is not None` test would call that item carded and ship it bare.

            TAPE, NOT SIGNAL, and the two differences below are the whole point:

            * **No marker, no highlight, no % callout.** A filing post makes no
              entry claim — "Rep. Public bought NVDA six weeks ago" and "our
              momentum screen has this name" are descriptions, not calls. The
              Prophet path draws those only for `variant == "signal"` for
              exactly this reason ("marking a 'not buying yet' post with a SETUP
              pill is the lie this split exists to prevent"), and a filing post
              has even less claim behind it than a watchlist one.
            * **No `render_signal_chart` fallback.** The v1 card hard-draws a
              green BUY label at the marker. On a congressional-disclosure post
              that is a fabricated recommendation attached to a named
              politician's trade — so a ticker with no v2 render gets NO chart,
              and the caller decides whether the post can live without one.

            RETURNS THE OHLCV WINDOW, not closes_loader's series. `_d`/`_c` are
            used only as the length gate (a name with under ten sessions is not
            worth a card); the bars the SVG is actually drawn from are `_od`/`_oc`
            and those are what the caller must stamp and what the Chrome-less
            legacy raster must redraw. Returning the other series made the marker
            date/price describe a different window than the card and gave the
            fallback PNG a different stretch of tape than the preview showed.
