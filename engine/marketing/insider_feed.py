"""engine.marketing.insider_feed — Form-4 open-market-purchase candidates (E2).

Lane 6 of the masterplan lane matrix (research/
MARKETING_CONTENT_STUDIO_LLM_FIRST_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md §10): insider buys,
daily batch, fact-locked LLM writer, OBSERVATION register, display-tier, no
calls. The editorial law is research/marketing_dockets/
CODEX_CONTENT_CASE_STUDIES_2026_07_28.md §Insider-signal post family, whose
§Signal-calculation framework is implemented here VERBATIM::

    purchase_value            = purchased_shares × weighted_average_price
    prior_shares              = post_transaction_shares − purchased_shares
    relative_stake_increase   = purchased_shares ÷ prior_shares × 100

THE DEFECT THIS LANE EXISTS TO NOT REPEAT. The codex measured five real insider
posts and found the format's central failure is that **absolute dollars mislead**:
a $6.92M purchase read as more important than a $299K one, while the filings
imply the $6.92M added ~0.85% to an already-large holding and the $299K one
multiplied its holder's stake about twelve-fold. The observed style then spent
that fact on "I'm paying attention". So the RELATIVE arithmetic is computed
first, the mechanism is classified from it, and the mechanism sentence is a
TOP-THREE fact — the only three `copywriter.build_context` shows the writer.

WHAT THE SOURCE CAN AND CANNOT TELL US. ``data/quiver/insiders.parquet`` carries
Ticker, Date (transaction), fileDate, Name, officerTitle, isDirector/isOfficer/
isTenPercentOwner, TransactionCode, AcquiredDisposedCode, Shares, PricePerShare,
SharesOwnedFollowing, directOrIndirectOwnership, ``_first_seen``. It does NOT
carry a Rule 10b5-1 indication or an original/amended flag, both of which the
codex's validation step asks for. That absence is recorded per candidate in
``risk_flags`` rather than papered over, and it is why the lane's copy never
claims a purchase was discretionary or unplanned — only that it happened, at
transaction code P, on the open market.

``engine/insider_power.py`` (0-100 conviction score) is used ONLY as display-tier
context words via :func:`power_context`; the score itself never reaches copy —
LLMs may de-escalate calibrated keys, never originate or print them.
