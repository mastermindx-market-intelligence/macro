"""engine.marketing.congress_feed — congressional-disclosure post candidates (E2).

Lane 7 of the masterplan lane matrix (research/
MARKETING_CONTENT_STUDIO_LLM_FIRST_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md §10): politician
trades, daily batch, fact-locked LLM writer, OBSERVATION register, display-tier,
no calls. The editorial law is research/marketing_dockets/
CODEX_CONTENT_CASE_STUDIES_2026_07_28.md §Insider-signal post family — adopted
in OUR register (sentence case, one cashtag, no hashtag piles, no portraits).

SOURCE. ``data/quiver/congress.parquet`` (Representative, BioGuideID,
ReportDate, TransactionDate, Ticker, Transaction, Range, House, Amount, Party,
TickerType, Description, ExcessReturn, ``_first_seen``). ``_first_seen`` is OUR
crawl stamp, which is the only column that can answer "new tonight": ReportDate
is the clerk's date and a backfill can land a three-week-old ReportDate today.

THREE THINGS THIS MODULE REFUSES TO DO
--------------------------------------
1. **It never surfaces ExcessReturn.** ``engine/congress_members.py`` documents
   why in its own header: ExcessReturn accrues from TransactionDate to Quiver's
   snapshot, so a July-2025 trade carries twelve months of compounding and a
   June-2026 trade carries two weeks. It is horizon-inconsistent BY
   CONSTRUCTION — fine as an internal ranking input, a performance claim we
   cannot stand behind once printed beside a politician's name.
   :func:`member_context` therefore returns PLAIN WORDS and
   :func:`assert_no_score` proves the phrase carries no digit.

2. **It never ranks on member skill.** Skill is display-tier context (house law:
   display-tier ships freely, authority is gauntleted). Ranking is materiality
   and side, full stop — so a well-regarded member cannot buy their way onto the
   flagship with a $1,001 dividend reinvestment.

3. **It never omits the reporting lag.** The STOCK Act allows up to 45 days, and
   the site's own writing says these are not real-time signals. Every packet
   carries the gap as a WRITER-VISIBLE fact ("traded Jun 12, disclosed today") —
   enforced by :func:`assert_lag_disclosed`, which RAISES rather than warns.

SHARED PRIMITIVES. The display/rounding/whitelist helpers below are used by BOTH
filing lanes; ``insider_feed`` imports them from here rather than keeping a
second copy, because the one thing two lanes must never disagree about is how a
number is spelled.

Public API::

    lane_cfg(cfg)                              -> dict
    load_congress(root)                        -> "pd.DataFrame | None"
    parse_range(text, fallback)                -> (low, high, mid) | None
    member_context(member)                     -> str          (plain words)
    new_disclosures(df, *, today, cfg, cooled) -> list[dict]
    congress_facts(cand)                       -> dict          (FactPacket)
    assert_lag_disclosed(packet)               -> None          (raises)
    assert_no_score(text)                      -> None          (raises)
    candidates(root, *, today, cfg, cooled, member_stats) -> list[dict]

Everything except :func:`load_congress` and :func:`candidates` is a PURE
function of its arguments — no wall clock, no RNG, no I/O — so replanning the
same night twice yields the same candidates, which is the only property that
makes the lane auditable.
