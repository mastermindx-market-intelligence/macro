"""engine/marketing/health_monitor.py — per-account health + network tripwire (XG-W6).

**This module is the M1->M2 precondition.** Charter §0 (XG-W4 gate) and §5:
"the per-account health monitor + network tripwire (XG-W6) are a hard
precondition for ANY dial flip above M1 — failures must be able to halt one
account without halting seven." That sentence is the whole design brief, and it
is why there is NO fleet-halt code path in this file. A halt is always a row
keyed by ONE account id. Even the fleet-level network tripwire expresses itself
by writing one halt row per implicated account, so "halt six but not the
seventh" is not a feature that has to be remembered — it is the only shape the
registry can hold.

**Every input is deterministic telemetry. The LLM never scores** (charter §2
amendment 9, extended to every critic including persona/readability/engagement).
Nothing here imports a model client and nothing may; ``tests/
test_marketing_learning.py`` walks this module's AST to keep that true.

The four per-account monitors:

  approval_rate        operator approvals / (approvals + rejections) on the
                       reply desk. A desk the operator keeps rejecting is not
                       producing what it thinks it is.
  rejection_reason_mix which reasons dominate. A mix tilted at a SINGLE reason
                       is a fixable defect; a flat mix is a taste gap. The two
                       need different responses, so the shape is reported, not
                       just the rate.
  engagement_trend     recent median engagement against the trailing baseline,
                       from the labels store (which reads the LIVE metrics
                       poll). A collapse is the observable half of a
                       reach penalty.
  last_nine            the profile-conversion floor's last-nine-post diagnostic
                       (charter §3 item 6): of the last nine posts a visitor
                       would see, how many carry a receipt (chart/media), how
                       many are duplicates of each other, and how many are
                       unmeasured. This is what a profile visitor actually
                       judges, so it is measured on the same window they see.

The network tripwire (fleet level, per-account effect):

  simultaneous_collapse  N+ accounts whose engagement collapsed on the SAME day.
                         One account falling is weather; six falling together is
                         the fleet-linkage signal the charter's risk register
                         names.
  cross_account_corr     rank correlation of PER-POST engagement across account
                         pairs. Independently-run desks should not move in
                         lockstep; lockstep is the shape a shared limiter
                         leaves behind. Per-POST, not summed: one nightly
                         content plan drives all seven desks, so their daily
                         post counts move together by construction and summed
                         engagement would correlate on our own scheduler.

Halt semantics: a tripped account halts THAT ACCOUNT ONLY. ``is_halted`` is
consulted by ``scripts/marketing_publisher.py`` (the post rail) and
``engine/marketing/reply_export.py`` (the reply rail). A halt is cleared only by
an operator, never by the monitor itself — a monitor that could un-halt its own
trip would silence itself the moment the underlying condition became
intermittent.
