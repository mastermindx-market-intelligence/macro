"""engine.marketing.movers_source — Heatmap-backed data source for mover/theme posts.

Reads site/marketdata/sp500_heatmap.json and site/marketdata/themes_heatmap.json
to produce structured data for `mover` and `theme_list` content types.

Public API:
    load_movers(root) -> dict | None
    prefer_fresher_session(data) -> dict
    top_movers(data, *, tf, n, min_abs) -> {gainers, losers}
    theme_lists(data, *, tf, n, min_members, min_abs_theme) -> list[dict]
    technical_state(ticker, root) -> str | None
    mover_facts(mover, data, *, root=None) -> {facts, numbers_whitelist}
    theme_facts(theme_item) -> {facts, numbers_whitelist}

All functions are deterministic and fail-soft (return None / empty on errors).
No invented numbers — every number in the whitelist comes from real heatmap data.

UNIVERSE (widened 2026-08-02, masterplan §3 PR-B.3). The S&P heatmap is 503
names, which meant every "biggest mover" this desk has ever posted was the
biggest mover *of the S&P 500* — a Russell name down 22% on the day did not
exist. ``load_movers`` now also returns ``pack_tiles``: heatmap-shaped rows
built from ``data/marketing/hot_tape_pack.json`` for the ~800 liquid names the
heatmap does not carry, and ``top_movers`` considers them alongside the index
tiles. ``min_abs`` and the ``tier_map`` T3 exclusion are unchanged and apply to
the union, so the widening adds candidates and removes no gate.

Three things bound the extension, and all three are the pack's own honesty
guards rather than new inventions:

* **1D only.** The pack carries last/prev close, which is exactly one session.
  It has no 1W/1M change, so a ``tf`` other than ``"1D"`` sees the index tiles
  alone — the same board it has always seen — instead of a silently narrower
  version of a wider claim.
* **Split suspicion.** ``data/massive_stock_day`` is not split-adjusted, so a
  name the pack flags ``suspect`` (any adjacent close-to-close move beyond
  ±60% in its dense window) contributes no percentage. This is the same refusal
  ``hot_tape_pack`` documents for its own card rendering — a split-cliff candle
  is a lie-shaped picture, and a split-cliff percentage is a lie-shaped number.
  Residual exposure, stated: a clean 2-for-1 split reads as −50% and clears the
  ±60% guard. Every one of the 813 pack-only names measured on 2026-08-02 is
  also carried by a split-adjusted store (``data/baskets/ohlcv`` or
  ``data/stocks``), so the exposure is presently zero rather than merely small.
* **Tip-current records only.** A record whose own ``last_date`` lags the pack's
  ``trade_date`` has a "1-day" move from some other week.

Rows carry ``source`` (``"sp500_heatmap"`` | ``"hot_tape_pack"``) because the
claim a fact may make depends on it: only an index tile can be called one of
the biggest moves *in the index*.

SESSION PROVENANCE (2026-07-31). The two heatmaps date themselves DIFFERENTLY,
and they are systematically one calendar day apart:

  * sp500_heatmap.json  `asof` = the last date in the daily CLOSE matrix
    (engine/sp500_heatmap.build_heatmap, ``closes_sorted.index[-1]``). That cache
    lags the live session, so at 21:25Z on 2026-07-30 the field read 2026-07-29
    while the tile 1D it labels had already been overlaid with the 07-30 tape.
  * themes_heatmap.json `asof` = the NYSE session the scrape's EOD numbers
    describe (scripts/fetch_finviz_themes ``_asof_stamp()``, via
    ``lib.nyse_calendar.session_date()`` since the #4584 calendar-asof heal: a
    post-close weekday run stamps that weekday; a weekend/holiday run stamps
    the last completed session) — the session actually being read. The
    measurement below predates that heal but is undisturbed by it: on weekdays
    the old ``datetime.now(timezone.utc)`` clock stamp and the session date
    coincide.

Measured over 14 consecutive commits (2026-07-30 13:34Z .. 2026-07-31 11:58Z)
the sp500 stamp was EXACTLY one day behind the themes stamp on every single one,
while the 1D numbers themselves agreed to 0.01pp across all 302 names the two
payloads share. A caller that dates BOTH row families by ``data["asof"]``
therefore mislabels the theme rows by a whole session (the mixed-asof failure),
and any freshness gate keyed on that field fails closed forever — which is
exactly what happened to the publish-time lane on 2026-07-31 (every in-window
sweep: pt_generated=0, pt_dropped=1, reason "tape stale").

So every ROW now carries the stamp of the artifact it actually came from, and the
payload keeps per-artifact stamps alongside the legacy ``asof`` (still the sp500
one, because the stocks-hub movers board and engine/press/desk_planner date their
S&P claims with it).

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Post tails, by direction.
#
# WHAT THIS REPLACES, AND WHY (operator voice law, 2026-07-31). These were four
# reply-bait questions per side — "Which one breaks out first?", "Dead-cat bounce
# or the real dip?", "Who's actually washed out here?" — and all four
# `publisher_live_movers` posts that have ever gone out ended on one. They are
# the exact shape the voice law bans: a question aimed at the reader that costs
# the author NOTHING. The desk names a move and then asks the timeline to do the
# thinking; there is no position, no watch-condition, and nothing that can later
# be shown to have been wrong.
#
# The 2026-07-31 replacements were stance-or-watch-condition tails that COST the
# author: each committed to doing nothing (or to waiting for a named condition)
# and then said the price of that choice out loud. That register is ITSELF
# retired now — see constraints 1, 2 and 7 — because it kept the author as the
# subject of the sentence, which is the disease v5 exists to end.
#
# THE STANDING RULE (Voice Doctrine v5, 2026-08-11): **the read is in the
# selection, not in a performed reaction.** The subject of every sentence is the
# MARKET. The tail is a declarative structural note about what the GROUP did —
# no narrator, no question, no instruction. Seven constraints shape every line:
#
#   1. **NO QUESTION MARK, EVER** (v5, 2026-08-11 — this INVERTS the v4 rule
#      that used to sit here). Constraints 1 and 2 used to read "it must end with
#      '?'" and "first person in the FINAL sentence", because
#      copywriter.validate_copy hard-REQUIRED a theme_list body to end on a
#      question mark and publish_time_content._tail_is_bait only spared a
#      trailing question that carried a first-person marker. Voice Doctrine v5
#      retires both: validate_copy's "?" requirement becomes a "?" BAN, and
#      _tail_is_bait simplifies to "any interrogative tail is bait", so the
#      first-person exemption those two rules granted is now itself the
#      violation. The tail is a STATEMENT.
#   2. **NO FIRST PERSON**, anywhere in the line. No I / I'm / I'd / my / we /
#      our / us. The v4 register performed a persona having feelings about a
#      trade; the subject of a v5 sentence is the MARKET. The read is in the
#      SELECTION — this lane already decided which group was worth a post — not
#      in a narrator reacting to it.
#   3. NO numbers. copywriter._NUMBER_RE screens every numeric token against the
#      facts whitelist, so a tail inventing "two closes" or "3 days" is a copy
#      violation that drops the whole candidate.
#   4. Direction-keyed, and the key is the SIGN OF THE AGGREGATE (see
#      _direction_of) — never a `direction` string a caller may have set
#      independently of the number it labels.
#   5. **48 CHARACTERS MAX, EACH.** This is a supply constraint, not a style
#      preference, and it is the defect the 2026-07-31 rewrite introduced. The
#      bank it replaced was four ~32-char reply-bait questions; the stance tails
#      came back at up to 80 chars — 2.5× longer — and the tail is appended to a
#      theme body that already carries a member list ("$AAPL +2.1% $MSFT +1.4%
#      …"). copywriter.validate_copy caps headline+body at 275 chars, so the
#      longest banks pushed the 'dry, receipts-forward' theme render to 282 and
#      the candidate was DROPPED as a copy violation. A tail that costs the
#      author nothing to write but costs the desk the whole post is not a voice
#      improvement. The study's reaction-word form is a SHORT verdict — one
#      breath — not a paragraph, so the budget and the voice law agree here.
#      (publish_time_content._render_copy_unbaited now also re-rolls onto other
#      variants on a too-long violation, which is the second net; this is the
#      first, and a bank that fits should never need the net.)
#   6. **NO TRADING INSTRUCTION, NOT EVEN A HEDGED ONE** (defect 4, operator
#      2026-08-03). Every line of the 2026-07-31 bank was a timing decision the
#      desk had not computed: "Does not chasing keep costing me money?", "I'd
#      rather be late. Am I paying for that?", "Am I too slow waiting for the
#      pullback?". Read as English those say *wait, do not chase, a pullback is
#      coming* — a directional call wearing a first-person hedge. The lane picks
#      the tail from a crc32 of the THEME NAME; nothing in that hash has ever
#      looked at a chart, so the "stance" is a coin flip that reads as ignorance
#      the half of the time it is wrong (the $FSLR post of 2026-08-03: "either
#      way I'd let it settle first", written over a name that had just crossed
#      up out of a two-month washout, which is the setup momentum traders buy).
#
#      The replacement kept the COST — the author admitted, on the record, that
#      he could not yet read the group — and dropped the instruction. This
#      constraint is UNCHANGED under v5: no instruction, hedged or otherwise.
#      ``copywriter.uncomputed_stance`` is the executable form of the rule and
#      ``tests/test_marketing_mover_stance.py`` walks both banks through it.
#
#   7. **THE TAIL IS A STRUCTURAL NOTE ABOUT WHAT THE GROUP DID** (Voice
#      Doctrine v5, 2026-08-11). Two earlier waves both kept the author as the
#      subject and both failed for it. The 2026-08-03 bank made him admit he
#      could not read the group ("Do I know why they all went at once?", "Is my
#      read on this group any good today?"); the operator: "it makes us look
#      indecisive and provides zero value... It kills authority and causes
#      unfollows." The 2026-08-06 bank moved the question onto the tape's next
#      move ("Am I getting a second session out of this?") but kept the "I" and
#      the "?", so it still read as a bot cosplaying a trader — measured across
#      the live queue, first person was 25.8% of the corpus and it is the single
#      biggest v5 scrub.
#
#      v5 removes the narrator entirely. The tail states something the theme
#      item ALREADY COMPUTED and the member list already proves: every listed
#      name moved the group's way (``in_dir`` filters to the direction before
#      the top-n slice), the aggregate is a group average over ≥ min_members
#      names, and the move is therefore breadth rather than one story. That is
#      the doctrine's material — breadth inside the group — and it is the only
#      material a crc32 of the theme name is entitled to: no streak, no rank, no
#      volume multiple, because nothing in this lane measured one. A tail
#      asserting "second straight session" here would be constraint 6's defect
#      wearing a fact's costume.
#
#      Direction-keying (constraint 4) does the rest of the work: a heavy group
#      and a bid group get different words for the same structural claim.

    """The honest phrase for "the session this move happened in" — "today",
    "on Friday", or "" when no word can be justified.

    ONE call site for a word that was hardcoded in four places in this module
    and two more in ``content_studio``. :func:`market_clock.temporal_vocab`
    decides what a fact stamped `asof` may be called at `now`.

    ``asof`` IS THE FIX FOR DEFECT 2 (operator, live posts 2026-08-03 ~17:30Z).
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This function used to take no `asof` at all: it inferred the fact's session
    from the CLOCK, as ``_clock.last_completed_session(now)``, on the premise
    stated in the old docstring — "a mover's percent is by construction the last
    COMPLETED session's". That premise is true for the NIGHTLY desk, which writes
    after the close about a finished session. It is FALSE for the publish-time
    lane (``engine/marketing/publish_time_content``), whose rows are the session
    IN PROGRESS, overlaid from the live tape.

    What that cost, exactly: a theme_list posted Monday 2026-08-03 at ~13:30 ET
    carried the live Monday tape, a headline reading "Virtual & Augmented Reality
    is up across the board today" and a card stamped 2026-08-03 — and a BODY
    reading "+3.7% on average on Friday", because ``last_completed_session`` at
    13:30 ET Monday is Friday 2026-07-31 (Monday's close has not happened yet).
    Three claims about which session it was, in one post.

    The session a fact belongs to is a property of the ROW, never of the wall
    clock, so the row's stamp is now passed in. ``asof=None`` keeps the old
    clock-inferred behaviour for the nightly callers that legitimately mean "the
    last completed session" (content_studio's plan-time day word), so this is an
    additive fix and no nightly copy changes.

    An unparseable / absent `asof` resolves to the empty phrase, not to a guess —
    the fact texts below join on truthiness, so the sentence simply carries no
    temporal word. Fail-closed, per market_clock's stated fail direction.

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The COMPUTED technical state (defect 4, operator 2026-08-03)
#
# THE DEFECT. The $FSLR mover post of 2026-08-03 read "FSLR surged +10.3% today
# (Technology). Real strength or real damage, either way I'd let it settle
# first." The operator: "this just did a daily MACD cross and is washed out
# after 2 months of downtrend... If it launched then the best thing to do is to
# chase in, since it already got washed. So us saying to let it settle is the
# dumbest thing ever and just ruins our reputation."
#
# The deeper fault is NOT that the stance pointed the wrong way. It is that the
# lane emitted a DIRECTIONAL STANCE IT HAD NEVER COMPUTED: a canned template
# sentence chosen by a hash of the ticker, over a chart nothing in the lane had
# read. A template that says "let it settle" on every large move is wrong about
# half the time by construction, and it looks ignorant exactly when it is.
#
# THE RULING (operator, 2026-08-03): we do not issue a directional trading
# stance we have not computed. Two lawful shapes remain:
#   (a) NO STANCE — the move plus what is observable, and stop.
#   (b) A COMPUTED state — the real technical situation the move landed on,
#       cited in plain words, which is a stance we have EARNED.
#
# This block is shape (b)'s producer, and it is deliberately the cheapest
# honest one available to this lane. The publish-time mover path already loads
# local daily bars for every item it ships (``chart_render.load_ohlcv_windowed``
# inside ``publish_time_content._resolve_card``), so the price history is
# already on the machine; the 50-day average and the length of the current run
# on one side of it are a dozen lines of arithmetic over those closes.
#
# WHY THE 50-DAY AND NOTHING ELSE. Three constraints, all of them the repo's
# own laws rather than a preference:
#   * MACD IS UNSAYABLE. ``copywriter._BANNED_VOCAB`` bans "macd" (and "rsi",
#     "vwap", "poc") outright: a study name the reader has to look up may not
#     appear in a post, whatever the chart labels. The operator's own diagnosis
#     is therefore not directly quotable, but the STATE it describes — a
#     washed-out name climbing back over its trend average — is.
#   * NO STAGE ARTIFACT REACHES THIS LANE. There is no per-ticker stage /
#     washout store keyed by an arbitrary S&P-or-pack ticker that the publisher
#     checkout carries; the daily parquets are what is genuinely available at
#     publish time, so they are what this reads.
#   * PLAIN WORDS AND NO NEW NUMBERS. Every phrase below spells its duration out
#     ("two months") rather than printing a figure, so nothing here has to be
#     licensed through the numbers whitelist, and none of them puts a bare
#     pronoun after a preposition ("under it") — that is the dangling-level
#     defect ``copywriter.dangling_levels`` exists to catch.
#
# A name whose bars are missing, short, or unreadable returns None and the
# writer falls back to shape (a). Degrading to "no stance" is always lawful;
# inventing one never is.
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    THE FSLR POSTMORTEM (operator, 2026-08-03). FSLR printed +10.3% the first
    session after a two-month, -35% slide — a washed-out name swinging off the
    lows, daily MACD crossing, good earnings — and the flagship posted "Real
    strength or real damage, either way I'd let it settle first." Every mover
    variant in the bank was the same context-blind caution, so a post about
    the most context-heavy tape event of the day read like it hadn't seen the
    chart it was attached to. The operator deleted it: "there's no settling in
    stocks that literally just got washed out and just began to rally."

    `closes` are daily closes INCLUDING the move day as the last element (the
    exact series the attached chart renders). The bucket is computed on the
    series BEFORE the move — where the move landed, not what it did. When the
    local store has not rolled yet (intraday: last row = the prior session),
    the window just shifts by one session, which moves no bucket at these
    thresholds — the shapes are three-month structures, not day-count trivia:

        up day    · prior 3m return <= -15% and prior close in the bottom 35%
                    of the 3m range                      -> "washout_bounce"

                    3m tape                              -> "breakout"
        down day  · prior close in the top 30% after a +10% 3m run
