"""engine/marketing/value_gate.py — the Gift-Grip-Proof publish gate (XG-W3).

The editorial constitution §7.1 gives the model:

    Publishability ≈ Gift × Grip × Voice fit × Proof
    Virality option value rises when a Bridge is present

Charter §2 adopts it as THE publish gate, "with Bridge as a non-blocking
virality marker — the constitution's own formula: Bridge raises option value, it
never blocks". This module is that gate, deterministic:

    Gift   what does the reader gain? (§7.2 informational-surplus test)
    Grip   why do they stop, feel, or remember? (a non-template hook)
    Proof  why should they believe it? (chart / stat / citation / instrument)
    Bridge who beyond the niche can transmit it? — MARKER ONLY, never blocks

WHAT THIS GATE IS, AND IS NOT.  It is a FLOOR that catches the failure modes the
constitution names by hand: restating the source ("we rewrote the headline is not
an answer"), a bare template stem with no hook, and an assertion with no evidence
object. It is NOT a quality oracle and does not pretend to score taste. Every
element is a deterministic, greppable predicate over the emitted text and its
own metadata — no model, no learned weight, no LLM. Charter §2 amendment 9
(LLM-never-scores) and the house epistemics law both bind here: this is
display-tier internal machinery, so it ships freely, but it may never call
itself calibrated.

CALIBRATION IS AN EMPIRICAL CONSTRAINT, NOT A PREFERENCE.  The XG-W3 gate
must not silently silence the two live desks. The thresholds below were tuned
against the committed `data/marketing/content_plan.json` — every one of the
flagship's and founder's deterministic posts must pass — and
`tests/test_marketing_desk_feeds.py` pins that as a regression fixture. The
per-kind proof tiers exist because the corpus says they must: education posts
are evergreen explainers carrying no number, no cashtag and no chart, and the
constitution's own surplus list admits "a memorable explanation" as a gift. A
uniform hard-evidence rule would have deleted them.

CALIBRATION WARNING — THE MARGIN IS ONE WORD (review F8).  The live-desk
regression passes because the corpus's terse headlines happen to contain a
device this module recognises: "The honest macro read" passes on the single word
"honest", "Macro, quick" on "quick". Delete that one adjective and the post
abstains for `grip:no_hook`. That is a THIN margin, and it means the 212/218
figure is evidence that the gate does not silence TODAY's templates — not
evidence that the thresholds are right. Two consequences: (1) a template edit
upstream can flip posts to abstaining without anyone touching this file, which
is why the frozen fixture exists; (2) nobody should read the pass rate as
validation of the bar. Before `value_gate.enforce` is flipped on, the corpus
must be extended to the kinds and languages the current sample does not cover —
see the PRE-ARMING TODO below.

PRE-ARMING REQUIREMENT — SATISFIED BY SCOPE, NOT BY COVERAGE (2026-07-30).

The requirement read: before `value_gate.enforce: true`, extend the regression
corpus beyond the observed kinds to the uncovered ones (wire, earnings, receipt,
reply, news, plus any franchise-shaped emission), to zh/CJK bodies, and to
weekend/holiday posts — because arming on ONE nightly plan from ONE market day in
ONE language is exactly the "validated on the generator it polices" error the
charter §8 register warns about.

The corpus was NOT extended. Arming was NARROWED to match it instead, which
answers the same objection without pretending to evidence nobody has:

  * `value_gate.enforce_kinds` in config/marketing.yml lists the eight kinds the
    154 stamped emissions in `data/marketing/outbox/items.jsonl` actually cover.
    An emission of any other kind keeps its verdict RECORDED and SHIPS, and the
    lane announces it as an unmeasured kind. Zero observations therefore buys
    zero authority, which is the house epistemics law applied to our own gate.
  * zh/CJK: the concern is real and remains open in `_words`/the grip lexicons,
    but it is not live on this surface — 0 of 210 outbox items contain a CJK
    codepoint. The X desks post English. If a zh desk is ever added, its kind
    arrives unmeasured and unpoliced by construction, which is the right default.
  * Weekend/holiday posts remain uncovered. They emit under the same kinds, so
    they ARE policed; this is the thinnest part of the arming and the first place
    to look if a weekend goes quiet.

WHAT THE FIRST ARMING GOT WRONG, kept here because the number was persuasive and
false: it read 22 abstentions as 22 editorial rejections, "grip 14" among them.
Grip reads the headline, and single-block producers pass none, so those 14 were
`headline=""` — plumbing, not judgment (see the note in `evaluate`). Corrected,
the same corpus abstains 12 of 154. A gate's own verdicts are the least safe
place to stop looking.

CJK IS UNBLOCKED, NOT SOLVED (review F7).  `_words()` counts CJK codepoints, and
the interrogative/compression devices accept full-width punctuation, so a zh post
is no longer STRUCTURALLY unable to pass — before this it was: a latin-only
tokenizer scored every Chinese body at 0 words and failed it on length alone. But
the remaining grip devices (contrast, evaluative, why-now, stance) are still
English lexicons, so a zh headline can currently only reach grip through a
number, an instrument, punctuation or a question mark. Closing that properly
needs zh device lists built against a real zh corpus — part of the pre-arming
work above, and the reason a zh abstention today is RECORDED and not acted on.

PROOF IS TIERED, AND THE TIER IS RECORDED.  `hard` (chart/media, a whitelisted
number, or a citation), `instrument` (a named instrument from our own universe —
for a watchlist post the claim IS list membership, and the ticker plus
provenance is the receipt), `reasoning` (an explicit decision rule or
conditional — the only tier `education` may rest on). The verdict records WHICH
tier carried the post, so a reviewer can see at a glance that a signal post
rested on a number and not on vibes, and so XG-W6 can tighten a tier once
telemetry exists.

LLM MAY ONLY DE-ESCALATE.  `deescalate()` turns a pass into an abstention. There
is deliberately no inverse. The guard in `tests/test_marketing_desk_feeds.py` is
CAPABILITY-shaped, not name-shaped (review F14): it walks the AST and requires
every `Verdict(...)` construction to sit inside a blessed constructor, and
requires `deescalate`'s own construction to hard-code `verdict="abstain"`. The
earlier name-scan version — "no function called promote/escalate" — would have
waved through a `_recheck()` that quietly rebuilt a Verdict with `proof=True`,
which is the shape this rule actually has to stop. A critic may veto; it may
never promote.
