"""engine.marketing.copy_auditor — the operator's stand-in over a whole batch.

Operator order 2026-07-30: "Have a LLM auditor approve or disapprove of planned
posts for at least 1 week. You need to ensure that the auditor knows what to look
out for and to be able to stop posts that are bad (bot like posts, doesn't make
sense, has errors, repetitive posts, and other things that you think i would
reject to as well as things that are very obvious errors in our system)."

WHY THIS EXISTS BESIDE THE CRITIC
---------------------------------
``copy_critic.cold_read_verdict`` judges ONE post as a reader with no context.
That catches a post which does not parse on its own. It structurally cannot
catch the defect that actually got a batch rejected:

    Five of six posts closed with the same sentence.

Nor can the deterministic gates. ``stock_closer_violations`` matches known
strings and exact repeats; it passed a batch where four posts said "respect the
strength, don't chase" in four different wordings. That is monotony a human sees
instantly and no regex sees at all.

So this auditor reads the WHOLE DAY AT ONCE and answers a different question:
*if a real person opened this account today and scrolled, would they follow, or
would they smell a bot?*

CONTRACT
--------
DE-ESCALATION ONLY. The auditor may CUT a post and must say why. It may never
rewrite one, never raise a score, never add a post, and never promote anything.
That is the house epistemics law (CLAUDE.md §Epistemics: "LLMs may only
de-escalate calibrated keys — never originate signals, scores, or escalations")
and it is what makes a model safe in a publishing path at all.

NEVER RAISES. Every failure returns verdicts, never an exception. What it does
NOT do is fail silently: an audit that could not run marks every post
``unaudited`` with the reason, and the publisher decides what to do with that.
During the operator's one-week probation the intended reading of ``unaudited``
is "hold", not "ship" — an unaudited batch is exactly the case the probation
exists to prevent.
