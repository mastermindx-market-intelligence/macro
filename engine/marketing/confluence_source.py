    #    h21.wr_mc_test, and `_score` RANKS on sqrt(edge_wr_test * wr_mc_test) —
    #    the same test statistic. Publishing the top of that ranking as "our
    #    signals have resolved higher 87.5% of the time" states an optimistically
    #    biased figure as a first-person TRACK RECORD. The repo's own epistemics
    #    law is explicit: display-tier until gauntleted, and "validated" is
    #    CI-enforced language. This lane was promoting a display-tier artifact to
    #    authority in the headline.
    #
    # 2. `n_fires` AND THE SPAN ARE UNIVERSE-POOLED, NOT PER-TICKER. They come
    #    off the COMBO row, so "when these signals line up on $SLB they've gone
    #    higher 87.5% of the time ... (72 times)" attributes 72 fires and a
    #    multi-decade span to one name that contributed a handful. Every number
    #    in that sentence was false about the ticker it named — the $N defect
    #    with a statistics degree.
