"""engine.marketing.chart_render — Pure-Python SVG price chart for Content Studio.

Public API (v1 — backward-compat, kept unchanged):
    load_closes(ticker, root, n=90) -> tuple[list[str], list[float]] | None
    macd_cross(closes)             -> dict|None   (internal signal only; never emitted)
    render_signal_chart(...)       -> str          (self-contained SVG, < 9 KB)

Public API (v2 — TrendSpider-grade terminal chart):
    load_ohlcv(ticker, root, n=90) -> tuple[dates, open, high, low, close, volume] | None
    load_ohlcv_timeframe(...)      -> ((bars), warmup) | None   (DAILY/WEEKLY/MONTHLY)
    resample_bars(...)             -> bars         (W-FRI / month-end aggregation)
    render_chart_v2(...)           -> str          (self-contained SVG, < 60 KB)
    render_earnings_card(...)      -> str          (branded earnings card SVG)
    resolve_logo(ticker, root)     -> str | None   (whitened data URI, cached)
    rasterize_svg(svg)             -> bytes        (PNG of that exact SVG; X rejects SVG)

v1 spec constraints (§2.2):
  - NO matplotlib, NO external deps beyond pandas/pyarrow for parquet reading.
  - macd_cross values are NEVER returned in any artifact or drawn on chart.
  - No "MACD", "RSI", "EMA", "cross" text anywhere in SVG output.
  - BUY marker: upward triangle + label in green #3ddc84.
  - Transparent background (viewBox only, no background rect).
  - < 9 KB per SVG.
  - No <script> tags.

v2 spec constraints (§2 anatomy + §3 decision):
  - show_indicators=True: subpanel labels (MACD/RSI/Volume) ARE shown — the win-rate
    framing is the hook; visible indicators make the chart credible and shareable.
  - Public POST BODY copy must stay clean of indicator vocabulary; SVG subpanel labels OK.
  - No <script> tags. All text _xesc'd. < 60 KB. Deterministic.

# SVG → PNG rasterizer (X rejects SVG; the POSTED image must be the SAME artwork
# the Content Studio preview shows)
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-07-26 incident)
# The publish path used to raster a SEPARATE hand-drawn PIL reimplementation of
# the v1 line chart (render_signal_chart_png) while the admin preview and the
# outbox artifact showed the v2 candlestick SVG. The two drifted: v2 grew
# candles, volume/MACD subpanels, the logo overlay and the footer marketing bar
# (mastermind-x.com + "Try Pro free for 7 days"); the PNG never followed. The
# account therefore posted a plain line chart with no URL and no CTA while the
# mockup promised the full card. Rasterizing the EXACT SVG we already rendered
# removes the second renderer, so preview and post cannot diverge again.
#
# Rasteriser = headless Chrome, matching scripts/make_favicon.py (the house
# choice; cairosvg/rsvg are not installed on the render hosts). It is also the
# right choice on the merits here: the admin preview IS browser-rendered SVG, so
# a Chrome raster is pixel-faithful to the mockup by construction.
#
# FAIL-SOFT: no Chrome (CI, ubuntu publish runner) → returns b"" and the caller
# falls back to the legacy PIL PNG. A missing rasteriser must never break the
# nightly or turn a post text-only.

# Marketing used to read data/stocks/ ALONE — 232 large caps — while Prophet
# picks the signals it publishes from data/baskets/ohlcv/, which carries 2,758
# names. So 30 of the 43 tickers in the plan had no bars ANYWHERE marketing could
# see them, and every post on those names was uncharted no matter what the
# content lane did. That is why the operator's $CBOE, $LKFN, $TEL and $CVI posts
# shipped bare on 2026-07-28: all four are baskets-only names. The engine that
# chose the ticker and the lane that draws it must look in the same place.
#
# Bonus: the baskets parquet carries a REAL `open` column, which data/stocks/
# does not — those candles no longer need the prev-close proxy.

#
# WHY THIS IS NOT THE massive_stock_day MISTAKE (see the note below): that store
# is keyed by BARE US tickers, so putting it in the default order let ~20k stale,
# unadjusted files SHADOW curated US bars. These trees cannot shadow anything —
# every name in them is exchange-qualified (`0700.HK`, `600519.SS`, `XIU.TO`) or
# underscore-prefixed (`_HSI`, `_GSPTSE`), both of which are unreachable as US
# tickers, and the US trees are still searched first regardless. They are also
# nightly-fresh and git-tracked, so they ship to the VPS the brain runs on.
#
# The one bare name in the set is data/hk/EEM.parquet (the EM ETF, carried as an
# HK benchmark). It exists in NEITHER US tree, so it shadows nothing — it simply
# stops being "no data".
#
# WHAT THIS FIXES: the Mastermind brain's whole chart surface — chart_digest (the
# Eyes), measure_line, render_inline_chart, the shareable cards — hangs off this
# ladder. Until now every one of them answered "no data" for EVERY Hong Kong,
# mainland-China and Canadian symbol, while the very same repo carried 1,678 A-share

    card whose SVG was correctly markerless still went to the timeline as a
    BUY-labelled v1 card the moment Chrome was missing — a fabricated
    recommendation attached to a named politician's trade, which is precisely
    what the filing lane's own docstring forbids. The SVG branch alone could
    never enforce that, because the SVG is not the image X receives.

    Deterministic: pure function of the inputs (no clock, no randomness), so two

    Dark-navy (#0E1420) bg, real Mastermind favicon lockup top-left (gradient tile +
    ascending-M path + MASTERMIND wordmark), TICKER+TIMEFRAME top-right, candlesticks
    with wicks (min 2px body), right price-axis (5-7 round levels), last-price pill,
    optional SMA50/SMA200 overlays, % change callout box (with duration), highlight
    zone + SETUP pill, stacked subpanels (volume / MACD / RSI), ghost watermark,
    company logo overlay (when logo_datauri provided or logo_root triggers auto-resolve),
    footer with URL + copyright.

    New kwargs:
        logo_datauri: pre-resolved whitened data URI — embedded as giant overlay in
            upper price area (TrendSpider signature move). Overrides ghost text when set.
        logo_root: if logo_datauri is None but logo_root is provided, calls
            resolve_logo(ticker, logo_root) to auto-fetch + cache the logo.
        avwap_overlay: {"values": list[float|None], "label": str} — anchored VWAP
            curve drawn in house indigo (#7c5cff) under candles, over SMA.
        poc_overlay: {"poc": float, "va_low": float, "va_high": float, "label": str}
            — volume point-of-control dashed line + value area band.
        level_overlay: {"price": float, "label": str} — ONE labeled dashed
            horizontal line at the price the post copy cites (weekend-levels
            contract: the text may only name a level the chart draws — the
            2026-07-27 $AVGO post cited "the POC at 379.32" over a card that
            drew no such line). Drawn only when the price is inside the
            visible axis range; label chip uses the same reserved-lane system
            as the M2 overlays.
        Both default None; None and omitted are byte-identical to each other.
        NOTE vs pre-M2 output: the SMA layer now paints UNDER the candles (it
        used to paint over them) so the M2 overlays could slot between —
        a deliberate, designer-approved z-order change for ALL charts.

    Annotation grammar (TrendSpider-hardening PR-A; every kwarg below is
    optional and OFF by default — an omitted set renders byte-identical output,
    which tests/test_chart_render_grammar.py pins against a committed golden):

        log_scale: draw the price pane on a log axis and print
            ``TICKER WEEKLY (LOG)`` in the header. Silently ignored when the
            visible low is <= 0. Every annotation primitive maps through the
            same py_price(), so all of them follow the log axis for free.
        runway_frac: fraction of the plot width left EMPTY to the right of the
            last bar (the corpus's "future runway": last bar at 60-85% of
            frame). Clamped to [0, 0.40]. None keeps the current full-width
            behaviour exactly.
        mas: [{"kind": "sma"|"ema", "length": int, "color"?: str}] — arbitrary
            moving averages with an inline same-colour end label ("200 EMA").
            When given it REPLACES the legacy 50/200 SMA pair; when omitted the
            legacy pair is unchanged.
        spotlights: [{"index": int, "price"?: float, "tense": "past"|"now"|
            "damage", "label"?: str}] — translucent circle discs. Blue-grey =
            a historical instance, gold = "you are here", red = damage. The
            optional 2-6 word label prints in the disc's own colour.
        zones: [{"lo": float, "hi": float, "start_index"?: int,
            "end_index"?: int, "label"?: str}] — translucent supply/demand
            BANDS (floored at 10px of visual weight; a S/R zone is never a
            hairline). Painted under the candles as structure, not ink.
        trendlines: [{"from_idx": int, "from_price": float, "to_idx": int,
            "to_price": float, "style"?: "solid"|"dotted", "extend"?: bool}] —
            white annotation ink; solid = structural, dotted = diagnostic.
            extend projects the line to the right edge (through the runway).
        arcs: [{"indices": [int, ...], "side": "under"|"over", "label"?: str}]
            — a smooth curve through the given swing points, so a formation
            reads as interpretation rather than as a polyline of clutter.
        measure_box: {"from_index": int, "to_index": int, "from_price"?: float,
            "to_price"?: float} — anchor-to-anchor arrow plus the arithmetic
            receipt ``-95.09 (-23.32%) / 2 bars (2 weeks)``, coloured by sign
            and clamped fully inside the canvas.
        level_tags: [{"price": float, "color": str, "label"?: str}] —
            additional right-axis tags in an indicator's own colour: the
            in-frame restatement device that lets a screenshot survive
            decontextualisation.

    Sub-panes: ``indicators`` accepts "volume", "macd", "rsi", "streak"
    (signed consecutive same-colour candle count — the y-unit IS a streak
    claim's unit) and "squeeze" (BB(20,2) inside Keltner(20,1.5) state dots +
    momentum histogram). Hard-capped at 2 panes, per the corpus grammar.

    Returns self-contained SVG (<60KB). No <script>. All text _xesc'd.

# v2: Watchlist share-card renderer (multi-ticker theme lists — docket D-WL)
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Design intent (docs/DESIGN_DOCTRINE.md + frontend-design skill):
#   Multi-ticker posts ("Social media selling off: $SNAP -3.4% $RBLX -4.3% …")
#   used to ship as bland text. This card reframes them as a SCREENSHOT OF A
#   PREMIUM SAAS WATCHLIST PANEL — the third member of the earnings / breaking
#   card family (dark #0E1420 base, favicon lockup + wordmark, _brand_bar CTA
#   footer). Where the sibling cards are editorial POSTERS (one centered hero),
#   a watchlist is a PRODUCT surface: dense, rhythmic, scannable rows that read
#   like live app cells, so the reader feels they are looking over the shoulder
#   of someone using the terminal — not reading a caption.
#
# Signature element: every row is a raised cell (plate + hairline) fronted by a
#   thin vertical accent SPINE tinted to that row's direction (up green / down
#   red), while the panel title carries the house indigo→blue gradient of the
#   _brand_bar laser. The spines rhyme with the footer laser and bind the rows
#   into a single "watchlist object". Per-row 10-session sparklines (direction-
#   colored) are what actually sell "live watchlist, not a text post"; a row
#   with no price history degrades to no sparkline — never a broken glyph.
#
# Palette is 100% inherited (no invented colors): family up #4CAF50 / down
#   #E23B3B, base #0E1420, header #0A1020, hairline #232A3D, muted ink #6b7a99,
#   house gradient #5b9dff→#7c5cff. Pills reuse the earnings-card chip idiom
#   (colored fill at 0.16 opacity + colored ink) so they read as native.

# Deterministic monogram-tile palette — house-gradient siblings, used only when
# a company logo cannot be resolved. Each is a (top, bottom) gradient pair.

# Avatar-chip plates — the mount a brand mark sits on.
#
# WHY TWO (defect, live 2026-08-03): the card mounted every mark on ONE near-white
# disc. The nvstly source set is a DARK-THEME icon set — measured over 70 CDN
# marks, 36 (51%) put less than half their ink above 3:1 against that white disc,
# and 16 are pure-white knockouts at contrast ratio 1.00:1. COHR / LITE / AXON /
# RBLX shipped to the flagship as blank white circles. The mirror is just as real:
# JPM, WFC, LIN, DHR, NFLX are near-black marks that vanish on anything dark. No
# single plate serves both families, so the plate is CHOSEN per mark, measured.
#
# The two plates are tonal siblings, not opposites: identical silhouette, diameter,
# inner padding, rim weight and sheen direction — only the finish changes, paper or
# slate. A column that mixes them reads the way a phone home screen does (some app
# icons are light, some dark), which is honest, because that IS what the brand marks
# are. What would read as broken is a mark repainted to fit one plate: we do not
# recolour someone's logo, we change what it stands on.
#
# Each plate lists EVERY colour under the mark (both gradient stops). The
# legibility score must clear the floor against the worst of them — a mark is never
# scored on the friendlier half of a gradient.

    color-logo avatar chip + ticker/name + 10-session sparkline +
    right-aligned price + colored % pill), and the shared _brand_bar CTA footer.
    The third member of the earnings / breaking card family.

    v2 (portrait, mobile-first): defaults are 1080×1350 (4:5) — the tallest image
    X renders un-cropped in a phone timeline. The canvas is assumed displayed at
    ~390px wide (2.8x downscale), so type is sized generously (tickers/prices
    ~44-52px on canvas) and nothing on-canvas is smaller than ~26px. The signature
    is the RANK RAIL: the magnitude order is a true sequence, so each cell carries
    its ordinal on a left spine fused with the direction accent.

    Args:
        title: Theme / list name (the hero, e.g. "Social media selling off").
        rows: List of dicts, each {ticker, name (optional), price, pct_change}.
            4-8 rows typical; 3-10 handled gracefully via height auto-scaling.
            price / pct_change may be None → the cell degrades cleanly (no pill /
            no price) rather than printing a placeholder dash.
        as_of: Optional as-of stamp shown in the panel header (e.g. "Jul 20").
        logo_root: If provided, each row's logo is auto-resolved + cached via
            resolve_color_logo(ticker, logo_root) — the ORIGINAL full-color icon,
            housed in an avatar chip whose finish (paper or slate) is measured
            from the mark's own pixels so the mark always clears 3:1 against what
            it stands on. Rows with no resolvable logo — or a mark legible on
            neither finish — fall back to a deterministic circular gradient
            monogram, so the avatar column never contains a blank hole.
        subtitle: Optional one-line plain-word stance under the title
            (Tier-1 doctrine: every panel answers "so what do I do"). Omitted
            cleanly when None.
        width: Card width in px (default 1080; back-compat — pass 1000 for the
            old landscape geometry).
        height: Card height in px (default 1350 = 4:5 portrait). Pass None to
            auto-scale to the row count instead (old behavior); explicit height
            wins over both.

    Returns:
        Self-contained SVG string. No <script>. All text _xesc'd. Deterministic.

        (a caller signals "leave my order" by passing rows already in order — we

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# v2: Breaking-news card renderer (Radar / Breaking Desks — docket D05)
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Design intent (see docs/DESIGN_DOCTRINE.md + research/marketing_dockets/D05):
#   The SOURCE is the hero, not the scream. This is an accountable market-
#   intelligence brand, so the signature element is a self-grading credibility
#   chip — the tier the card actually used (official > wire > aggregator) is
#   encoded in the chip's *weight* so an aggregator can never look as
#   authoritative as an official feed (the anti-laundering trap is law).
#   Amber (#F5A623) is the breaking accent — urgent like a wire dateline, not
#   tabloid red (red stays reserved for "down" price semantics). The card never
#   adds interpretation ("bullish") — stance lives in the signal lanes.
#
# Tier chip system (weight = trust):
#   official    → filled amber, dark ink        (strongest)
#   wire        → amber outline, hollow          (medium)
#   aggregator  → grey outline, muted            (visibly lighter, honest)

# Shared with render_breaking_card; kept module-private.
_BREAK_AMBER = "#F5A623"       # breaking accent — wire-dateline urgency, not tabloid red
_BREAK_GREY = "#6b7a99"        # family neutral (matches earnings-card muted ink)
_BREAK_UP = "#4CAF50"          # family up-color
_BREAK_DOWN = "#E23B3B"        # family down-color
_BREAK_BODY = "#C8D4EA"        # summary ink — raised from #a7b4cc (see _BREAK_BODY_MIN)

# ── Legibility floor (W4g, operator 2026-08-02: "text too small for both
# mobile and web") ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The card is authored on a 1000px-wide canvas and rasterized ×2 to a 2000×1120
# PNG.  In an X timeline on a phone the media well is ~340–360 CSS px wide, so
# every design px lands on screen at ~0.34 CSS px.  The old 15.5px summary
# therefore arrived at ~5.3 CSS px — smaller than any readable caption.  This
# floor (26 design px ≈ 8.8 CSS px on a 340px well, ≈ 9.4 on a 360px well) is
# the size below which the body stops being readable at arm's length; it is a
# LEGIBILITY FLOOR, not a style preference, and the fitter may never go under it.
_BREAK_BODY_MIN = 26.0
# Character bounds for what a card can hold at that floor.  Derived from the
# geometry, not taste: 4 lines × ~68 mixed-case chars at 26px across the 890px
# text column.  A headline longer than this is compressed to whole sentences
# UPSTREAM (see derive_card_headline) so the renderer never has to clip.
_BREAK_HEADLINE_MAX_CHARS = 180
# THE SUMMARY BUDGET IS MEASURED, NOT DECLARED — see card_summary_budget_chars()
# below (it needs the glyph metrics, which are defined further down this module).
#
# Two hand-written constants used to sit here — 240 chars ("4 body lines") and
# 170 ("3 body lines") — and NOTHING read either of them. The renderer wrapped
# whatever it was handed, capped at 3 lines, and hard-clipped the remainder with
# an ellipsis; the producer meanwhile writes to breaking_summary._MAX_SUMMARY_CHARS
# = 320. No two of those three numbers agreed, and the smallest was still ~30
# chars over the box, so a summary written exactly to spec was ALWAYS ellipsised.
# On a static PNG there is no "read more" (operator law 2026-08-05), so the three
# live RADAR cards of 2026-08-04/05 each stopped mid-clause. The real capacity of
# the 3-line box is what card_summary_budget_chars() MEASURES (129 chars of
# mixed-case prose on the 1080 card at the time of writing, and whatever the
# geometry says thereafter — the function is the number, not this comment; a
# figure stated here that its own measurement contradicts is the same class of
# defect this note is about). A number the renderer
# cannot honour is the defect, so the declared numbers are gone and the box
# measures itself.


# ── Glyph metrics ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Every wrap on this card used to be a raw CHARACTER COUNT, so the char budgets
# and the font sizes drifted apart whenever either moved (the 15.5px summary was
# set to 84 chars — ~651px of an available 908px column, a permanently underset
# line).  These are Helvetica advance widths in 1/1000 em; `sans-serif` resolves
# to Helvetica on the macOS render host and to a metric-compatible Arial clone
# on Linux.  Deterministic, no font library, no I/O.

    """The slug-chip text: the tier, and the publication name ONLY if admitted.

    OPERATOR LAW 2026-08-05 — NEVER BRAND THE SOURCE. Three live RADAR cards
    (Aug 4-5) printed "ZeroHedge · WIRE SERVICE", "CNBC · WIRE SERVICE" and
    "ForexLive · WIRE SERVICE". We are a markets desk; putting another
    publication's masthead in our own card art advertises them, and it claims a
    relationship with a newsroom we do not have.

    The rule BEFORE that was the inverse: print "<publication> · <TIER>" and fall
    back to the tier only when the name matched a six-entry denylist of generic
    placeholders ("newswire", "wire", "unknown", ...). That list could not match
    a real outlet by construction, so the suppressor never once fired on the case
    it was needed for. Every real masthead printed, by design.

    OPERATOR RULING 2026-08-06 — "NAME REAL NEWSWIRES ONLY", which narrows the
    blanket kill above. The 08-05 law took CNBC down with ZeroHedge and
    ForexLive; a real newswire or a primary source may be named, and everything
    else may not. The admission is a CONFIG ALLOWLIST, default-deny, resolved by
    engine.marketing.source_authority.card_chip_name against
    config/press_sources.yml ``citation.card_chip`` — see that function for the
    policy. The list lives in config so the operator can move a masthead without
    a deploy; nothing in this module carries a built-in name.

    WHAT THE CHIP SHOWS NOW:

      * official tier, name admitted   → "Federal Reserve · OFFICIAL SOURCE"
      * official tier, name not on it  → "OFFICIAL SOURCE"
      * wire tier, name admitted       → "CNBC · WIRE SERVICE"
      * wire tier, name not on it      → "WIRE SERVICE"   (ZeroHedge, ForexLive)
      * aggregator/unknown/mirror tier → NOTHING. The chip is drawn as the tier
        seal alone (see the caller), and the name is refused before the list is
        even read. The tier carries no badge word and this function does not
        invent one.

    ``chip_cfg`` ABSENT MEANS NO NAME, and that is the safe default rather than
    an oversight: a lane that has not been given the operator's list has no basis
    for printing a masthead, so it prints the caption alone (the 2026-08-05
    behaviour). engine/marketing/earnings_call_lane passes none on purpose — a
    card that signs itself is not a citation, and "Earnings call transcript" is a
    description of an artefact, not a masthead.

    IT DOES NOT INVENT A CAPTION FOR THE UNLABELLED TIER (fixed 2026-08-06). A
    first pass filled the empty pill with "RELAYED REPORT", which turns a
    deliberately silent grade into a positive CLAIM — and the aggregator tier is
    where every UNKNOWN tier routes, including a company's own earnings-call
    transcript and a Truth Social direct quote. Both are primary artefacts, and
    the card was telling the reader they were somebody else's relayed report.
    An empty caption says nothing, which is the honest thing to say when the
    grade is "we have not classified this". A lane that has a positive grade to
    make passes ``source_tier`` for it (the transcript lane now says
    ``official``); it does not get a caption by default.

    THIS IS THE ONE DOOR. Every name that reaches the card art comes through
    here, so the allowlist cannot be dodged by a lane assembling its own chip
    string — pinned by
    tests/test_marketing_card_earns_pixels.py::test_a_chip_never_carries_an_unadmitted_name.
    There is deliberately no own-desk carve-out and no `citation` override: both
    shipped in an earlier pass and neither could fire in production (the desk
    allowlist matched @handles against a display-name field), and default-deny
    now covers our own desks without a special case.

    The tier is ALSO carried by the chip's weight, fill, stroke, rail and its
    ``bc-tier-*`` class, so the anti-laundering signature (D05) is untouched: an
    aggregator still cannot look like an official print.

#: an ellipsis. With clipping forbidden the alternative to a rung is a VOID — the

    The card belongs to the render_earnings_card visual family (dark #0E1420

    self-grading SOURCE-TIER chip: the tier actually used is encoded in the
    chip's weight (official = filled amber / wire = amber outline / aggregator =
    muted grey outline), so an aggregator can never be laundered as an official
    print (docket D05 trap — this is law). The model behind this card only
    summarizes-with-citation; the card adds no interpretation.

    LAYOUT (rebuilt 2026-08-02 — the 1000×560 landscape card was illegible in a
    phone feed and carried a void where the copy ran out). The canvas is square
    by default and the composition is a wire slip read top to bottom: masthead,
    amber dateline rule, desk eyebrow, THE NEWS at poster scale, the summary as
    an indented second voice, then the provenance slug (tier chip + timestamp)
    sitting where a wire service puts its source line — under the copy, not in
    front of it. The headline is width-FITTED against a type ladder rather than
    bucketed by character count, so it is as large as the words allow and never
    below the AG-3 legibility floor unless it is clipped instead. Vertical slack
    is distributed around the copy block (optically centred, biased high), which
    is what removes the dead space rather than hiding it.

    Args:
        headline: The breaking headline (hero). ANY length is safe: it is first
            compressed to whole sentences by derive_card_headline, then wrapped
            with MEASURED glyph widths against a size ladder — so it is never
            truncated with an ellipsis, at any length (W4g).
        source_name: Display name of the source ("Reuters", "Federal Reserve").
            DRAWN ONLY IF `chip_cfg` ADMITS IT — see _break_chip_label and the
            operator ruling of 2026-08-06. With no chip_cfg the chip shows the
            tier caption alone, which is the 2026-08-05 behaviour.
        source_tier: "official" | "wire" | "aggregator" (unknown → aggregator).
        chip_cfg: The operator's citation config block (config/press_sources.yml
            `citation`), carrying the `card_chip` name allowlist. None/absent =
            default-deny: no publication name is drawn.
        published_at: ISO8601 UTC timestamp — the ONLY time input (deterministic).
        tickers: Optional [{"ticker","price","pct"}, ...]; capped at 4, house
            up/down coloring; strip omitted entirely when empty/None.
        suppress_cta: Sentinel tone rule — True on human-tragedy items removes
            the trial CTA line so the footer collapses to just the brand mark.
            Distinct from `cta`: this one is PER-ITEM tone (and also drops the
            URL); `cta` is the account-wide posture knob.
        cta: False drops the trial button from the ordinary footer while keeping
            the URL lockup (publish.chart_cta_enabled — see chart_cta_enabled()).
            Ignored when suppress_cta is set, which already removes everything.
        summary: Optional ≤2-sentence cited summary; omitted cleanly when None.
        event_class: Optional relevance class ("macro_print"|"policy"|
            "geopolitical"|"company_news") rendered as a quiet plain-word
            kicker beside the BREAKING eyebrow; unknown/none/None → omitted
            (the raw snake_case key is never shown — plain-word law).
        eyebrow: Plain-word desk label. Defaults to ``BREAKING`` for full
            backward compatibility; deterministic derivative lanes may supply
            a truthful sibling label such as ``EARNINGS CALL``.
        logo_root: Reserved for future logomark use; text cashtags are used now.
        fit: Optional caller-owned dict, populated with what the card actually
            DREW (the out-param idiom press_lane already uses for `refusal`).
            Keys: ``summary_source_chars``, ``summary_card_chars``,
            ``summary_chars_dropped``, ``summary_drawn``, ``headline_drawn``.
            This exists because the gates upstream were scoring text the reader
            never saw — the full card_summary against a box that draws at most
            three lines of it. Left untouched on the fail-soft path, so a caller
            that reads a missing key knows the render degraded.
        width, height: Card dimensions. Default 1080×1080 (square — the
            universal feed canvas); pass 1080×1350 for the tall 4:5 variant when
            the content warrants the extra room. Both are AD_MASTER_PAPER §4.1

            NO CLIPPED SECOND VOICE. The overflow signal used to be discarded at
            this call site (`sm_lines, _ = _bc_wrap_w(...)`), which is how a
            320-char summary was drawn as three lines ending mid-clause on a
            static image while provenance reported a clean fit.

            PREFERENCE ORDER, most desirable first:

              1. the largest rung that places the WHOLE summary inside the tidy
                 block height (_BC_SM_MAX_BLOCK_H — "do not dominate the hero");
              2. the largest rung that places the whole summary using ALL the
                 room left below the hero. Completeness outranks tidiness: the
                 block-height rule is a heuristic about balance, and dropping a
                 sentence to honour it while leaving the column visibly empty is
                 the "too much whitespace" defect wearing a rule as a costume;
              3. whatever drops the least, largest size first.

            STAGE 2 IS BOUNDED (fixed 2026-08-06). It used to take whatever fit
            below the hero — up to ~15 lines at 26px on a 1080 square — which
            abandoned the very rule stage 1 is named for. Measured then: hero
            "Fed holds", a 306-char summary, TWO hero lines against SEVEN
            summary lines. Seven lines of second voice under two of hero is not
            a card with a note, it is a note with a headline, and nothing in the
            suite could see it. The cap is now stated in HERO LINES —
            _BC_SM_LINES_PER_HERO_LINE per hero line, never more than
            _BC_SM_LINES_HARD — so "do not dominate the hero" survives a rung
            step-down instead of being traded away by it.

            Never below the AG-3 body floor, and never a clipped line at any
            rung — the no-clip law outranks every preference above.
