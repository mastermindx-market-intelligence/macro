"""engine.marketing.receipt_source — REAL receipts from graded Prophet plan outcomes.

Produces concrete receipt dicts from Prophet plans that have graded outcomes
(T1/T2 DONE hits, invalidations, or both on the same plan = "mixed").

Public API:
    graded_receipts(plans, *, closes_loader=None, today=None) -> list[dict]

Each returned dict:
    {
        "ticker": str,
        "kind": "win" | "loss" | "mixed",
        "signal_date": str,          # YYYY-MM-DD
        # win fields (present on "win" and "mixed"):
        "entry": float,
        "target": float,
        "gain_pct": float,           # e.g. 9.6 for +9.6%
        "gain_pct_str": str,         # e.g. "+9.6%"
        "target_label": str,         # e.g. "T1"
        # loss fields (present on "loss" and "mixed"):
        "entry": float,
        "stop": float,               # the invalidation level
        "loss_pct": float,           # e.g. -6.4 (negative)
        "loss_pct_str": str,         # e.g. "-6.4%"
    }

Freshness: signal_date must be within *max_age_days* of today (default 14).
Priority: mixed > win > loss when deduplicating per ticker.

#: How far back a RESOLVED plan may be and still be worth a receipt post.
#:
#: WAS 14, AND THAT IS WHY THE RECEIPTS DESK HAD NEVER PRODUCED ONE (2026-07-31).
#: The window was set to a freshness intuition; the measurement disagrees. On the
#: live `site/prophet/index.json` (63 plans) exactly six had a resolved outcome —
#: three with a DONE profit level, three invalidated — and their signal dates were
#: 21 to 22 days old. Every one of them fell outside a 14-day window, so the desk
#: drew its share of the nightly tilt and emitted nothing, permanently, while six
#: real receipts sat just past the edge.
#:
#: The mismatch is structural, not a bad week: Prophet's swing horizon is 2-4
#: weeks (a target takes that long to hit or fail), so a window shorter than the
#: horizon it grades can only ever be empty. 30 days covers the horizon with room
#: for the grading lag.
#:
#: A receipt is not a tape claim and does not decay like one. "Three weeks ago I
#: said X, here is how it resolved" is a STRONGER post than a three-day-old one,
#: because the outcome is settled — and it is the one post shape that pays a cost
#: to make, which is the house voice law. Overridable per-call and from config
#: (`copywriter.receipt_max_age_days`) so tightening it back is one line.
