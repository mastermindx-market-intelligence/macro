"""engine.marketing.breaking_relevance — Deterministic relevance filter.

Enforces:
- NO LLM anywhere in this module (docket law: the model never decides whether
  something is market-moving; the deterministic salience score does).
- Salience is a sum of observable, logged components so every scoring decision
  is auditable and reproducible.
- event_class taxonomy assigned by keyword match only (ordered, first-match wins).
- cta_suppress is deterministic keyword-list only (tragedy/human-harm items).
- market_hours_weight computed from US/Eastern clock — deterministic from `now`.

XG-W5 (the scoring brain, IS-W2) EXTENDS this module rather than forking it:
``score_item`` now also emits ``_components`` — the L0 story reference plus the
six deterministic L1 features (engine/marketing/signal_features.py) and the
ordering ``rank_score``. Three invariants hold and are test-pinned:

  1. ``_components`` IS EMITTED FOR EVERY ITEM, with or without a context. A
     missing input becomes a named state ("cold-start", "neutral-prior",
     "absent", "no-context"), never a missing key — that is what makes
     "features for 100% of ingested items" a checkable claim.
  2. ``salience`` IS UNCHANGED BY THE L1 LAYER unless the operator explicitly
     arms demotion, and demotion can only ever LOWER it (the multiplier is
     clamped at 1.0). No feature can lift an item over a publish floor.
  3. ``rank_score`` IS AN ORDERING NUMBER ONLY. Nothing downstream compares it to
     a gate; see the "gate ordering" block in press_lane.run_press_tick.

``_salience_components`` keeps its exact historical shape for every existing
reader; ``_components["salience"]`` carries the same numbers in the new home.

Public API:
    score_item(item, *, now=None, universe=None, cfg=None, context=None) -> dict
        Decorates item with relevance fields per schema.
    rank_items(items, *, now=None, universe=None, cfg=None) -> list[dict]
        Returns items sorted by salience desc.

# `_MACRO_PRINT_KEYWORDS` knew the Fed by its FURNITURE — "fomc", "rate
# decision", "fed funds", "basis points", "federal reserve decision" — and by
# nothing the decision itself is ever written in. Measured on the live
# classifier before this list existed:
#
#   none         base=0.0   Fed holds rates steady, Powell signals September cut…
#   none         base=0.0   Fed leaves rates unchanged at 4.25%-4.50%
#   none         base=0.0   Fed cuts rates for the first time since 2024
#   none         base=0.0   Powell says the committee is not in a hurry to cut
#   macro_print  base=55.0  Federal Reserve cuts interest rates by 25 basis points
#   macro_print  base=55.0  FOMC statement: policy remains restrictive
#
# A base of 0.0 cannot reach `breaking.salience_threshold: 60` under ANY source
# tier (the largest bonus in `_TIER_BONUS` is official's +15), so the single most
# market-moving macro headline this lane can receive could not post at all. The
# two that DID classify were accidents of wording: a wire that writes "cuts rates
# by a quarter point" rather than "by 25 basis points" scored zero for the same
# event. This is the same shape of defect as the flat-tier one
# `macro_print_tier` fixes — a vocabulary that reads the FORM of a headline and
# calls it the CONTENT — one layer earlier, in the classifier itself.
#
# NOTHING IS TAKEN FROM `policy`. The taxonomy is first-match-wins and
# `macro_print` sits directly above `policy`, so a term that also reads as policy
# would silently re-address existing items. The one collision candidate in
# `_POLICY_KEYWORDS` is "interest rate cap" (singular "rate"), which is why bare
# "interest rate"/"interest rates" are ABSENT below and the plural only ever
# appears bound to a decision verb ("cuts interest rates"). Pinned by
# `test_rate_decision_vocabulary_steals_nothing_from_policy`.

#: Conjugations × objects, GENERATED rather than hand-listed. `_MACRO_REVISION_RE`
#: further down records why: an exact-phrase list written from guesses missed
#: four of the five real phrasings on its first calibration run. A wire writes "cuts
#: rates", "cut interest rates", "is cutting rates" and "kept rates on hold"
#: interchangeably, and the cross product is the only form of this list that
#: cannot be short by a tense.

#
# The wire is a RELAY by charter (breaking_summary.validate_summary rejects
# stance words outright; wire_voice's prompt says "no interpretation, no
# stance"), and that is the right design for a genuine flash: speed and accuracy

# Measured on the live classifier, "SWITZERLAND (JUL) CPI CORE YOY" and "US CPI
# rises 0.3% m/m" are byte-identical at 55.0, and "Unite Secures Inflation-
# Beating 10.5% Pay Package Increase For GXO Drivers In Bellshill" scores 55.0
# as a macro print off the bare word "inflation". `wire_routing.classes` then
# sends all three to the flagship, because the routing table knows the CLASS and
# not the RELEASE.
#
# The operator, reading seven consecutive flagship wire posts of which none was
# a top-tier US release: "These posts are so boring... These arent the ones
# people really care about."
#
# TWO DIMENSIONS, BOTH REQUIRED, because either one alone still ships the
# complaint. Tier alone keeps GERMANY RETAIL SALES (a tier-1 TOPIC) on the brand
# account; economy alone keeps the US trade balance and JOLTS there.
#
# THIS IS A ROUTING INPUT, NOT A SCORE AND NOT A KILL. Nothing here changes a
# salience, and nothing here drops an item: a minor print goes to the desk whose
# charter job is stance-free relay (`macro_print.minor` in wire_routing.classes)
# rather than to the desk that exists to carry a house view. Same shape as
# `macro_revision_penalty` above — "stop relaying things that are not news" —
# except the verdict is an ADDRESS rather than a demotion, so the record stays
# complete and only the brand account gets quieter.
#
# The bare word "inflation" is deliberately ABSENT from the tier-1 vocabulary.
# It is the token that put a UK trucking-union pay settlement on the flagship,
# and a genuine CPI/PCE print always says so by name.

#: artifacts. A headline carrying one of these needs no separate proof that a
