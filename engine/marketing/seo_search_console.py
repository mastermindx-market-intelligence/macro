"""engine.marketing.seo_search_console — Google Search Console ingestion adapter.

MKT-SEO-07 W0  (Beacon dept).  Wraps the Search Analytics REST API (v3), the
Sitemaps API (v3) and the URL Inspection API (v1) using raw HTTP + google-auth
bearer tokens.  Fully offline when credentials absent — writes explicit
unavailable state artifacts, never a healthy zero.

Public API (all fail-soft — no public function raises out of ``run``):
  load_sa_info(*, creds_path=None) -> tuple[dict | None, str | None]
  fetch_search_analytics(creds, prop, start_date, end_date, ...) -> list[dict]
  fetch_sitemaps(info, prop, *, token=None) -> dict
  inspect_urls(info, prop, urls, *, token=None, pace_s=...) -> list[dict]
  run(root, *, creds_path=None, days=28, as_of=None, write=True) -> dict

Artifacts written under data/marketing/seo/:
  search_console_state.json         — always (available bool + metadata)
  search_console_index_status.json  — always (sitemap + URL-inspection diagnostics)
  search_console_daily.parquet      — only when available; append-dedupe + 16-month cap
  page_family_scorecard.json        — only when available
  query_gaps.json                   — only when available

Credential resolution (checked in order):
  1. explicit creds_path param            (a FILE PATH — read it)
  2. env GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS   (a FILE PATH — read it)
  3. env GSC_SA_JSON                      (raw JSON string from the CI secret)

The JSON is parsed ONCE, in-process, and handed to
``service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_info`` — no key material ever
touches disk on our side.  Parsing is deliberately forgiving of the one failure
mode the operator actually hit: a DOUBLE-ENCODED secret (the JSON pasted
quote-wrapped, i.e. ``json.dumps`` applied twice).  google-auth's
``from_service_account_file`` does ``json.load(f)`` then ``.keys()`` on the
result, so a double-encoded blob crashes with the opaque
``'str' object has no attribute 'keys'``.  ``load_sa_info`` unwraps up to two
layers of string encoding and, past that, says exactly what is wrong — including
a content-free SHAPE fingerprint of the rejected payload (``_describe_shape``:
category label + character count, never the payload) so the operator does not
spend a 30-60 min CI cycle per guess about what they actually pasted.

CLI:
  python -m engine.marketing.seo_search_console --root . [--days 28] [--dry-run]
  Prints compact summary.  exit 0 even when unavailable; exit 1 only on crash.

Dependency: google-auth (in requirements.txt) for service-account bearer tokens.
Soft-import: if not installed, writes unavailable state with reason.

SECURITY: ``private_key`` (and any other key material) is NEVER logged, never
printed, never returned in an error string, never written to any artifact — not
even truncated.  ``client_email`` and ``project_id`` ARE surfaced on STDOUT on
purpose: the operator needs them to know which service account to grant GSC
access to.  They are NOT written to disk unmasked — this repository is PUBLIC
and both JSON artifacts are committed, so ``_redacted_for_disk`` masks the
address (``mas***@***.gserviceaccount.com``) and drops ``project_id`` at every
write of those two docs, including where the 403 reason string embeds the
address.  The in-memory doc keeps the full values for the printed summary.
