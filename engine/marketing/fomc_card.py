"""FOMC statement-diff card — the surface the analysis actually ships on.

WHY THE ANALYSIS IS ON A PICTURE. X gives a post 280 characters, and a 2-4
paragraph read of what the Committee changed is several thousand. The post body
therefore carries a hook and the card carries the argument, which is the same
division the earnings and breaking cards in this family already use. There are no
threads in v1: a thread is a different product with its own failure modes (a
dropped reply orphans the analysis) and the card is legible, quotable and one
fetch.

VISUAL FAMILY, NOT A LOOKALIKE. Every piece of chrome here is IMPORTED from
engine/marketing/chart_render.py — the favicon logomark, the brand bar, the
measured text width estimator, the wrapper, the escaper, the family palette. The
2026-07-26 incident in this repo was two lanes rendering their own lookalike cards
that drifted apart; the standing rule since is one seam, one renderer. What this
module owns is the LAYOUT of an FOMC diff, not a second visual language. The
candlestick machinery in that module is deliberately not touched.

CANVAS. 1080x1350 — the family's declared 4:5 tall variant, taken because a
statement diff plus three paragraphs of analysis genuinely warrants the extra
room. Every measurement is authored in 1080-space and scaled, so an off-size
caller degrades in proportion. Rastered at the family's scale=2 the body type
lands at ~62px on a 2160px-wide PNG, comfortably above what a phone timeline
needs and above the family's own 26px-in-1080-space legibility floor.

FAIL-SOFT. Returns a minimal valid SVG on any internal error, never raises. A
render that degrades costs the desk its analysis surface; a render that throws
would take down a wire tick.
