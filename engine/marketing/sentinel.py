"""engine.marketing.sentinel — Sentinel (trust_office) W1 plan-level gate.

De-escalate only: drop/quarantine/downgrade items; never originate or upgrade
content. Fully deterministic — no LLM anywhere in this module.

    write_report(root, report) -> Path
    reason_class(reason) -> "policy" | "overflow"

Reason classes: every quarantine reason is either
  * "overflow" — a capacity trim (daily/media/cashtag/slot caps). The content
    plan deliberately over-generates; the gate keeping the postable N is
    expected every night and needs no human attention.
  * "policy"   — a real ban-risk or content flag (lexicon, near-dup, shared
    media, disclosure, links, cherry-pick, stale receipts, disabled account).
    These are what the operator reviews.

# the same-day posted history of one account. They are deliberately lane-blind:
# the nightly plan, the wire lanes, the press bridge and an operator "post now"
# all land in one account's day, and only the last gate before the network sees
# all of them at once. See the "Post-time gates" section below for the
# functions, and scripts/marketing_publisher.py for the call sites.
#
# Per-account TEMPLATE-FRAME similarity. Two posts by one account on one day
# whose skeletons (tickers and numbers blanked) score at or above this are the
# same post wearing two tickers. Measured over the live outbox on 2026-07-29:
# 124 same-(account, day) pairs among approved/posted items, exactly ONE at or
# over 0.60 — flagship's "$PLTR into the week" / "$MSFT into the week" pair from
# 2026-07-25, at 0.778, which is precisely the defect. The next-highest pair

# "I post my results", so after the operator's review she shipped nothing. One a
# day per desk: they are seasoning, not a meal.
#
# THE PLAN SIDE HONOURS THE SAME NUMBER. content_studio.apply_reuse_budget reads
# this key too (see filler_budget_for) and trims the emitted day down to it, so
# this cap is a cross-lane BACKSTOP rather than a publish-time scythe through
# work the allocator planned. Without that, arming this at 1 would have
# quarantined 6 of flagship's 6 planned filler posts every night (measured on

    annotations to stdout for ramp config defects (missing created:, missing
    as_of, an unparseable tier value), at most once per process each.

    Mutation only ever de-escalates:
    - items may be quarantined (status → "quarantined", sentinel_ok → False)
    - passing items get sentinel_ok → True annotated
    - item type/headline/body are NEVER modified
    - no new items are originated

    Check sequencing (quarantine-aware — dead items consume no slots):
    1. Content-level checks (lexicon, disclosure, link rule, cashtag breadth)
       — item-intrinsic, order-independent. ALL hits are recorded, not just
       the first (the operator sees the full reason list).
    2. Always-enforced classes (account_disabled, stale-receipts refusal).
    3. Exceptions pass — restores eligible check-violations. Never restores
       an item carrying an always-enforced reason.
    4. Near-dup + shared-media across accounts, over items still alive after
       steps 1–3 (a pair with a dead side is not coordinated posting).
       First-alive-in-plan-order survives. If a near-dup survivor is later
       cap-killed in step 5 the dropped dup stays dropped — deliberate
       conservatism: near-identical content queued the same day is drop-worthy
       regardless (docket: "rewrite-or-drop the later item").
    5. Caps (daily, reply, same-cashtag, slot collision, media) counting ONLY
       still-alive items, in queue order. Check-then-commit: an item that
       fails any cap consumes NO slots at all.
    6. Final exceptions pass for step-4/5 violations (an operator allow may
       exceed a cap — human override by design). Net effect: an item with an
       allow-exception stays quarantined ONLY if it carries an always-enforced
       reason.
