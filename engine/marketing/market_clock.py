"""engine.marketing.market_clock — the honest temporal word for a marketing post.

WHY THIS EXISTS (operator defect report 2026-08-02, three classes shipped broken)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marketing copy stamps time words — "today", "overnight", "while New York slept",
"earnings land July 29" — from templates and from an LLM, and NOTHING in the
pipeline ever asked the exchange calendar whether those words were true. Three
classes went out or sat queued over the weekend of 2026-08-01/02:

  A. ``ob-2026-08-02-7fb823aecd`` (PUBLISHED Sunday 20:16Z, generated Sunday
     03:50Z): "While New York slept, one name kept running: / $MSFT +21.8% this
     week … That's a steepening slope, and earnings land July 29. 🍵"
     — an overnight frame on a day with no session on either side of the night,
     and a FUTURE-TENSE verb ("land") on a date four days in the past.
  B. ``ob-2026-08-01-a83c188711`` (generated Saturday 21:49Z): "$AMZN +15.3%
     today" — Friday's move called "today", on a Saturday.
  C. The "4 of 11 sectors green" family — six near-identical posts fanned across
     slots D1-S1/S5/S6/S10 in two weekend runs off ONE stale Friday breadth read.

Every one of those is a clock question, and there was no clock. Nine separate
sites had independently re-implemented ``weekday() >= 5`` (see the census in the
PR body) and not one of them was holiday-aware or fact-aware.

WHAT THIS MODULE IS
-------------------
ONE authority for three questions, used by BOTH generators and validators:

  * generators ask :func:`temporal_vocab` for the word they are allowed to
    stamp ("today" / "Friday" / "" ) and stamp that;
  * validators ask :func:`temporal_violations` which words already in a text are
    dishonest, and :func:`dead_date_future_tense` whether a past date is wearing
    a future-tense verb;
  * the fan-out gates ask :func:`lead_fact_keys` which source fact a post LEADS
    on, so one fact cannot wear six posts while a post that merely quotes a
    prior number to frame a new one still ships (:func:`fact_anchor_keys` is the
    whole-body form, kept for callers asking "what does this post touch").

The exchange calendar is NOT reimplemented here: :mod:`lib.nyse_calendar` is the
estate's existing authority (pure rule arithmetic, stdlib only, holidays + Good
Friday + one-off closures) and this module is a thin, marketing-shaped face over
it. It is imported LAZILY and guarded, because that module builds a ``ZoneInfo``
at import time and this one must survive a host with no tzdata: such a host
degrades to the weekend-only answer (wrong on the ~9 closure days a year, never
dead) — the same contract :func:`engine.marketing.hot_tape._is_session` states.

WEEKDAY AND MONTH NAMES ARE STATIC TUPLES, never ``strftime("%A")``/``("%B")``:
those are locale-sensitive and this is PUBLISHED COPY. Same reasoning, same
shape, as :data:`engine.marketing.intelligence_context._MONTHS_EN`.

FAIL DIRECTION. Every helper here is asked "may this post say X?", so the safe
error is to REFUSE. A clock that cannot resolve returns the conservative answer
(no "today", no "overnight"), never the permissive one — an unreadable calendar
must not become a licence to call Friday's tape "today".

Display-tier: no signal authority, no ledger writes. Callers own their gates.

# Session claims, and the freshness law over them
#
# THE OPERATOR, 2026-08-06: "we cannot keep posting stale content from the day
# before. you can post about tickers during market hours and after market closes
# anytime and say oh this went up or this went down, but you cant post yesterdays
# action today, or todays action tomorrow. no human would post stale data like
# that."
#
# THE MEASURED DEFECT. A `theme_list` planned for 2026-08-05T12:00Z reading
# "+1.9% avg on Tuesday" still offered an Approve button on Wednesday night —
# 35 hours old, one whole session past its own tape. Two siblings reached 60h.
# Every generation-time gate in the estate had passed it, correctly: "on Tuesday"
# was TRUE when it was written. The queue is what made it false, so only a
# publish-time gate can catch it — an item can be approved at any hour.
#
# WHY THIS LIVES HERE and not in the publisher. `publish_time_content` already
# resolves weekday / month-day / "today" phrases to session dates for ONE lane
# (its `_session_claims`), and the same question is now asked by the publisher
# for EVERY lane. A third copy of that resolver is how two gates start
# disagreeing about which session "on Friday" names. The resolver moves here,
# next to the calendar it depends on, and both callers ask the same function.
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

#: A weekday name as published copy writes it ("on Friday", "Friday's move").
#: CASE-SENSITIVE on the capitalised form: these are proper nouns in a headline,
#: and a case-insensitive match would be a needless invitation for a lower-case
#: false positive to kill a good post (the refusals downstream are terminal).
_WEEKDAY_CLAIM_RE = re.compile(
    r"(?<![\w'])(" + "|".join(_WEEKDAYS_EN) + r")(?![\w])")

#: "on July 31", "Aug 1" — the shape :func:`temporal_vocab` degrades to once a
#: weekday name would be ambiguous. Two deliberate narrowings:
#:   * a BARE month name is NOT matched. "May" is also an ordinary English word,
#:     and a month with no day number names no session anyway.
#:   * the alternation lists the FULL names and their 3-letter abbreviations
#:     EXPLICITLY, longest-first, instead of `Mar[a-z]*`-style prefixing. A
#:     wildcard suffix makes "Market 5" a March date, and a false positive here
#:     kills a good post.

    Two legs, and they catch different halves of the same law:

      ``stale_session:<fact>!=<live>`` — the item's own facts belong to a session
        that is no longer the live one. This is the 35h theme_list: its copy was
        internally consistent, and the thing that had changed was the clock.
      ``stale_session_claim:<claimed>!=<live>`` — the COPY names a session other
        than the live one, whatever the item's stamp says. This is the leg that
        survives a mis-stamped row.

    THE BOUNDARIES, each one a way this gate could have been worse than the
    defect (a gate that silences a lane is the failure mode of every previous
    attempt at this):

      * SAME-DAY AFTER-CLOSE SHIPS. :func:`live_session` spans the whole ET
        calendar day of a session, so a 21:00 ET post about that afternoon's
        close is current, not stale. The window closes when the NEXT session
        opens, exactly as the operator stated it.
      * A MISSING OR MALFORMED ``as_of`` IS NOT STALE. `fact_asof` that will not
        parse yields no fact session, and leg one simply does not run — a
        garbled stamp must never be the reason a good post dies. Leg two still
        applies, because it reads the copy rather than the stamp.
      * WEEKENDS AND HOLIDAYS SHIP. `live_session` walks back to Friday, so a
        Friday-stamped post published on Saturday is current all weekend and
        dies on Monday's open. That is the honest reading of "the next session
        kills it".
      * A POST THAT CLAIMS NO MARKET ACTION IS NOT JUDGED **BY LEG ONE**. An
        education post or a filing summary has no session to be stale about —
        and neither is any kind in :data:`NON_ACTION_KINDS`, whatever numbers
        its copy carries. LEG TWO STILL RUNS FOR EVERY KIND: it fires only when
        the copy NAMES a past session, which is a falsity in the words on the

# TWO SHAPES WERE VISIBLE IN THE OPERATOR'S SATURDAY OUTBOX and neither of the
# gates above could see them at DESK time — only at dispatch, which never came
# because the publisher was disarmed:
#
#   ob-2026-08-07-3358756700  theme_list  "Consumer Goods selling off, -2.4%
#                                          avg on Thursday"
#   ob-2026-08-08-ad8e39cb91  theme_list  "Commodities Metals ripping, +7.2%
#                                          avg today"
#
# The first one is HONEST COPY. "on Thursday" was true when it was written on
# Friday morning, `temporal_violations` has no opinion about a weekday name at
# all, and `stale_session_violations` leg 2 exempts it the moment the reader
# is on a weekend (Friday is still `live_session` all weekend, and Thursday is
# only ONE session back). It is nonetheless unpostable: a "what moved today"
# post that names a weekday is a same-day tape claim wearing yesterday's date.
#
# THE LAW, in two rules that share one home with the calendar above:
#
#   A. A SAME-DAY TAPE KIND MAY NOT NAME A WEEKDAY AT ALL. mover / theme_list
#      (and a `breaking` item off the live-tape lanes) exist to say "this is
#      what is moving RIGHT NOW". Their honest vocabulary is "today" plus the
#      TTL that retires them within hours; a day name in that copy is either
#      stale on its face or an invitation to read it as stale. Banned outright
#      rather than resolved-and-compared, because the resolution is exactly
#      what `_claim_is_cited` has to guess at and every guess it gets wrong
#      here ships the operator's complaint again.
#
#   B. A DAY WORD MUST MATCH THE POSTING CALENDAR DAY, FOR EVERY KIND.
#      "today"-class words name the session in progress (this restates
#      `temporal_vocab.allows_today` in calendar-day terms, which is why the
#      slug below is the SAME `today_word_off_session:` the ledger already
#      carries); "tonight" names the evening of the posting day; "yesterday"
#      names exactly one calendar day back from the item's own session.
#
# WHAT MUST KEEP PASSING. The weekend_levels watchlist lane writes "$NVDA into
# the week" — no day name, no day word, a forward frame about a session that
# has not happened. It carries no violation under either rule and it must not
# acquire one; that is the fixture this section is tested against.
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

#: Abbreviations published copy actually uses ("Fri close", "Thu tape").
#:
#: SAT AND SUN ARE DELIBERATELY ABSENT. Matching is case-insensitive — a desk
#: writes "Fri" and a headline writes "FRI" — and "sat" and "sun" are ordinary
#: English words ("the stock sat at 40", "sun-belt names"). A false positive
#: here is a terminal quarantine, so an abbreviation earns its place only when

#
# MEASURED on the live corpus: ONE fact — 203k jobless claims, 8.6% below a year
# ago, 5.0% GDPNow, 2.1% median CPI — was generated on FIVE days across SEVEN
# accounts and TWO of them POSTED. Every text-similarity gate in the estate saw
# seven different strings, because they ARE seven different strings:
#
#   "203k claims a week this month, 8.6% below a year ago"          (posted)
#   "Jobless claims averaging 203k this month, 8.6% below…"          (posted)
#   "claims hit 203k this month, 8.6% below a year ago"
#   "203k jobless claims, 5.0% GDPNow, 2.1% median CPI"
#   "Jobless claims: 203 thousand a week, 8.6% below a year ago"
#
# And `fact_anchor_keys` above could not see them either: its two key families
# are RATIOS over a named universe and a single-ticker PERCENT. A weekly macro
# print is neither, so it was invisible to the one gate built for exactly this.
#
# THE LAW: a numeric fact posts once per cooldown window, NETWORK-WIDE,
# fingerprinted on (indicator, VALUE). The value half is what keeps this from
# being a mute button: GDPNow moving 5.0 -> 5.9 is NEWS and ships, while the
# same 203k reworded for a fourth desk does not. Both live in the corpus on the
# same night, and a key on the indicator alone would have killed the new print.

#: Canonical indicator slug -> the ways copy names it. Aliases collapse into one
#: slug because the desks genuinely rotate through them: "GDPNow", "the Atlanta
#: Fed", and a bare "Growth:" label are three names for one number, and keying
#: them apart is how three phrasings of one print all read as fresh.
#: THE PER-WEEK COUNT IDIOM (correction C1, 2026-08-06). A desk does not always
#: write the indicator's name: ob-2026-08-04-45e4653200 opens "203 thousand a
#: week this month, 8.6% below a year ago." and names no indicator at all in its
#: first line. That cost nothing while an unkeyed lead meant "exempt", and it
#: became the whole defect the moment C1 made the cooldown fall back to the
#: earliest keyable claim ANYWHERE in the body: the fallback then keyed the post
#: on the 5.0% GDPNow print sitting on line TWO as framing, and that mis-key
#: propagated — the post owned ``macro:gdpnow:5pct`` for seven days and took
#: down three unrelated 08-06 posts, including ob-2026-08-06-33dbf95911, whose
#: subject is narrow leadership and which quotes 5% only to frame it. Measured:
#: `event` went 1/2 -> 0/2 on today's plan, a lane at zero, on a number no post
#: involved was actually about.
#:
#: A COUNT IN THOUSANDS QUOTED PER WEEK IS THE WEEKLY CLAIMS PRINT. Nothing else
#: in this domain is published that way, which is why the idiom can carry the
#: indicator's name on its own. The lookbehind is what keeps it that narrow: the
#: phrase only counts as a name when it directly follows a `k`/`thousand` value,
#: so an ordinary "up 2% a week" never becomes a claims print.

    would let two desks writing about two different names collide on
    ``macro:gdpnow:12pct`` — a terminal quarantine earned by a coincidence. Every
    post in the measured 203k family is cashtag-free, because a macro print is
    not about a ticker; requiring that costs the gate nothing real and closes the
    whole false-positive class. :data:`_COMPANY_SCOPE_RE` closes the half of it
    that names the company in words instead of a cashtag.

    A number takes ONE indicator name, and which one is decided in this order:

      1. the name has to be quoted in the value's UNIT (:data:`_MACRO_UNITS`) —
         GDPNow is never 203 thousand;
      2. names in the same CLAUSE beat names across a comma or a full stop

    ONE NAME, NOT ALL OF THEM. Pairing every name in range was the first cut and
    it manufactured a cross product — "203k claims … 2.1% median CPI" emitted
    ``macro:cpi:203k`` and ``macro:claims:2.1pct`` as well as the two real keys,
    so an unrelated post quoting 2.1% claims would have collided with it.

    THE THREE SHAPES THAT HAVE TO WORK, all live in the corpus and all pinned:
    ``"203k jobless claims"`` (value first), ``"GDPNow has growth at 5.9%"``
    (name first), ``"Growth: 5.9%"`` (label). A plain symmetric gap got the first
    one wrong — it handed "2.1% median CPI" to the GDPNow two characters behind
    it — which is how one 2.1% CPI print ended up on two keys that could never
    collide, the exact dedup failure this fingerprint exists to fix.

def lead_fact_keys(text: str, kind: str = "") -> frozenset[str]:
    """The post's LEAD fact, as anchor keys. The cooldown's unit (ruling R1).

    THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR (round-1 review, 2026-08-06). The fan-out gate
    read :func:`fact_anchor_keys` over the WHOLE body and refused on the first
    key any live sibling owned, so a post whose lead fact was brand new but
    which also recited last week's numbers as framing died whole. Measured on
    the live outbox that night: macro 0/6 survivors, event 0/2, mover 0/2, and
    BOTH carriers of the genuinely new 5.0 -> 5.9 GDPNow print refused — one on
    ``macro:claims:203k`` owned by a post four days older. Zero posts carrying
    the new number reached the network, which is the precise opposite of the law
    the fingerprint was built to serve ("a NEW number is news and ships").

    THE RULE. The cooldown keys the LEAD fact — the first numeric claim in the
    post, which is the one in the headline when the headline carries one.
    Supporting numbers later in the body are CONTEXT: they neither trigger the
    cooldown nor claim an anchor of their own. "GDPNow 5.9%, up from 5.0% last
    week" is what a human analyst writes and it ships; a post whose LEAD is the
    same 203k that shipped on 08-02 does not. The defect the operator reported
    was never a post that mentioned a number, it was the same number being the
    WHOLE post, five days running.

    SYMMETRIC BY CONSTRUCTION. Ownership is claimed on the same keys refusal is
    tested against, so a post that merely cites 203k in its third line cannot
    quietly claim that anchor and starve the post whose lead it actually is.

    CORRECTION C1 (operator 2026-08-06, after the round-2 review): AN EMPTY LEAD
    LINE MEANS "LOOK FURTHER", NEVER "EXEMPT". The first cut of this function
    returned ``frozenset()`` whenever the first non-empty line carried no keyable
    number, and both callers read an empty set as "cannot judge, let it through"
    — so a post whose opening line is prose was exempt from the cooldown
    ENTIRELY. The reviewer built and verified it: "Here is what the labor market
    looks like right now / Jobless claims 203k a week, 8.6% below a year ago.
    The Atlanta Fed has growth at 5.0% this quarter." keyed NOTHING and shipped
    against any number of siblings, and 40 of the 180 corpus items carrying a
    whole-body key carried none. Live, it was the operator's own defect walking
    through the gate: ob-2026-08-04-45e4653200 leads on the 203k print itself.

    So the lead FACT is the EARLIEST keyable claim in the body. A post with
    numbers is always judged on some claim; only a post with no keyable number
    at all yields an empty set, and that is the honest "nothing to judge".

    AND THAT IS ONE RULE, NOT TWO. The first cut of this correction kept a
    `lead_segment` filter (the first non-empty line) and fell back to the whole
    body only when that came up empty. That span is by definition the LOWEST
    offset in the text, so "prefer the lead line, else look further" and "take
    the earliest claim in the body" agree on every possible input — the filter
    was dead code no mutation could reach (verified: swapping the filtered scope
    for the whole body left every marketing test green). The rule is therefore
    stated once, where a mutation can pin it. The ruling's protection is
    unharmed: "GDPNow 5.9%, up from 5.0% last week" still keys the 5.9% alone,
    because the 5.9% comes first.
