"""engine.marketing.weekend_levels — popular-ticker "levels into the week" posts.

WHY THIS EXISTS
The signal lane (content_studio) sources posts from the Prophet plan pool, which
(a) ages out — most plans exceed the 21-day postable window, so on a quiet week
`postable_signals` can return almost nothing — and (b) skews to mid-caps. On a
weekend, markets are closed and there are no fresh signals or same-day movers to
post at all. That is exactly when the account most needs reach content: people
search the cashtags of the stocks THEY hold ($NVDA, $TSLA, $AAPL…) over the
weekend to see what the tape is saying, and there is far less competition on
those hashtags than on a weekday.

This module fills that gap with an evergreen, drought-proof lane: for a curated
set of the most-searched tickers it reads Friday's close (EOD OHLCV) and writes a
short, honest "here's where it sits into the week" WATCHLIST post — levels and
observations, never a buy/sell call. It needs no Prophet plan and no live tape,
so it works every weekend regardless of signal supply.

COMPLIANCE
Emitted as kind="watchlist", which the Sentinel does NOT require a disclosure on
(disclosure law is signal-only, sentinel.py §disclosure). Copy is generated from
level facts with no financial-advice lexicon and exactly one cashtag per post, so
it clears the plan-level gate. `_assert_clean` enforces this at build time.

DISPLAY-TIER, NO AUTHORITY. This never scores, ranks, or escalates anything; it
is a presentation of public price levels. The publisher's live tape gate still
re-verifies every item before it posts (and post-#3466 posts level kinds against
the last close on weekends).

# VOICE (2026-07-26 incident fix). The first version of this lane was ONE
# f-string skeleton — "Closed {px}, {week}, {trend}. {position}. Into next week,
# {level}. {tail}" — so eight consecutive flagship posts were the same sentence
# with the numbers swapped, each stacking three raw technical clauses (the 20-,
# the 50-, % off highs, range position). It read exactly like what it was: a bot.
#
# Two changes:
#  1. The LLM copywriter is now the PRIMARY writer for this lane (write_copy →
#     copywriter.write_posts_llm_v2, the same per-post persona/voice lane
#     content_studio uses). This lane used to be the one queue that never
#     touched it, and until 2026-07-31 it was still on the RETIRED v1 batch
#     entry point, whose documented failure mode is a silent 100% template
#     fallback.
#  2. Everything below is now only the DETERMINISTIC FLOOR for when NOBODY ARMED
#     THE WRITER (no config flag, no MARKETING_LLM_ENABLED) — an armed lane that
#     produces no model copy DROPS the post instead, because `watchlist` is a
#     planned kind and the no-fallback law covers it. Even the floor obeys the
#     design doctrine: lead with the plain state, name at most ONE level, vary
#     the sentence shape per state so a run of posts does not share a skeleton.

# THE ROTATED TAIL, v5 (voice doctrine, 2026-08-11). This tuple shipped
#     "On the watch list, not a call." / "Watching, no position." /
#     "On the radar, tracking it, not touching it." / "Levels, not advice."
# and it welded one of those four onto the end of EVERY weekend post. Two of
# them are named in the doctrine's kill list by exact string ("Watching, no
# position", "Levels, not advice") and `copywriter.voice_v5_violations` now
# rejects both plus the "not advice" family outright, so the whole rotation had
# to go: a confession or a disclaimer is not a read, and this lane was ending
# every post on one. "On the radar, tracking it, not touching it" additionally
# trips `copywriter.uncomputed_stance` today (trade decision 'touching' inside a
# prescriptive frame), so the old tuple could not clear the gate it stands in
# for either.
#
# The replacement carries what a weekend post actually knows: the levels are
# drawn from the name's own weekly bars, they are re-drawn next weekend, and the
# next week is what grades them. No em dashes (copywriter.validate_copy rejects
# U+2014 as a model tell), no first person, no question marks.

# Per-state sentence shapes for the deterministic floor. Each state gets its own
# opener AND its own read, so a weekend run (which spans several states) does not
# read as one template. {wk}=week clause, {s20}/{s50}/{lo}=levels, {px}=close.
# One level per post: the doctrine demotes technicals, and a post that names the
# 20-, the 50-, the high and the range position is a data dump, not a read. THE
# EXECUTABLE FORM IS A SUBSTRING COUNT — a rendered body may contain "-day" AT
# MOST ONCE (tests/test_marketing_card_parity.py::
# test_floor_copy_names_at_most_one_moving_average), so a frame that needs to
# mention the other average says "the longer line" / "both moving averages" and
# prints only the cited level's number. The v5 rewrite tripped this in 12 of 36
# frames on the first pass; it is cheap to breach and invisible until rendered.
# SIX shapes per state, not two. A weekend batch is NOT evenly spread across
# states: market moves correlate, so a down week puts five of eight names in
# "downtrend" and they all draw from the same small pool. With two frames that
# produced literal twins ($AMZN and $META shipped the same sentence with
# different numbers). Six shapes plus the per-state spread in build_items means
# a run has to reach seven names in ONE state before any shape repeats.
#
# No frame may open with the words a headline in the same state uses, or the two
# halves stutter ("$MSFT is still heavy" over "Still heavy, down 3%...").
#
# VOICE DOCTRINE v5 (2026-08-11) — WHAT THE 36 LINES BELOW WERE REWRITTEN FROM.
# Every frame used to put the AUTHOR in the sentence: "Nothing broken here, and
# I'd rather respect that than argue with it", "Good for anyone already in; I'm
# not paying up here", "{s20} is the level I want reclaimed", "I have seen plenty
# of these fail at the next line". That is a persona performing a reaction to a
# trade, and measured across the live queue it was 25.8% of the corpus — the
# single biggest thing v5 deletes. THE READ IS IN THE SELECTION, NOT IN A
# PERFORMED REACTION: this lane already decided which fifteen tickers are worth a
# weekend post, and that decision is the opinion. The sentence's job is to say
# what the TAPE did.
#
# So every frame now obeys three rules on top of the two above:
#   * **The subject is the market.** No I / I'm / I'd / my / we / our. Price,
#     the trend, the average, the range — those are the subjects.
#   * **No questions, no exclamation marks, no advice imperatives.** Not
#     "watch {s20}", not "get back over {s20}"; the level is stated as a fact and
#     the reader draws the consequence. `copywriter.uncomputed_stance` is the
#     executable half of this and every line below is screened through it.
#   * **The invalidation is a fact about the LEVEL, not about trust.** "Below
#     {s20} the near-term trend is the first thing gone", never "I trust it only
#     above {s20}".
# Placeholders per index are UNCHANGED from the v4 bank (the {wk}/{wk_cap}
# alternation and the state's cited level), because `cited_level` pairs the state
# with the line the card actually draws and tests pin that pairing.

    (headline); the body carries the substance so the post never reads like a
    cashtag-stuffed bot.

    BOTH halves vary by the ticker's structural state, so a weekend run differs
    in its headline, its sentence shape and its numbers rather than only the
    last. Falls back to the legacy single-frame body only if the state-specific
    frame would breach the X limit.

    variant:       position in the batch. Rotates the tail, so the sign-off
                   varies down the feed regardless of state.
    state_variant: how many EARLIER posts in this batch share this state.
                   Selects the headline and body shape, so five downtrend names
                   in one run take five different shapes instead of colliding on
                   `variant % len(pool)`. Defaults to `variant` for callers that

    MIGRATED OFF THE v1 BATCH WRITER (X Growth W1g, 2026-07-31). This lane called
    `copywriter.write_posts_llm`, the retired batch path whose documented failure
    mode is a SILENT 100% template fallback: it asks one model call for the whole
    batch as a single JSON array, and when that reply truncates or fails to parse
    the function returns None and every post silently reverts to template prose
    (copywriter.py, `write_posts_llm`). That is the exact incident the
    Content Studio wave was built to end — a persona lane armed, credentialed,
    and producing not one live post. `write_posts_llm_v2` calls per post, so one
    bad reply costs one post, and it DROPS rather than templating.

    WHY DROP AND NOT FALL BACK TO THE FLOOR. `watchlist` is a planned kind and
    the no-fallback law (masterplan §0 gate 1) covers it: a planned post whose
    model copy fails is dropped and counted. The floor copy is good prose, but it
    is still template prose, and the whole point of the wave is that the reader
    stops meeting it. The floor keeps exactly one job — being what ships when
    nobody armed the writer at all (`lane_armed` above) — plus its old job of
    seeding the writer's context.

    WEEKEND SEMANTICS SURVIVE THE MOVE. Contexts are still built from level facts
    with `type="watchlist"`, so the post stays an evergreen levels read with no
    "today" claim, and `_assert_clean` still runs on whatever the model returns.

    The PROVIDER WATERFALL is the copywriter's, and deliberately so: the whole
    `copywriter` block (its `llm` sub-block included) is handed to the writer, so
    weekend levels inherits the marketing-copywriter lane's ChatGPT-first routing
    (codex/Sol leading, the key_pool-balanced Claude oauth rung behind it —
    operator directive 2026-07-29) with no second copy of those keys to drift.

    The idempotence read. Fail-soft: an unreadable queue answers 0, because a

    STATUS-BLIND ON PURPOSE (defect closed 2026-07-31; the incident it replays is
    2026-07-26). This used to call `rewrite.live_items_for`, which filters out
    every TERMINAL status — and `posted` is terminal. So the guard could only see
    a batch that had not shipped yet: the 03:13 batch of eight queued, POSTED
    through the morning, and by the 09:52 rerun every one of its rows was
    invisible to this check. The lane read "nothing built for 2026-07-26",
    rebuilt the whole day, and produced a second contradictory post per slot —
    eight more Chrome rasters and eight more R2 uploads against a render budget
    that is law. An idempotence guard that goes blind the moment its work
    SUCCEEDS is the exact inverse of the guarantee it advertises: the better the
    lane performs, the sooner it duplicates itself.

    "Built" therefore means ANY row for this (account, as_of, provenance) triple
    in items.jsonl, whatever the ledger later did to it — posted, quarantined,
    failed, recalled, superseded. The row is the receipt that the work was done.

    WHAT THIS COSTS, stated plainly: quarantining a bad batch no longer re-arms
    the lane for the same day (the old docstring named that as the recovery path
    and it is now gone). That is the correct trade — a duplicate slate on a live
    timeline is a public contradiction, while a day with a quarantined batch and
    no replacement is merely a quiet day. Re-running a day on purpose is an
    operator action: supersede the rows through `engine.marketing.rewrite`

    schedule: optional list of (slot_label, scheduled_at_iso) assigned in order;
    when omitted, items are scheduled "immediate" with no slot (caller schedules).
    cfg: parsed config/marketing.yml — enables the LLM voice lane (write_copy).
         Without it the deterministic floor copy ships.
    with_media: render + attach the v2 chart card per post (default on). Set
         False in tests to skip chart rendering entirely.
    skip_if_queued: return [] when this lane already has a live item for
         (account, as_of). The REWRITE path passes False — it exists precisely
         to regenerate copy for items that are already queued, and supersedes
         them one for one (engine.marketing.rewrite.apply_rewrite).

    Returns at most *max_items* items, one per ticker that has usable data and
    compliant copy. Never raises — a bad ticker is skipped with a warning.

    IDEMPOTENT BY DEFAULT (2026-07-26 double slate). This lane ran twice for
    as_of=2026-07-26 — a 03:13 batch and a 09:52 batch — and produced EIGHT
    items each time: a second, contradictory post for every slot, which the
    operator deleted by hand. The downstream `supersede_lane` retirement added
    later still lets the second run render eight fresh chart cards and write
    eight rows before retiring the first eight, so a re-run costs eight Chrome
    rasters and eight R2 uploads against a render budget that is law. Detecting
    the day up front is cheaper and is what "never duplicate" actually means.
    A PARTIAL first run is deliberately treated as built: this returns [] when
    ANY item exists for the day. Refilling the rest of a ladder needs slot
    occupancy this function does not have, and the day-cap is the real limiter
    anyway.

    "ANY item" is STATUS-BLIND — including a batch that already posted. See
    `already_built` for why the old live-items-only read let a shipped 03:13
    batch look like an empty day at 09:52, and for the recovery path that
    replaces "quarantine it to re-arm the lane".
