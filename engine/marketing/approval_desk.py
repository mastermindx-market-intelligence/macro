"""engine/marketing/approval_desk.py — the AUTONOMOUS APPROVAL DESK.

THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. The planned kinds (signal, chart, education, macro,
receipt, watchlist, event, congress, insider) have had NO functioning path to
live. The designed path was operator approval: the admin UI writes an
approve/hold row to `data/marketing/outbox/decisions.jsonl`, and
`outbox.apply_decisions` turns an `approve` into a `queued → approved`
transition. That file has ZERO rows in repo history. Every planned post that
ever reached X was hand-transitioned by an agent session. Meanwhile
`publish.auto_approve_scope: kinds` deliberately confines the publisher's
auto-approve pass to the publish-time lane (`provenance:
publisher_live_movers`), so the nightly desk writes into a queue that nothing
drains.

The operator's standing instruction is the specification, verbatim: "closely
audit them, then approve them so they go out quickly without me". This module
is that sentence as a machine gate — a set of NAMED checks, each of which can
be pointed at afterwards, that either clears an item to `approved`, kills it to
`quarantined` with the evidence in the note, or LEAVES IT ALONE for a human.

THE THREE VERDICTS, AND WHY THE THIRD ONE EXISTS.

  * every check passes                → `queued → approved`, actor
    `approval-desk`, note listing the checks that passed. The publisher's own
    dispatch gates (live tape, cap, cadence, chart law, near-dup, voice) all
    still run afterwards; this desk is an ADDITIONAL bar, never a bypass.
  * a HARD FAIL                       → `queued → quarantined` with
    `approval-desk: <check>: <one-line evidence>`. Terminal, on purpose: the
    named failures are all "this post asserts something the desk cannot stand
    behind", and a post that invents a level does not get better by waiting.
  * UNVERIFIABLE                      → under the DECISIVE posture (default,
    operator order 2026-08-08) `queued → quarantined` with
    `approval-desk: <check>: decisive posture (approval_desk.decisive): …`.
    With `decisive: false` it reverts to the original third verdict: nothing at
    all, the item stays `queued` and is counted as held for human review.

WHY THE THIRD VERDICT WAS RETIRED. It was the original safety argument —
autonomy that approves what it cannot verify is worse than no autonomy — and
measured against the operator's real queue it bought nothing and cost the whole
program: "36 posts in outbox … i don't want to review so many posts per day …
need a system that doesn't require my manual review all the time." A held item
is not reviewed; it rots, holds its fact anchor, and vetoes tonight's copy
through the near-dup corpus. The safety half is unchanged — the desk still never
APPROVES what it cannot verify — and the audit trail is unchanged, because a
quarantine carries the check name and the evidence into the admin view. What
changed is that nothing waits on a human. Audit after, never approve before.

A `hold` still exists and is NOT a human queue: see `MACHINE_DEFERRALS`. It
means another machine owns the heal (the media backfill lane) or that the desk
itself crashed, and both are bounded by the 36h liveness bar.

WHAT THE DESK DELIBERATELY DOES NOT TOUCH.
  * `breaking` — it already has a working all-gates-passed path (the press /
    hot-tape immediate rail plus `--post-now`), and its TTL is measured in
    minutes; a desk that audits it would only slow it down.
  * `mover` / `theme_list` — kind-scoped auto-approve already clears these
    (`publish.auto_approve_kinds` + the publish-time lane), and they are
    generated seconds before dispatch from live quotes.
  * `wire`, `earnings`, `reply`, `news` — their lanes own their own admission.
  * anything a human has decided on. See `_human_has_spoken`.

CONFIG (`config/marketing.yml`, block `approval_desk`). `enabled` ships TRUE:
the operator asked for the autonomy explicitly, so the kill switch is the
config line, not the default. Everything else is a bound, not a feature flag.

Fail-soft throughout, at the item AND the sweep level: an exception while
auditing one item leaves that item queued (the conservative verdict) and the
sweep continues; an exception in the sweep leaves the whole queue untouched.
A desk that crashes must degrade to the pre-desk world (nothing gets approved),
never to an unaudited approval.

# Config
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

#: The kinds this desk polices. The nine planned kinds — i.e. everything
#: `outbox.planned_kinds()` returns — because every one of them was written by
#: the nightly content plan into a queue with no drain.
#:
#: `education` IS here. The build brief's prose list names eight kinds and omits
#: it, but its own acceptance gate requires "the zero-payload education shape"
#: to quarantine by name, and an item of a kind the desk skips can never
#: quarantine at all. Education is also the kind that PRODUCED the zero-payload
#: defect ("Macro without the jargon", "The discipline a watch list enforces" —
#: bare template stems with no fact in them, five of the twelve value-gate
#: abstentions in the 154-emission corpus). Skipping it would exempt the exact
#: shape this desk exists to catch.
_DESK_KINDS_DEFAULT: tuple[str, ...] = (
    "signal", "chart", "education", "macro", "receipt",
    "watchlist", "event", "congress", "insider",
)

#: Per-sweep approval ceiling. NOT a rate limit on quality — a trickle valve.
#: A night where the nightly emits ~200 planned items across seven desks (the
#: measured plan size is 218) and every one of them clears would otherwise hand
#: the dispatch loop a 200-item approved backlog in a single sweep. The per
#: account daily cap and the global spacing floor would then meter it out over
#: days, which means the queue's ORDER decides what ships and the freshest
#: reads sit behind the stalest ones. Approving 40 per sweep against a ~30
#: sweep day keeps the approved pool roughly the size the dispatch lane can
#: actually drain, and the overflow is re-audited next sweep against fresher
#: evidence rather than sitting pre-blessed.
_MAX_APPROVALS_DEFAULT = 40

#: Same-account near-dup bar for the desk's own dedup check, per the build
#: brief. DELIBERATELY LOOSER than the publisher's post-time near-dup gate
#: (`outbox._NEAR_DUP_JACCARD` = 0.7), which still runs on every item this desk
#: approves. Two gates, two jobs: at 0.85 the desk refuses to APPROVE only the
#: obvious repeats (a post that is textually the same story as one sent this
#: week), and the tighter 0.7 gate remains the last word before the network.
#: Setting the desk to 0.7 would just move the same quarantine earlier and
#: strip the post-time gate of anything to do.
_DEDUP_JACCARD_DEFAULT = 0.85

#: Max |target / quoted price - 1| a swing-horizon post may print, in percent.
#:
#: EVERY KIND THIS DESK POLICES IS SWING-HORIZON. The house horizon is 2-4 weeks
#: (see the backtest horizon law); the intraday kinds — mover, theme_list,
#: breaking — are all explicitly out of the desk's scope, so there is no
#: horizon to branch on and the bound applies to every target the desk sees.
#: 35% over 2-4 weeks is already an extraordinary claim for a large-cap swing
#: read; past it the number is almost always a chart fact (a 52-week high, a
#: prior cycle peak) that the writer promoted into a price objective.
_MAX_TARGET_MOVE_PCT_DEFAULT = 35.0

#: Liveness TTL. Defaults to `outbox._STALE_QUEUED_HOURS` (36h) so the desk's
#: bar and the nightly reaper's bar are ONE number by default — see
#: `check_liveness` for the division of labour between them.
_TTL_HOURS_DEFAULT = 36.0

#: DECISIVE POSTURE (operator order 2026-08-08): "i don't want to review so many
#: posts per day ... need a system that doesn't require my manual review all the
#: time."
#:
#: The third verdict — leave it queued for a human — was the safety argument
#: this desk shipped with, and measured against the operator's actual queue it
#: is the DEFECT: 36 items sat waiting for a review that is never coming, which
#: is strictly worse than either deciding them or killing them, because a held
#: item still rots, still holds its fact anchor, and still vetoes tonight's copy
#: through the near-dup corpus.
#:
#: Decisive flips ONE class, not all three. `UNVERIFIABLE` ("I have nothing to
#: look at") becomes a quarantine with the check's own evidence in the note; the
#: desk still never approves what it cannot verify, it just stops parking it on
#: a human. `HOLD` is untouched, because a hold here is not a request for review
#: at all: see :data:`MACHINE_DEFERRALS`.
_DECISIVE_DEFAULT = True

#: The hold classes that survive `decisive`, and WHY each one is not a human
#: bottleneck. Every other route to `hold` is gone under the decisive posture.
#:
#:   ``chart_law``   another MACHINE owns the heal —
#:                   `scripts/marketing_media_backfill.py` resolves the R2 URL
#:                   hours later, and `check_liveness` retires the item at 36h
#:                   if it never does. Quarantining here would destroy a good
#:                   post the backfill was about to fix, terminally.
#:   ``audit_error`` the desk's own exception path. A crash proves nothing about
#:                   the ITEM, so converting our bug into a terminal verdict on
#:                   somebody's copy is the one conversion that would be worse
#:                   than the wait. It is bounded by the same 36h liveness bar.

        ONLY `provenance == content_studio` and only at NIGHTLY EMIT time. The
        desk's sweep runs it too (see `run`), which is itself the first half of
        the gap: nothing ran it during the trading day.
      * `outbox.expire_stale_wire` (3h/12h by kind) covers the fast lanes'

        desk's scope.
      * NEITHER covers a planned-kind item from any OTHER provenance. The

    provenance gets its first and only liveness check right here.

    A per-kind TTL is honoured when configured (`ttl_hours_by_kind`), and ships
    EMPTY: the desk's default bar is exactly the reaper's 36h, so nothing about
    liveness changes for a covered item until an operator says otherwise. A
    kind TTL is only meaningful when it is STRICTER, since the reaper has
    already taken anything past 36h in the covered set.

    THE TWO DAY-WORD CHECKS SIT SECOND AND THIRD, directly behind `payload`, for
    the same reason the publisher puts its clock gate ahead of the language and
    voice gates: FALSITY OUTRANKS STYLE, and the operator reads these names. A
    Saturday theme_list reading "+7.2% avg today" is also number-heavy and
    dedup-adjacent; the reason recorded should be the day, because the day is
    the defect.

    RESOLUTION: any hard fail → quarantine. Else, under the decisive posture,
    any UNVERIFIABLE → quarantine with the check's evidence. Else any remaining
    hold → leave queued (only :data:`MACHINE_DEFERRALS` can reach this). Else →
    approve.
