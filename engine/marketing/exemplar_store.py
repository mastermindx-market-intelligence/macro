"""engine/marketing/exemplar_store.py — the OPERATOR-RATIFIED exemplar store (E3).

Masterplan §10 E3: "auto-distilled exemplar candidates -> **operator-ratified**
exemplar store versions -> writer/critic prompts load exemplars from the store
(config-pinned version, never auto-flipped)".

    harvester  ->  propose_candidates()  ->  PENDING pool   (automatic, cheap)
                                                  |
                                    promote_pending()       (OPERATOR act #1)
                                                  v
                                            a numbered VERSION
                                                  |
                            config: intel.exemplar_store.active_version = N
                                                  |                (OPERATOR act #2)
                                                  v
                                  active_exemplars(register, k)  ->  the writer

**TWO OPERATOR ACTS, ON PURPOSE.** Minting a version and ACTIVATING one are
separate. ``promote_pending`` writes a new numbered version into the store and
changes nothing about what the writer sees; the writer sees exactly the version
pinned in ``config/marketing.yml`` ``intel.exemplar_store.active_version``, which
only a config edit (a reviewable diff on a tracked file) can move. So a promotion
cannot flip house voice, and a rollback is `git revert` on one config line.

**NOTHING HERE IS AUTOMATIC ABOVE THE PENDING POOL.** The harvester may append
candidates all night. It cannot promote, and it cannot activate. An unpinned
store means the writer sees NO exemplars — dark by default, which is the correct
launch state for a mechanism that changes how every desk sounds.

**The candidates are ranked deterministically** (interaction rate over observed
counters). An LLM may later *distil style notes* from a ratified version; it may
not choose which posts get in, and it may not score them (LLM-never-scores law).

    """The store, fail-soft. A missing/torn/foreign-schema file reads as EMPTY.

    Empty is the safe read: an empty store has no versions, so ``pinned_version``
    resolves to nothing and the writer gets zero exemplars. A corrupt store
    therefore degrades to "no exemplars", never to "some other version's voice".

    SCHEMA IS CHECKED ON READ, and it has to be, because ``save_store`` stamps
    ``STORE_SCHEMA`` unconditionally on whatever dict it is handed. Adopting a
    blob wholesale and then re-stamping it relabels a store written under a
    different (older, or another tool's) schema as current — silently, on the
    next write, with the entry shape assumed rather than verified. Since the
    entries feed the WRITER PROMPT, a mislabelled store is a voice change nobody
    approved. A schema mismatch is announced at line start and treated as empty.

    THE CONTAINER SHAPES ARE CHECKED TOO (MY-M7). A truncated write leaves invalid
    JSON and is caught above, but the other torn shape parses cleanly: ``versions``
    arriving as a string, or as a list with a non-dict in it. That blob passed
    every check here and then made ``active_exemplars`` raise ``AttributeError``
    deep in a comprehension — inside the WRITER's prompt build. Both callers wrap
    the hook, so the post still shipped, but the module's own contract ("returns
    [], never raises") was false and the failure was reported as a caller warning
    rather than a store problem. A malformed container is now the same answer as a
    malformed schema: EMPTY, announced at line start.

    """THE WRITER HOOK. Exemplars from the PINNED version only.

    WIRED IN PRODUCTION (E-wave review, BLOCKER 3 — this shipped with no caller
    at all, so the whole harvest -> pending -> promotion -> pin chain ended at a
    function only tests ran). The two callers, both of which pass ``cfg`` and
    ``root`` down and add nothing to any numeric whitelist:

        engine/marketing/copywriter.py   store_exemplar_block()
                                         -> _v2_system_prompt -> write_posts_llm_v2
        engine/marketing/reply_voice.py  system_prompt()
                                         -> voice_or_fallback

    The dependency still points ONE WAY: this module imports neither of them.

        from engine.marketing import exemplar_store
        shots = exemplar_store.active_exemplars(register, k=4, cfg=cfg)
        # each: {register, text, author, url, shape, engagement, ...}
        # -> render into the writer prompt as verbatim style references.
        # STYLE ONLY: the figures inside an exemplar are somebody else's, and
        # must never widen the item's own numbers_whitelist.

    Guarantees the caller can rely on:
      * an UNPINNED store returns ``[]`` (dark default) — never "the latest";
      * a pin at a version the store does not have returns ``[]`` — never a
        neighbouring version;
      * the pending pool is NEVER visible here, however full it is;
      * the order is deterministic (interaction rate, then post id), so the same
        corpus and the same pin build the same prompt;
      * IT NEVER RAISES (MY-M7). This runs inside the writer's prompt build, and
        a store the operator hand-edited (or a half-written one) must cost the
        prompt its exemplars, never the post. ``load_store`` screens the container
        shapes; the umbrella below covers a malformed ENTRY (a version row whose
        ``version`` is not a number, an ``entries`` list of strings, an
        ``engagement`` value that will not float) that no reader can anticipate.
