"""engine.marketing.source_authority — a citation must EARN its place in the post.

OPERATOR LAW, 2026-08-04: "Reduce the citing unless it's a popular news outlet
that can help to give us authority. We shouldn't be citing some random site like
ForexLive or citing other X accounts. But we can say WSJ, Reuters, NYT... We gain
when we cite from big shots, we gain nothing and even lose prestige by citing
places no one knows about."

WHAT WAS THERE BEFORE, AND WHY IT WAS WRONG. Every single-source item got the
string ``-- wire reports`` (press_corroboration._WIRE_CREDIT), written on
2026-08-02 to stop an X relay shipping ``-- @FirstSquawk reporting``. That fix
solved de-branding by ANONYMISING, and anonymising has two costs nobody priced:

  * "wire" is not a publication. There is no masthead called Wire. A reader
    parses "-- wire reports" as a source they have never heard of, which is the
    exact prestige loss the credit was supposed to avoid — now attached to EVERY
    item, including the ones we could have credited to Reuters.
  * It is applied by CORROBORATION COUNT, not by who the source is. A Reuters
    exclusive and a no-name blog relay get the identical anonymous clause.

THE REPLACEMENT is two orthogonal questions, decided separately:

    press_corroboration  ->  MAY this post at all?      (instant/attributed/digest)
    source_authority     ->  WHOSE NAME goes on it?     (primary/marquee/unnamed)

Three citation tiers:

    primary   The body that ISSUED the fact — Federal Reserve, BLS, BEA, ECB,
              Treasury, the White House. Maximum authority; always named.
    marquee   An outlet whose masthead adds standing — Reuters, WSJ, NYT,
              Bloomberg, FT, AP, CNBC, MarketWatch, Barron's, The Economist.
              Always named.
    unnamed   Everything else — relay blogs, aggregators, X accounts, feeds a
              reader has never heard of. NO CREDIT IS EMITTED AT ALL.

AND THE HALF THAT KEEPS THE SILENCE HONEST. Dropping a credit is not free: the
wire charter's admission-not-editorial rule exists so an unverified relayed CLAIM
is never dressed as our own reporting. So an item that cannot be credited must be
able to stand WITHOUT a credit — :func:`self_evident` — and an item that is
neither creditable nor self-evident does not post. Concretely:

    "US ISM Manufacturing PMI for July 55.6 versus 54.0 estimate"
        A published print. Anyone can check it. Ships bare, no credit needed;
        the credit was never what made it true.

    "Sources say the White House is preparing a new tariff package"
        A claim that is only as good as who is making it. With Reuters on it we
        say Reuters. With a no-name blog on it we have nothing to offer the
        reader but our own say-so — so it goes to the digest, not the timeline.

That asymmetry is the whole design: WE STOP BORROWING CREDIBILITY WE CANNOT NAME.

    OPERATOR RULING 2026-08-06 — "NAME REAL NEWSWIRES ONLY". This narrows the
    2026-08-05 law that killed the name outright. That law was written against
    three live cards ("ZeroHedge · WIRE SERVICE", "CNBC · WIRE SERVICE",
    "ForexLive · WIRE SERVICE") and the blanket kill took CNBC down with the
    other two. The ruling separates them: a real newswire or a primary source
    MAY be named, and everything else — aggregators, relay blogs, unknown tiers,
    our own desks — may not. ZeroHedge and ForexLive stay unnamed; CNBC and a
    Federal-Reserve-tier source are named.

    DEFAULT-DENY, AND THE CONFIG IS THE WHOLE ADMISSION. This module supplies no
    built-in chip names: the two lists live in config/press_sources.yml under
    ``citation.card_chip`` so the operator can add or retire a masthead without
    a deploy, and an absent/empty/unparseable config names NOBODY. That is the
    safe direction — the failure mode of a broken config is the 2026-08-05
    behaviour (tier caption alone), never a masthead we did not admit.

    THE TIER STILL DECIDES THE CAPTION; THIS DECIDES THE NAME. An `official`
    source is checked against ``card_chip.official``, a `wire` source against
    ``card_chip.newswire``, and every other tier (aggregator, mirror, x_relay,
    unknown) is refused before either list is read — a mirror relays somebody
    else's copy, so naming the mirror claims a relationship with a newsroom we
    do not have (the same reasoning as ``_NEVER_CITE_TIERS`` above).

    MATCHED ON THE DISPLAY NAME, lower-cased and EXACT. The chip is deciding
    about the exact string it is about to draw, so the string is the key; a
    substring match would let "Reuters-style" or "Not-CNBC" through, which is
    the defect :data:`_MARQUEE_NAMES` documents. The parenthetical mirror note
    is stripped first ("Truth Social (via trumpstruth.org)"), the same
    normalisation :func:`citation` applies, so a name cannot dodge the list by
    carrying its relay in brackets.

    WHY NOT REUSE :func:`authority_tier`. That answers a question about an ITEM
    (host, feed key, event class, corroboration) for the POST BODY's credit
    clause. The renderer holds a name and a tier and nothing else, and the two
    policies are meant to be separately editable — ``never_cite`` retires a
    masthead from the post text, ``card_chip`` admits one to the picture.
