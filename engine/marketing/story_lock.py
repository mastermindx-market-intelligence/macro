"""engine.marketing.story_lock — one conversation, one owner (XG-W2).

THE LAW (charter §2 amendment 6): *one conversation, one owner is a hard lock,
not an editorial preference.* Two of our accounts posting the same story is the
coordination signal no existing gate catches — the near-dup radar only sees it
when the WORDING also collides, and two desks writing the same event in two
genuine voices is precisely the case where the wording does not collide. That is
a network-linkage tell, and the fleet-linkage research is why it is a lock.

MECHANISM. At emission time an item records the STORY KEY it drew from. A second
account drawing the same key inside the lock window is refused. The key is taken
in this order:

  1. an explicit cluster/dedupe key the producer already computed
     (``press_lane._corroboration_key`` — the mirror-collapsed Truth status id,
     or ``claim:{event_class}:{entity}``). Reusing it means the lock inherits the
     press lane's own understanding of "the same claim", including the M3 fix
     that made two differently-worded relays of one claim collapse;
  2. an explicit event/source id;
  3. a normalized-headline hash — the honest fallback, and deliberately last:
     it only catches near-verbatim headlines.

STATE. The lock reads the outbox items this host has already emitted —
``outbox.read_items_all``, i.e. the tracked ``items.jsonl`` PLUS the gitignored
daemon spool ``items-host.jsonl`` — matching on ``source.story_key``. There is
no lock-specific store and no new intraday write beyond the outbox append the
emission was always going to make. Reading the union is load-bearing: the
daemon's own emissions land in the spool, so a tracked-file-only read would
make the lock blind to exactly the lane it most needs to police.

SCOPE. The lock is CROSS-ACCOUNT only. The same account re-drawing its own story
is a repeat, and repeats are the near-dup guard's job — refusing them here would
double-punish an account for updating its own coverage.
