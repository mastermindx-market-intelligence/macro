"""engine.marketing.copywriter — Voice layer that kills bot-copy.

Responsibilities:
  1. verify_signal_live(plan, closes) → (ok, reason)
       Gate: requires last_close, checks underwater/runaway/age.
  2. build_context(item, *, persona, facts, extra) → dict
       Packages everything a writer needs (ticker, plan numbers, chart facts, receipts).
  3. validate_copy(headline, body, ctx) → list[str] violations
       Enforces all copy_laws from config/marketing.yml.
  4. write_posts_deterministic(contexts) → [{headline, body}]
       Fallback: 4-6 genuine variants per (type, persona), fact-woven,
       chosen deterministically. Never produces "The chart. That's it."
  5. write_posts_llm(contexts, cfg) → [{headline, body}] | None
       Optional LLM call; guarded on enabled flag; batched JSON.

# Regex for number-like tokens in copy (%, x, price-like floats)
#
# THE 1-DECIMAL BRANCH IS LOAD-BEARING (Content Studio W1). The rounding law
# writes a $10-100 price with ONE decimal ("34.4", "81.4") and a >=$100 price as
# a bare integer ("285"). Before this branch existed the screen matched only
# percents, multipliers, exactly-2-decimal floats and 3-6 digit integers, so
# every display-form level in the $10-100 band was INVISIBLE to the numbers law:
# a whitelist of ["34.4", "41.2", "45"] licensed a post that wrote "Entry 77.7,
# target 99.9" with zero violations. Invented levels in the band the rounding law
# was written for were the one thing it could not catch.
#: THE k/m/b COMPACT-SUFFIX BRANCH (W2D, 2026-08-12). Every branch above needs a
#: WORD BOUNDARY right after its last digit, and digit-to-letter is never one —
#: so "199k" was invisible to this regex end to end (even the bare-integer
#: branch could not partial-match the "199", for the identical \b reason on its
#: far side). `_extract_number_tokens` found ZERO tokens in "jobless claims
#: 199k", so the invention screen never looked at it: an invented "213k" would
#: have cleared the gate exactly as cleanly as a real one. See
#: docs/marketing_voice_doctrine_v5.md Hard Ban #9 and
#: `market_facts._claims_level_words`, which spelled out "203 thousand"
#: specifically to dodge this hole until the tokenizer could see the register
#: traders actually write. `(?![A-Za-z0-9])` after the suffix stops "199king" /
#: "199k2" reading as a suffixed number; the leading \b keeps a
#: ticker-adjacent run ("Q199k") from donating its tail digits, same as every
#: branch above. The "$" in "$7.6B" is never PART of the match, same as every
#: branch above — \b already sits on the non-word/word edge regardless of what
#: precedes the digit, so nothing extra is needed to drop it.
#:
#: Case-insensitive by construction (`[kKmMbB]`, not a flag) — the file has no
#: `re.IGNORECASE` on this pattern and the `x` multiplier branch above is
#: deliberately lowercase-only ("2.5X" does not match it), so a blanket flag
#: would silently widen that branch too. No space is accepted between the
#: digits and the suffix ("199 k" stays two ordinary tokens) — that spelling is
#: not the register this closes and is explicitly out of scope.

#:
#: THE MOTION-PREPOSITION OVER-FIRE (2026-07-31 adversarial review). Wave 1 gave
#: `_TARGET_SLOT_RE` the motion prepositions `toward|towards|up to|looking for|
#: aiming for|en route to`. Those words are NOT price vocabulary the way
#: `entry|target|t1|stop` are — English uses them for magnitudes of every kind —
#: so three ordinary sentences started rejecting as `invented_level`:
#:
#:     "Volume ran up to 3 million shares"   -> invented_level '3'
#:     "Grinding toward 5 straight weeks"    -> invented_level '5'
#:     "toward 2 handles"                    -> invented_level '2'
#:
#: The unit / multiplier / tally nouns below are the minimal rule that closes
#: all three. It is deliberately the SAME noun test the slot rule already ran
#: rather than a second mechanism, because the discriminator is identical: a
#: price is written BARE ("toward 190"), and a count is written with the thing
#: it counts ("toward 5 straight weeks"). The two other discriminators the
#: review floated — "require a decimal point or a $ prefix for the new
#: prepositions" — were measured and rejected: they would unpin
#: `toward 228` / `toward 44` / `looking for 228 next`, which ARE the defect-5
#: regression pins (a fabricated target is nearly always a bare integer), and a
#: `$` override would newly false-fire on "up to $3 million in volume".
#:
#: `handles` is PLURAL ONLY, on purpose. "toward 2 handles" is a move of two
#: points; "toward the 190 handle" names a price zone and must stay catchable.

    spike"). Those strings are BOTH the writer's raw material and, through
    `{top_fact}`, deterministic copy — so the rounding has to happen here rather
    than in every producer, and the producers stay the single source of the
    underlying numbers.

    PERCENTS ARE DELIBERATELY LEFT ALONE, and that is not an oversight:
      * Every percent producer in this package already writes the 1-decimal
        signed form (`f"{v:+.1f}%"` in market_facts, movers_source, theme
        facts, content_studio, tape_stamp), which IS the corpus register.
        There is no 2-decimal percent to fix.
      * The whitelist is the only thing copy may quote, and the publish-time
        mover/theme lanes compose their body text in their OWN modules from the
        same `+.1f` form. Rounding "-14.0%" to "-14%" here would round the fact
        text and the whitelist while those lanes kept writing "-14.0%", so the
        two halves of one post would stop agreeing — a numbers-law violation
        manufactured by a cosmetic change.
      * Nothing is lost: a model that invents a 2-decimal percent on a figure
        of 10 or more is still rejected by `fake_precision_violations`.
    Integers, years and dates are untouched: they carry no decimal point.

    PRECISION ONLY EVER GOES DOWN. `format_display_price` PADS a sub-$10 value to
    two decimals because that is the register for a price ("4.87", "0.50"), but
    this function runs over arbitrary fact prose where a 1-decimal token is
    usually not a price at all: "1.8x" became "1.80x" and "(range: 3.4)" became
    "3.40", and because the same pass writes the whitelist the model was then
    required to reproduce the padded spelling. So a rewrite that would ADD

#     Four up, near highs, VWAP holds
#     $AAPL -0.6% off the 52-week high at 334.99 and up four weeks straight.
#     That Jun 26 anchored VWAP has held for 20 sessions. I'm watching a close
#     below it, not chasing.
#
# It broke no rule in this validator and no rule in copy_review: the numbers were
# whitelisted, the cashtag was present, nothing was repeated, nothing was cheesy.
# It was simply not decodable. "Four up" is a count with no noun (four what?
# days, weeks, names?); "That ... VWAP" points at a thing the post never
# introduced; "a close below it" is the whole actionable content of the post and
# it names no price. Every existing rule asks "is this line CLEAN?" — none asked
# "can a stranger who was not looking at our chart understand it?"
#
# Both detectors are deliberately narrow. copy_review's doctrine applies here too:
# a gate that cries wolf stops meaning anything, and terseness, fragments and dry
# understatement are the HOUSE VOICE, not defects. So neither fires on short copy,

#   "to" / "in" STRANDED by a phrasal verb — "{cashtag} chart I keep coming back
#     to", "The current my group is swimming in".
# Stranding is possible for most prepositions here; these are the ones the house

# lives in `banned_language`, which the publisher runs as its last gate on every

# were headline + 2-4 clipped sentences, while the corpus of 286 real posts from
# 17 winning accounts is 48.6% ONE dense line, 17.1% headline+blank+body, 34.3%
# multi-line stacks (x_corpus/stats.md finding 1). validate_copy_v2 takes the

#
# TWO HALVES TO THE FIX and both are needed. (1) The budget is now per shape and

# house default because three figures in one dense line IS the salad the law
# exists to stop. (2) The contract prose is rendered FROM this dict, so the
# number the model reads and the number the validator enforces cannot drift
# apart again by a one-sided edit — and each contract now demands the NARRATIVE

"""Lecture register (operator, 2026-07-30).

The operator read the education posts and called them terrible, useless, and
lecturing: "no one likes being lectured... we want to provide value without
making it seem like we are superior to others, or cocky/arrogant/ego vibes."
Most desks are women, and a superior register reads worse from them and costs
follows.

The template bank was built on it — "The difference between those two sentences
is most of trading", "Anyone can show winners", "Early looks identical to wrong
for longer than anyone admits", "The half of trading nobody talks about". But
the LLM inherits it too, because nothing forbade it: a live sample produced both
"Turns out doing nothing is still a position. I didn't take a trade, so there's
no win or loss to dress up" (right) and "If you can't name what proves you wrong
before the trade, you're not managing risk. You're waiting for the market to
explain it with your money" (wrong, and worse than the template — it accuses
the reader directly).

The tell is grammatical person. A good post says what I DID. A lecture says what
YOU are doing wrong, or what MOST PEOPLE fail to grasp. That is what this
checks; the open-ended half ("does this feel superior?") belongs to the critic.

# shit. it makes us look indecisive and provides zero value. NO one wants to
# read this. It kills authority and causes unfollows and zero engagement. Need
# to completely wipe out this shit."
#
# MEASURED: 8 of 66 copy strings on one nightly plan (12.1%) were this register.
#   "$CWK keeps failing at its long-term price line. I stayed out."
#   "$ARES keeps holding 123. I passed early and won't chase it now."

#   "$NUE closed at a fresh yearly high. I passed and won't chase."
#   "$HII just joined the movers around $326. I'm watching, not chasing."
#
# THE ROOT CAUSE IS THE HOUSE LAW, WHICH IS WHY A DETECTOR ALONE CANNOT FIX IT.
# The law says "a fact plus a reaction that COSTS the author". The cheapest way
# to make a reaction sound costly is to admit it did nothing — "I passed", "I
# missed it", "buyers didn't". So the law written to add conviction was
# manufacturing fake humility, and the config phrasing had to change with this
# guard (see `config/marketing.yml` copy_laws, and the writer prompt's cost
# menu). This module keeps the executable half.
#
# THE APPARENT CONFLICT WITH THE FSLR LAW, RESOLVED. There is a standing rule:
# never issue a directional stance the engines did not compute
# (`uncomputed_stance` above). That rule does NOT mean "advertise that you have
# no view". It means: if the engines computed nothing, DO NOT POST. Silence is
# the lawful no-stance shape; a shrug is not. So the two guards agree — one
# forbids inventing a stance, the other forbids publishing the absence of one,
# and the lawful residue between them is a post that says what the tape did and
# what would change the desk's mind.
#
# RELATIONSHIP TO `_COST_FAMILIES` BELOW. That table already knows this register
# as `outside-the-move` and CAPPED it at half a batch. A cap was the right
# instrument while the confession was legal and merely repetitive; the operator
# has now ruled the confession itself worthless at any share. The family stays in
# the monoculture table (it still describes the other cost families' shape), but

# UNCOMPUTED DIRECTIONAL STANCE (defect 4, operator 2026-08-03)
#
# THE POST. "$FSLR, biggest move in the index today / FSLR surged +10.3% today
# (Technology). Real strength or real damage, either way I'd let it settle
# first." The operator: "this just did a daily MACD cross and is washed out
# after 2 months of downtrend... If it launched then the best thing to do is to
# chase in, since it already got washed. So us saying to let it settle is the
# dumbest thing ever and just ruins our reputation."
#
# THE RULING. The fault is not the direction, it is that the desk ISSUED A
# TRADING STANCE IT HAD NOT COMPUTED. The sentence came out of a template bank
# selected by a crc32 of ticker+account+slot; nothing in that hash reads a
# chart. A line that says "let it settle" over every large move is wrong about
# half the time by construction, and it reads as ignorance exactly when it is.
# So: we do not tell anyone what to DO with a move unless we computed the setup.
# Two lawful shapes remain — no stance at all, or a stance built on a state the
# engines actually supplied (see movers_source.technical_state).
#
# WHY THIS IS A SHAPE RULE AND NOT A BANNED-PHRASE LIST. `_STOCK_CLOSERS` above
# is the phrase-list version of the same class ("strength worth respecting not
# chasing here"), and its own docstring records what happened next: the model
# paraphrased the edges and kept the spine. A list scoped to the lines one
# postmortem happened to catch is a regression pin, not a sweep — the fifth
# variant nobody has written yet sails straight through it. The rule below is
# two-factor instead:
#
#     an ACTION that names a trade decision  ×  a FRAME that prescribes or
#     defers it
#
# "Watching, not chasing" is ACTION(chasing) × FRAME(not). "I'd let it settle
# first" is ACTION(settle) × FRAME(I'd / let / first). "Day one after a move
# this size is for watching, not heroics" is ACTION(heroics) × FRAME(not). None
# of the three shares a phrase with the others; all three share the shape.
#
# WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* AN ACTION. "position" is absent from the list, and
# that is load-bearing: "No position" is a statement of fact about our own book,
# not a recommendation, and it is exactly the honest thing a no-stance post is
# supposed to be able to say. Likewise "watch"/"watching" alone — observing is
# not a trade decision, so it only trips the rule when it sits next to one
# ("watching, not chasing").
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

#: THE DESCRIPTIVE CARVE-OUT. "Buying" and "selling" are also the ordinary mass
#: nouns for what the TAPE did, and in that use they name nobody's decision:
#: "First green that means anything after months of selling" reports a
#: downtrend, exactly the observation this rule wants copy to make instead of a
#: stance. Governed by a preposition, the word is a description of the market,
#: so it is removed before the two-factor test rather than counted by it.
#:
#: Found by the 2026-08-04 merge, not by review: the bucket lines and this
#: detector shipped from two different lanes for the SAME postmortem, and the
#: detector quarantined the very copy the other lane wrote to fix it. Scoped
#: deliberately narrow — only the buy/sell family, only after a preposition —
#: because every other action stem in the list below has no innocent noun sense
#: in this register ("months of chasing" is not a thing anyone writes).
#: TWO descriptive shapes, both about the market rather than about us:
#:   1. governed by a preposition - "months of selling", "after weeks of buying";
#:   2. a market-structure NOUN COMPOUND - "a buy signal", "sell pressure",
#:      "the buy side". These name a phenomenon, and copy most often reaches for
#:      them to DENY one ("that's a fact about crowds, not a buy signal"), which
#:      is the exact opposite of issuing an instruction.
#:   3. the PLURAL AGENT NOUN - "$T is not finding buyers", "no sellers left".
#:      Shipped (weekend_levels `downtrend` headline #2) and quarantined by this
#:      detector on the frame word "not", which is the shape-rule failure the
#:      carve-out above already exists for: "buyers" is a crowd on the tape, and
#:      naming who is absent prescribes nothing. The word only had to reach
#:      `buy\w*` to be read as a trade decision.
#:      SINGULAR IS LEFT ALONE, and "being buyers" is carved back out of the
#:      strip: "worth being a buyer here" / "worth being buyers under 33" is the
#:      desk casting ITSELF as the participant, which is a stance and must keep
#:      firing. Absent that guard this narrowing would be a disarm.

#: was aimed at SPECULATIVE forward level-stacks ("I want 151 before leaning
#: toward 190, then 228"), never at dated precedent — a breaking post with no

"""The anchorless macro read (operator kill, 2026-08-01).

Three posts were pulled off the queue in one morning:

    "4 of 11 sectors green on a day growth data firmed and inflation stayed
     warm. Not a clean enough read to lean on yet."
    "Not a clearcut tape. Growth firming a bit, inflation still warm, and only
     4 of 11 sectors managed green. I'm watching, not deciding."
    "growth data firmed a touch while inflation stayed warm. 4 of 11 sectors
     closed green. steady liquidity is the part i'm watching..."

Operator: "too bland, too weak, no real value, so esoteric no one knows what
it's talking about, zero engagement, people might even report us cuz only
bots/llm write garbage like this."

EVERY EXISTING GATE PASSED ALL THREE, and correctly: the copy is honest,
in-register, non-stale, denominated, and carries a stance that costs the writer
something. What it does NOT carry is a PRINT. "Growth data firmed" is a claim
about nothing a reader can look up — no release, no number, no publisher.
It is the last enumerable defect class in this file's family: the denominator
law fixed counts with no universe, the jargon gate fixed vocabulary the reader
cannot see, and this fixes CLAIMS THE READER CANNOT CHECK.

Note what is deliberately NOT the rule: "a macro post must contain a number."
All three corpses contain "4 of 11", and it did not save them. A sector count
is our own arithmetic over a board; a print is a release somebody published.
The gate asks for the second kind.

THE RULE IS CONDITIONAL, WHICH IS WHY IT CAN BE THIS BROAD. An abstraction is
only a violation when the post has no anchor anywhere in it. "The tape" is
house voice and stays legal in a post that also says "jobless claims at
203,000"; it is a violation in a post that says nothing else. So the list may
name the phrases the operator actually reads as filler without banning the
register, and a post that does the work keeps every word it had.

#
# A week of shipped posts closed 27% of the time on one of NINE sentences:
# "Watching, no position." five times, "Patience, annoyingly, is the play."
# five times, and seven more of the same kind. Every one of those posts cleared
# every gate this module had, and correctly so:
#
#   * `_STOCK_CLOSERS` bans the closers the house prompt once MANDATED, and
#     these were not on that list;
#   * `stock_closer_violations`' collision arm compares against `batch_texts`,
#     which is ONE night's plan. Five uses spread over five nights collide with
#     nothing;
#   * `repeated_sentence_violations` does reach back across days, but its
#     `_REPEAT_SENTENCE_MIN_WORDS = 5` floor exists to protect the deadpan
#     one-word verdicts, and "Watching, no position." is three words. The
#     sentence that welded the feed shut sat exactly underneath the floor.
#
# So this is the day-spanning closer gate, and it is deliberately NOT the same
# instrument as `repeated_sentence_violations`: it compares FINAL SENTENCE to
# FINAL SENTENCE only, which is what lets its floor drop to three words without
# touching the mid-post cadence that floor was protecting. "Ugly." and "Not
# ideal." (one and two words) stay free to recur forever, because a one-beat

# ── Invented ladders: a target the fact packet never carried (defect 5) ───────
#
# THE POST THAT PROVED IT. Kelly's $TPR signal printed "I want 151 before
# leaning toward 190, then 228" on a plan whose only forward level was T1
# 189.63. "190" is legitimate (189.63 in display form IS 190). "228" was
# invented whole, and it passed every gate:
#
#   * the whitelist rule (validate_copy step 5) asks "is this number in the
#     packet", and 228 WAS in the packet, as a 52-week-high chart fact. A number
#     can be true as a fact and a fabrication as a target;
#   * `price_slot_tokens` only recognises entry / target / t1 / t2 / stop /
#     below / above / under / over / at / near. "leaning toward 190" and "then
#     228" are target language that no slot word introduces, so the level arm
#     never looked at either token.
#
# This gate closes the SEMANTIC half the whitelist cannot see: a number the post
# asks the reader to aim at must come from the plan's own forward levels
# (entry / t1 / t2 / invalidation / stop), not from anywhere else in the packet.
# Rejection reason carries the literal token `invented_level` so the drop stage
# is greppable in the nightly report.
#
# THE LADDER IS THE WHOLE POINT. "190, then 228" is two targets, and only the
# first is introduced by a target word. So a hit licenses a scan forward through
# `then` / `and then` / `next` continuations, each of which inherits the target
# semantics of the number it follows. `then` is NOT a target word on its own —
# "held for three sessions, then gave it back" must stay legal — which is why it
# only fires as a continuation of a slot that already matched.

# VOICE DOCTRINE v5 — the register screen (docs/marketing_voice_doctrine_v5.md)
#
# THE THESIS: the read is in the SELECTION, not in a performed reaction. A post
# earns its place by surfacing a dated numeric market fact plus the context that
# makes it mean something. The account's personality is its beat and its format
# signature, never manufactured interiority.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. v4 commanded the opposite in this very module: the system
# prompt said "Mix 'I' and 'we'... Give a stance: watching, leaning, respecting,
# fading", `CORPUS_EXEMPLARS` fed first-person lines, and `validate_copy`
# REQUIRED a theme_list to end on "?". The output was a model performing a
# trader having feelings about a trade: "I'm leaning on that history unless the
# rebound stalls here", "Am I getting a second session out of this?",
# "Watching, no position." Measured on the 679-item shipped corpus (census
# 2026-08-11): first person in 175 items (25.8%), "so far today" x79, and the
# two confession closers above dominating the 72 items that end on a zinger.
# Across 205 posts from 12 real data accounts, rhetorical-question hooks, topic
# hashtags and exclamation emphasis appear ZERO times.
#
# THE WIRE FAMILY IS EXEMPT FROM THE PRONOUN AND QUESTION SCREENS, and the
# exemption is evidence-driven rather than a convenience. A wire post RELAYS a
# source's words, so both tokens arrive as quoted material the desk did not
# author: of the 4 breaking items carrying "?" in the census, 2 are relayed
# source headlines ("$400 Billion Pharma Megadeal? Jefferies Calls...", "Europe
# Was Once Bigger Than The US Economy. What Happened?"), and 2 of the 3 carrying
# first person are relayed source copy. The doctrine says the wire register is
# already correct and leaves it unchanged; screening it here would darken
# correct posts. Every OTHER v5 ban still applies to the wire.
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    WHY THIS EXISTS ON TOP OF ``validate_copy_v2``. The general numeric gate
    (``validate_copy`` -> numbers whitelist) SKIPS bare one- and two-digit
    integers, and it has to: ordinary copy counts things ("3 names", "2 weeks")
    and the whitelist cannot carry every small integer the language needs. But
    the reporting lag IS a bare one- or two-digit integer, always. So on these
    two lanes the one number the disclosure law exists to protect was the one
    number the model was free to write: "disclosed 6 days later" on a 47-day lag
    passed every gate, read as compliant, and was false.

    The check is ``hot_tape_llm.numeric_violations`` IMPORTED, never forked, so
    the filing lanes inherit its tolerances (sign-insensitive, trailing-zero
    tolerant, truncation-aware) and any future fix to them.

    THE PACKET IS WHAT THE PROMPT HANDED OUT. The gate judges against the same
    fact-bearing payload keys the writer was shown, for the reason the reply desk
    learned the hard way: a gate given LESS than the prompt rejects a model for
    obeying it, and a gate given MORE (persona/codex prose) licenses numbers no
    filing contains.

    FAILS CLOSED. If the gate itself cannot run, the item is refused rather than
    passed: dropping a disclosure post costs one post, and shipping an unchecked
    one costs a claim about a filing. Empty list = clean.

    TICKER DEPENDENCY (derived from the template text, no tag to forget). A

    "{cashtag}" renders as a fragment ("{cashtag} is close" → "is close") and
    ships, because validate_copy's cashtag law is gated on ``if ticker:``. So:
      - no ticker in ctx → every variant using a single-ticker token
        (_TICKER_DEPENDENT_TOKENS: the cashtag pair plus the plan/receipt price
        slots, which a no-ticker context has none of either) is excluded;

        pool for every existing ticker-bearing post byte-identical to what it
        was before the ticker-free lines were added, so hash-based variant

      "down_only" / "up_only": the line's flavor only fits that tape direction
        (mover direction from the signed mover_pct, theme from theme_direction);
        unknown direction (empty fields) filters NOTHING, so the nightly D-slot
        path (no _mover_data/_theme_data) selects from the full bank unchanged.
      "needs_chart": the line references an attached chart ("Chart below",
        "levels are on the chart"); filtered ONLY when the caller explicitly set
        ctx["has_chart"] = False (text-only publish-time items). Unset → kept.
      "needs_state" / "no_state": the two mover shapes the 2026-08-03 stance
        ruling leaves lawful, and they PARTITION the mover bank — exactly one of
        the two is selectable for any given context, never a mix.
          * "needs_state" lines cite ``{mover_state}``, the technical state
            movers_source computed from the name's own daily bars. Without that
            state the token renders empty and the sentence becomes a fragment,
            so they are excluded when ctx["mover_state"] is empty.
          * "no_state" lines are the no-stance shape: the move, what is
            observable, and stop. They are excluded when a state IS available,
            because a post that had the computed read and shipped the shrug
            instead is a wasted read. The partition is what makes "a fixture
            with a known state produces copy citing it" a testable claim rather

# write_posts_llm_v2 — per-post model calls (Content Studio W1)
#
# WHAT KILLED v1. `write_posts_llm` batches the whole night into ONE call:
# 60 posts, max_tokens 6000, ~100 tokens of budget for a post that needs ~170
# tokens of required JSON. It truncated, `json.loads` failed the length check,
# the function returned None, and EVERY post silently fell back to the
# deterministic templates. That is the entire content of the 2026-07-29 batch
# the operator aborted reviewing (masterplan §1). One failure zeroed the night.
#
# THE FIX (masterplan §0 gate 2, contract §Writer API). One call per item, a
# per-post token budget, bounded parallelism, and per-item isolation: a poisoned
# context costs its own post and nothing else. There is NO template fallback on
# this path — a planned post that cannot be written is DROPPED and counted,
# because the whole ruling of this wave is that template prose never again
# reaches a reader on a diary-register lane.

# THE PAYLOAD CONTRACT (autopsy defect 3, 2026-07-31).

# `_v2_item_payload` shipped `codex{worldview, franchises, restraint,
# open_promises, worn_out_phrases}`, `franchise`, `lead_with`, `pack`,
# `win_rate`, `example_lines` and the four plan levels into every user turn, and
# the system prompt named NONE of them. Verified programmatically: a scan of the
# prompt text for each key returned zero hits for all of the above. The model
# received a persona codex, a phrase-fatigue list and a promise ledger with no
# statement of what any of them BIND, which is worse than not sending them: an
# unexplained JSON key is read as decoration, and `worn_out_phrases` read as
# decoration is a list of phrases the model may cheerfully reuse.
#
# So the prompt now carries a line per key saying what force it has. This tuple
# is the authoritative list and the prompt is checked against it by
# `tests/test_marketing_copy_v2.py`: a key added to the payload without a
# contract line turns that test red, which is the only mechanism that keeps a
# payload and a prompt from drifting apart again. Nested keys are listed with
# their parent's name because that is how they appear in the JSON the model

    # appropriately' and 'do your own work' on any signal post with no base
    # rate, while the HARD BANS block sixty lines down banned compliance caveats
    # and `machine_risk_violations` rejects both of the first two by regex. The

    # get its post repaired and then dropped: a guaranteed repair turn, a
    # guaranteed validate-stage drop, and no way for an obedient model to win.
    # The honest-uncertainty move is expressed in the house's own voice now: a

# ── The prompt-vs-its-own-bans scan (autopsy defect 1's regression pin) ──────
#
# The prompt has to be able to QUOTE the phrases it bans, or a ban list cannot
# be written at all. That is exactly what made defect 1 invisible for months:
# "size appropriately" appearing in the prompt is normal, and nobody could tell
# the two occurrences apart by grep because one was a ban and the other was an
# ORDER to write it.
#
# So the scan is paragraph-scoped, and these are the paragraph heads whose JOB
# is to quote banned material. Everything else in the prompt is PRESCRIPTIVE:
# what it contains, it is asking for. A banned phrase in a prescriptive
# paragraph is a self-cancelling instruction and the test that reads this fails.
# Adding a head here is the way to make that test go quiet, which is the point:
# it costs an explicit, reviewable claim that the new paragraph quotes rather
# than prescribes.
#
# EVERY HEAD HERE IS LOAD-BEARING, AND THAT IS ENFORCED (2026-07-31 adversarial
# review). A mutation sweep — drop one head, re-run the scan — found four
# entries that suppressed nothing. Two of them were dead by CONSTRUCTION and are
# now gone:
#
#   "EXEMPLARS (real posts"        the corpus block is subtracted from the
#   "THESE SHIPPED FROM THIS DESK" prompt BY VALUE before the paragraph split
#                                  (see prescriptive_prompt_paragraphs), so all
#                                  that survived the subtraction was the bare
#                                  header line — house text, which has to pass
#                                  the scan like any other order. Exempting it
#                                  only hid a future typo.
#
# The other two the sweep named are kept, because the sweep ran against
# ``_v2_system_prompt({})`` and neither paragraph EXISTS in that prompt:
#
#   "OTHER LAWS"        emitted only when cfg carries copy_laws. Against the
#                       SHIPPED config/marketing.yml (36 laws, most of them ban
#                       lists) dropping this head produces a hit. Measured, not
#                       assumed; pinned by a test.
#   "RATIFIED EXEMPLARS" emitted only when the exemplar store has an active
#                       version pin. This deployment ships that store dark, so
#                       the sweep saw nothing. The block is OTHER PEOPLE'S posts
#                       and is NOT value-subtracted, so arming the pin would put
#                       third-party copy under the scan and turn an operator
#                       ratification into a red test about data rather than

    of the user turn's item, under a key the prompt never named. Where the two

    that make one desk sound unlike another: "No exclamation marks" against
    Meagan's registered one-per-post exclamation, "No puns" against cards whose

        THE GAP THIS CLOSES. `make_call` treats any call that does not RAISE as
        a success, so a provider that answers HTTP 200 with no text ends the
        walk — the three healthy rungs underneath it are never tried, and the
        item dies holding a working credential list. That is the 07-30/07-31
        shape: DeepSeek served every call, 200 every time, and codex/oauth/
        anthropic were never asked. So the textless case gets an explicit
        one-rung failover here, in the caller, where the per-item budget is
        known — make_call itself must keep treating a served response as served,
        because every other consumer depends on that.

        AND THE OTHER HALF OF IT (2026-08-02, W4e). A reply that arrives and
        cannot be PARSED used to leave through `return _v2_extract_text(raw)`

        string, which is only reachable from this branch: the provider ANSWERED
