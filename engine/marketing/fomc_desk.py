"""FOMC statement-diff desk — the fast lane that fires on the 14:00 ET statement.

WHAT IT PRODUCES, within minutes of the release:
  1. a FLAGSHIP house-view post — a tight hook in the body, and the 2-4 paragraph
     analysis rendered ONTO the diff card (engine/marketing/fomc_card.py)
  2. a mastermind_news STRAIGHT RELAY — decision, range, vote, no stance

WHY TWO POSTS AND NOT ONE. The wire account relays and never takes a stance
(charter §4 safety rails); the flagship exists to carry the house read. One event,
two registers, two audiences. They are enqueued as separate items so either can
fail without taking the other down, and so the outbox's own cross-account
near-duplicate guard sees them as what they are.

THE ANALYSIS IS LLM-REQUIRED; THE RELAY IS NOT. This mirrors the split the repo
already ratified (config/marketing.yml copywriter.llm.required, and the note there
that the WIRE lanes keep their deterministic fallback): wire register survives
templating and a house read does not. So when the waterfall is mute or its copy
cannot be validated, the relay still posts from a deterministic template built out
of the extracted facts, and the flagship analysis post is SKIPPED rather than
templated. Nothing about "the Fed changed its language" can be written by a
template without inventing the reading.

EVERY CLAIM TRACES TO THE FACT SHEET. The model is handed the decision facts, the
diff, and the statement text; :func:`validate_copy` then rejects any copy carrying
a number that does not appear in that corpus. That is what stops the failure mode
this lane is most exposed to: a confident post about interest rates containing a
market probability, a forecast or a level nobody gave it.

FAIL-SOFT AT EVERY SEAM. :func:`fire` never raises and never blocks the press
tick. One firing per meeting, remembered in the statements ledger.

    any of them.

    NO EXPLICIT DAILY CAP IS PASSED, AND THAT IS A DECISION. `outbox.enqueue`
    enforces `effective_cap(cfg)` at the queue seam (the publisher's immediate-rail
    exemption is applied LATER, at auto-approve, and cannot rescue an item the
    queue already refused). config/marketing.yml currently sets
    `sentinel.max_posts_per_account_per_day: -1`, i.e. unlimited, so an FOMC post
    cannot be refused for volume today. This lane deliberately does NOT pass its
    own override: the Sentinel cap is the operator's instrument and a desk that
    silently exempts itself from it is how a ceiling stops meaning anything. The
    coupling is real, though — if that cap is ever given a finite value, this
    desk inherits it and a quarterly post could be refused as `cap_exceeded` on a
    busy day. The refusal is announced (`::warning fomc-not-queued`) rather than
    silent, which is the part that matters for catching it.

    flagship account, and the meeting's one firing consumed.
