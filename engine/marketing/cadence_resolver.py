"""engine.marketing.cadence_resolver — per-account posting cadence (XG-W2).

WHAT THIS REPLACES. ``config/marketing.yml`` sets
``sentinel.max_posts_per_account_per_day: -1`` (operator 2026-07-24, autonomous
cadence). That sentinel is a GLOBAL backstop and it is honest about being one —
it says nothing about who is posting. With one live account that read fine; with
seven it means seven accounts share one unbounded ceiling, and the per-account
``cadence:`` blocks in ``config/personas/<id>.yml`` were decorative (nothing read
them). This module is the per-account law the specs always described:

    the sentinel -1 stays the global backstop it is;
    the resolver bounds each account from ITS OWN spec.

The two compose — an account is allowed to post only when BOTH agree. Lowering
the sentinel back to a real number still binds; raising it does not widen a
persona past its spec. The D08 age ramp narrows the sentinel side per account
(``outbox.effective_cap_for``, #3884), so the full daily-volume bound is
stricter-of(base, tier, spec).

NOT YET COMPOSED (#3884 F6). The ramp tier also carries its own
``min_minutes_between_posts``, and nothing consumes it at post time — this
module reads SPACING from the persona spec alone. A week-1 desk is therefore
tier-bounded on volume and spec-bounded on spacing. Composing them is the
remaining half of the tier-aware cadence contract; it needs the resolver to take
an account age, which is a design decision rather than a patch, so it is named
here instead of being half-built.

WHY THE SPEC FLOORS SIT BELOW THE RAMP'S 30 MINUTES (2026-07-28). Because of the
above, a spec floor is not a wall-clock cadence — the LADDER paces (28 rungs at
30-minute steps) and this floor only stops a burst. The publisher sweeps on that
same 30-minute grid and books each post at ``now + jitter`` (up to
``publish.post_jitter_max_min``), while the check below measures elapsed time
from that BOOKED stamp at the next sweep. So the gap it can ever see is one step
minus the send jitter, 23 minutes on today's grid. A floor at 30 — merely MATCHING
the ramp's stated ``min_minutes_between_posts`` — therefore refuses the next rung
every time and the desk runs at half cadence, ~15 posts/day against a 20/day tier,
with every number in both configs still reading correctly. The committed specs sit
at 20 + 3 jitter for exactly this reason.
``tests/test_marketing_cadence_ramp_coherence.py`` pins the relation.

DOCTRINE (constitution §13.8 "Adaptive cadence" — the requirements spec).
Cadence should reflect market opportunity, account territory, time zone, recent
topic load, relationship follow-ups, profile needs and output quality. v1 ships
the CONFIG-DRIVEN half of that list, deterministically and with no LLM in the
path:

    time zone / territory  -> ``cadence.session`` (XG-W2, new schema field)
    account territory      -> ``cadence.posts_per_day`` + ``min_spacing_min``
    realism (no clock tell)-> ``cadence.jitter_min``, derived from a seed
    profile needs          -> ``cadence.weekend_shape``

The remaining inputs — market opportunity, recent topic load, relationship
follow-ups, output quality — need signals that do not exist yet. They arrive
with the XG-W5 scoring brain. The seam is explicit and typed: ``resolve()``
takes a ``market_state`` argument that v1 ignores and documents, so wiring the
scorer in later is an implementation change inside this module, not a signature
change at every call site. NOTHING here consults an LLM, and nothing here
escalates: the resolver may only REFUSE or allow, exactly like every other
deterministic gate in the marketing stack.

DETERMINISM. Jitter is derived from ``crc32(seed)``, never from a clock or an
RNG (the same law ``publish.post_jitter_max_min`` already follows in
``scripts/marketing_publisher.py``), so a dry-run and the live run resolve
identically and no test needs to freeze randomness.

STATE. The resolver reads posting history from the state the publisher ALREADY
maintains — the outbox status ledger (``posted``/``posting`` rows). It opens no
new intraday store: the fastlane daemon on the VPS makes zero repo writes and
must keep making zero.
