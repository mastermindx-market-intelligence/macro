"""engine.marketing.copy_critic — the cold-read critic (Content Studio W1).

Program: ``research/MARKETING_CONTENT_STUDIO_LLM_FIRST_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md``
§0 gate 5 ("cold-read critic on every planned post"), §4 (the CRITIC stage of
the nightly pipeline) and §7 (generation-time review). Interface pinned by
``research/marketing_dockets/CONTENT_STUDIO_W1_BUILD_CONTRACT.md`` §Critic.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Six sessions patched the template generator in four days (#3904 volume, #3907
fragments, #3913 publish faults, #3918 headline gate, #3922 a hand-rewrite of a
whole day's queue, #3928 tail coherence) and the operator still aborted the
2026-07-29 review in disgust. The pattern every time: the patch adds an
enumerated ban, the generator cannot SEE its own output, and the next failure
mode is one synonym away — "screen" was not on the list that banned
"cross-checks". Coherence is not enumerable. Does the tail follow from the fact?
Does "that level" point at anything? Would a stranger scrolling past understand
this at all? The only system that can judge prose is a language model.

So: the deterministic validators check what must never be WRONG (numbers,
cashtags, shape, banned language). This checks what a human would CRINGE at.

THE TWO LAWS THAT BOUND IT
--------------------------
1. **De-escalation only.** The critic returns a verdict and reasons. It never
   rewrites, never proposes copy, and never adds a fact — only the writer writes
   and only the engine originates numbers (CLAUDE.md §Epistemics; masterplan §9).
   That is enforced structurally: this module reads ``verdict`` and ``reasons``
   out of the reply and discards everything else, so a model that "helpfully"
   returns a rewritten post has produced nothing.
2. **A failing critic is not a failing post.** The validators already ran. A
   provider outage, a malformed reply, an absent credential — all of it returns
   ``pass`` with the contracted reason ``["critic_unavailable"]``, the specific
   cause in ``detail``, and ONE ``::warning`` per cause per run. The WRITER lane
   failing is fatal for its item; the critic failing is not.

FRESH CONTEXT IS THE WHOLE POINT
--------------------------------
The critic sees the post, its kind, its shape, its allowed numbers and a
one-line topic. It does NOT see the persona card, the fact packet, the plan, or
the writer's prompt. Authorship bias is the failure it exists to catch: copy is
comprehensible to the desk that wrote it by definition, and every post in the
rejected batch parsed perfectly to the engine that assembled it.

IMPORT-CLOSURE LAW
------------------
**stdlib only at module import.** ``engine.llm_auth``, ``anthropic``, ``yaml``
and ``lib.config`` are imported lazily inside functions. The marketing-engine CI
lane installs pytest + pyyaml + jinja2 and nothing else, so a module-level
``import anthropic`` here turns that lane red at COLLECTION, before a single
test runs. ``tests/test_marketing_copy_v2.py`` scans this file's source to pin
it.
