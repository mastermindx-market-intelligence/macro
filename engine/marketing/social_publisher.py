"""engine.marketing.social_publisher — Backend-agnostic social publisher (W1).

The missing publish half of the D02 desk network: takes text (and optional
media/link) and pushes it to a social channel through a pluggable backend.
The only backend implemented today is Buffer's GraphQL API (personal access
token). The publisher itself knows nothing about the outbox ledger — the runner
(scripts/marketing_publisher.py) owns queue state; this module owns "send one
post, return a receipt".

DARK BY DEFAULT. Nothing here fires a network call unless a caller invokes
publish()/list_channels() with a real token AND a real transport. Every network
byte flows through BufferPublisher._transport(), which tests monkeypatch so the
whole module is exercised with ZERO live traffic.

Fail-soft contract (mirrors engine/marketing/outbox.py):
  * Public methods NEVER raise. Any network/GraphQL/parse error becomes a
    Receipt(ok=False, error=...) (publish) or [] (list_channels) with a
    log.warning. A crashing backend must never crash the runner mid-post.
  * All file/config derivation uses _repo_root() from __file__, never cwd.

Buffer GraphQL contract (confirmed 2026-07-22 from developers.buffer.com):
  endpoint   POST https://api.buffer.com                     [guides/your-first-post]
  auth       Authorization: Bearer <token>                   [api-standards / your-first-post]
  channels   query { channels(input:{organizationId}) { id name service } }
             org id via  query { account { organizations { id name } } }
  create     mutation { createPost(input: CreatePostInput) { ...union } }
             CreatePostInput = { text, channelId, schedulingType, mode,
                                 dueAt?, assets? }
             assets (CURRENT format, changed 2026-05-25) is an ordered list of
               { image: { url } }  or  { video: { url, metadata:{thumbnailOffset} } }
               — Buffer hosts NO uploads; each url must be publicly reachable.
             response is a UNION resolved with inline fragments:
               ... on PostActionSuccess { post { id text dueAt } }
               ... on MutationError    { message }
  delete     mutation { deletePost(input: DeletePostInput!): DeletePostPayload! }
             DeletePostInput = { id: PostId! }
             DeletePostPayload is a union of DeletePostSuccess { id } and
             VoidMutationError. Per the error-handling guide the API never
             returns VoidMutationError by name — the documented pattern is to
             select the `... on MutationError { message }` CATCH-ALL (which
             VoidMutationError satisfies) so a later-added error member still
             delivers its message without a query change. Same shape as create.
  The endpoint + query/mutation strings live in the module constants below so
  they are trivial to update as the beta evolves.

#: A 24h quota allowance cannot produce that number; a plan/seat lock can, and

#: re-evaluated. That response is exactly WRONG for a lock: the item cannot post
#: for another two weeks, so "retry next sweep" means requeueing 49 items every

#: closed days ago. The lock therefore gets `retryable=False` and its own name.

                thing: Buffer answered 429. It defaults False, so every existing
                construction site and every caller keeps its exact behaviour.

                WHY IT HAD TO EXIST. `ok=False` was the only signal, and the
                publisher's one response to it is `transition(iid, "failed")` —
                and `failed` is in outbox._DEAD_STATUSES, so nothing ever picks
                the item up again. A rate limit therefore DELETED the post. Three
                flagship posts died exactly that way on 2026-07-30 ("http_error
                429: Too many requests from this client"), and each was a
                perfectly good post that simply arrived while the shared Buffer
                token was out of quota.

                That risk grows with volume, which this change set increases: the
