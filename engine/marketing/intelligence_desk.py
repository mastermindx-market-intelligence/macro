"""Persistent, evidence-first story packets for the real-time Intelligence Desk.

The press fastlane is an arrival rail. This module turns those arrivals into a
durable newsroom view:

    filtered item -> story packet -> cross-tick merge -> live/intelligence.json

It deliberately does not publish to X. Drafts are review candidates, every
source remains attached, and a score never appears in the public artifact.
SQLite state is host-local and gitignored; the exported JSON is an atomic,
display-tier snapshot served through the registered-user live boundary.

Import closure is stdlib-only so the 75-second daemon and the thin marketing CI
lane can always import it.
