"""engine.marketing.market_facts — Deterministic fact sources for non-ticker content types.

Turns regime/daily_brief/heatmap/confluence artifacts into concrete, checkable
facts that macro/event/watchlist posts can weave in — same shape as chart_facts.py.

Public API:
    macro_facts(root)   -> {facts, numbers_whitelist}
    sector_facts(root)  -> {facts, numbers_whitelist}
    breadth_facts(root) -> {facts, numbers_whitelist}
    event_facts(root)   -> {facts, numbers_whitelist}

All functions:
- Return {"facts": [], "numbers_whitelist": []} on missing files (fail-soft)
- Are deterministic (no RNG, no network)
- Put every number that appears in a fact text into numbers_whitelist
- Never invent numbers — only values actually present in the source artifacts
- Use plain-word language, no indicator vocabulary (MACD/RSI/Stochastic/etc.)

Voice law (MARKETING_VOICE_DOCTRINE_V2 §6): fact TEXT feeds post copy, so it must
translate metrics into plain observable words. NO regime labels ("Goldilocks"), NO
internal scores (growth score / inflation score), NO "(read: ...)" asides, NO em
dashes. Say what the data plainly shows, e.g. "growth data keeps coming in soft while
inflation readings are still warm". If the facts are thin, say less.

DENOMINATOR LAW (Content Studio W1, 2026-07-29)
-----------------------------------------------
`research/MARKETING_CONTENT_STUDIO_LLM_FIRST_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md` §0 gate 3(f)
and §4 ("Jargon at the source"). **A count in a fact string carries its
denominator or it does not ship.** "18 groups on the move today" was generated
here, shipped on the flagship account, and is meaningless: 18 of how many? The
same fact class also carried a MISLABEL — `daily_brief.thematic_line.n_themes`
is the TOTAL number of themes the line tracks, not a count of movers, so
"on the move" was never true of it either.

Two structural rules now:
  1. Every count fact carries a machine-readable ``count`` block
     ``{"n_moving": int|None, "n_tracked": int|None, "noun": str}`` alongside
     its text. The writer translates FIELDS; it never has to parse a number
     back out of prose (masterplan §4).
  2. A count whose denominator is unknown is DROPPED, not phrased around. The
     supply-honest rule applies to facts as much as to volume: a numerator with
     no universe is not a fact, and no digit is better than a false one.

The module also stays clear of desk-machinery vocabulary in fact TEXT: no
screen, board, graded, plan, model, system, or "universe" (a word for our
ticker list, not for anything the reader can see). `tests/test_market_facts.py`
scans this module's string literals to keep it that way.

ANCHOR LAW (operator kill, 2026-08-01)
--------------------------------------
Three macro/event posts were pulled off the queue on the same morning:

    "4 of 11 sectors green on a day growth data firmed and inflation stayed
     warm. Not a clean enough read to lean on yet."
    "Not a clearcut tape. Growth firming a bit, inflation still warm, and only
     4 of 11 sectors managed green. I'm watching, not deciding."
    "growth data firmed a touch while inflation stayed warm. 4 of 11 sectors
     closed green. steady liquidity is the part i'm watching..."

The operator's verdict: "too bland, too weak, no real value, so esoteric no one
knows what it's talking about, zero engagement, people might even report us cuz
only bots/llm write garbage like this."

THE DEFECT IS IN THIS MODULE, NOT IN THE WRITER. Each of those posts is an
honest, in-register rendering of the fact packet it was handed, because the
packet's headline fact was a PRE-BAKED ABSTRACTION. ``_growth_words`` and
``_inflation_words`` turn ``growth_score`` / ``inflation_score`` into "growth
data firmed" and "inflation readings are still warm" — phrases that name no
release, carry no number, and cannot be checked, agreed with, or argued against.
A reader cannot picture "growth data". The denominator law fixed counts that
lacked a universe; this fixes claims that lack a PRINT.

WHAT REPLACES IT. ``data/regime/latest.json`` already carries the actual prints
behind those scores, each with its number and its publisher:

    conditions.labor_nowcast.initial_claims_4wk / claims_yoy_pct  (DOL claims)
    conditions.growth_nowcast.gdpnow                              (Atlanta Fed)
    conditions.inflation_nowcast.median_cpi                       (Cleveland Fed)
    conditions.inflation_nowcast.umich_1y_exp                     (UMich survey)
    liquidity_quality.stress_overlay.hy_oas_pct                   (HY spreads)
    conditions.style_tilt.yield_chg_1m_bp                         (10y, 1m)
    fed_path.policy_rate / fed_path.implied.m12                   (funds futures)
    yield_curve.shape.slope_2s10s.value                           (2s10s)

Those become :func:`named_print_facts`, and the highest-ranked one is FOLDED
into the growth/inflation read (macro) and the driver read (event) so the
packet's own top fact names a print. The abstraction is still allowed to carry
the STANCE ("growth data's firming up a little") — it just may no longer be the
whole claim.

NOTHING IS INVENTED. Every sentence below quotes a field that exists in the
artifact, with the units the producing engine documents (checked against
engine/conditions.py, engine/pit.py's FRED map, engine/yield_curve.py). A field
that is absent, unparseable or degenerate produces NO fact — the honest
degradation is a packet with one fewer anchor, and
``copywriter.anchorless_macro_violations`` then refuses the abstraction-only
post that would have been built from it.

UNITS ARE THE WHOLE GAME HERE, so the two traps found while writing this:
  * ``yield_curve.shape.level`` is the AVERAGE yield across the whole curve
    (engine/yield_curve.py: "parallel height"), NOT the 10-year. It is not used.
  * ``conditions.inflation_nowcast.sticky_ann`` did not read as an annual rate
    on the live artifact (0.23 where the series runs 2-6), so it is not used
    either. ``median_cpi`` is FRED MEDCPIM158SFRBCLE, published as percent
    change at an ANNUAL RATE, and is described as exactly that.

    A DENOMINATOR THE NUMERATOR CANNOT MOVE AGAINST IS NOT A DENOMINATOR
    (2026-07-28: four posts opened "231 of 231 names ... showing bullish
    momentum setups" and then argued "zero triggers" in the next sentence).

    WHAT THE DATA ACTUALLY CARRIES (investigated 2026-07-31 against the live
    site/factordata/tech_confluence.json): ``universe_n`` is 232 and IS the real
    scanned universe — the artifact carries no larger population to promote it
    to. The vacuity is on the NUMERATOR side: ``now`` is keyed by every one of
    those 232 names and counts a name as "active" if ANY of ~100 long combos is
    firing, which on every day observed is all 232. So the fact is structurally
    saturated and there is no denominator repair available; the only honest
    handling is to drop it.

    THE SATURATION GATE IS A BAND, NOT A STRICT INEQUALITY. ``n < universe`` is a
    knife-edge: 231 of 232 clears it and is exactly as vacuous as 232 of 232,
    and one name dropping off the screen was all it took to re-arm the sentence
    this rule exists to kill. So the high arm stays a ratio band.

    THE LOW ARM IS GONE, AND ITS DELETION IS THE POINT (2026-07-31). The gate was
    symmetric — ``ratio <= 0.05`` dropped anything under 5% of the universe — but
    the diagnosed defect was SATURATION ONLY. Symmetry was assumed, not measured,
    and it deleted the most newsworthy prints this lane can produce: "11 of 232
    names" is a washout, and a washout is INFORMATION. 231-of-232 says nothing
    because it cannot be otherwise; 11-of-232 says the screen almost emptied,
    which is rare, checkable, and exactly the kind of concrete fact the voice law
    asks for. A count near zero has a denominator it can move against in both
    directions — it is the opposite of degenerate.

    Two edges survive from the old low arm, and only these two:

      * ``den <= 0`` — no universe. There is nothing to be a fraction OF.
      * ``num <= 0`` — "0 of 232". This is the ONE genuinely empty print: it
        names no members, it reads identically on a day the screen ran and a day
        it silently returned nothing, and it is indistinguishable from the
        lane being broken. A washout has survivors; this has none.

    # growth/inflation read as "{n} groups on the move today", for the stated
    # reason that "a macro post carries a concrete digit". It was two defects at
    # once:
    #   * NO DENOMINATOR. "18 groups on the move" is a numerator with no
    #     universe; the reader cannot tell whether that is broad or narrow.
    #     Masterplan §0 gate 3(f) names this exact string.
    #   * WRONG NOUN AND WRONG VERB. n_themes is the TOTAL count of themes the
    #     thematic line tracks (its own stage_counts sum to it), not a count of
    #     movers, and the themes are not "groups". The sentence was false, not
    #     merely thin.
    # WHAT REPLACES IT. The same fold-in mechanic over a fact that is actually
    # true: the sector board's green count over its universe. A real numerator,
    # a real denominator, a plain noun, and a reader can picture all three.
    # THE FOLD IS GATED ON THE COUNT BEING A READ, NOT A DEFINITION. The clause
    # asserts "closed green", so it may only be built from a numerator that
    # actually counts green sectors AND that says something: 0 of 11 and 11 of 11
    # are both true sentences and neither is a fact a reader learns anything
    # from, and reading a saturated block as "closed green" is how an all-red day
    # shipped as "11 of 11 sectors closed green today." A macro read with no
    # digit is the honest degradation; the module's own denominator law already
    # says a count that cannot be stated properly does not ship.
    # THE BREADTH READ IS CLOCK-GATED (operator defect class C, 2026-08-02).
    # Two failures, both visible in the six-post "4 of 11 sectors green" family
    # that shipped across four desks over the weekend of 2026-08-01:
    #
    #   * "closed green TODAY" was a hardcoded word. Written at 23:51 ET Friday
    #     it is true; the same sentence written at 17:49 ET Saturday — which is
    #     when the second weekend run produced three of those six posts — is a
    #     lie about a day on which nothing traded. The word now comes from
    #     market_clock, which asks the exchange calendar instead of guessing.
    #   * AN INDECISIVE READ IS NOT A REASON FOR A POST. `_is_vacuous_count`
    #     already refuses saturation (0 of 11, 11 of 11) as a definition rather
    #     than a fact. It has no opinion about 4 of 11, which is the other way a
    #     breadth number says nothing: the tape did not lean. On a day with no
    #     session that is a stale number with nothing to add, so it does not
    #     ship at all; on a session day it ships WITH a stance tail keyed to the
    #     fact kind, because the operator's complaint was six interchangeable
