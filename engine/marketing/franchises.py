"""engine/marketing/franchises.py — the franchise register + slot scheduler (XG-W3).

A FRANCHISE is a recurring format a reader can expect from one account: Cici's
"Before New York Wakes", Kelly's "Confirmation Check", the flagship's "What
Changed Since Yesterday". The editorial constitution §12 names them; the four
employee specs (`config/personas/<id>.yml` `franchises:`) carry them as PROSE.
This module is the STRUCTURED register those prose lines describe — the thing an
engine can actually schedule against.

WHY A CODE REGISTER AND NOT THE YAML.  The spec's `franchises:` entries are
human sentences ("Tea and Tickers — lighter roundup, ≤1/week and parked while
the canon is dark"). They carry no kind, no window, no cap a scheduler can read.
Rather than re-shape a frozen XG-W1 schema, the register lives here as a
declarative table and `spec_drift()` cross-checks it against the committed specs,
so the two can never silently diverge. Adding a franchise is an edit to _REGISTER
plus (for an employee) a matching prose line in the spec.

NO NEW KINDS (charter §4 / XG-W3 brief).  Every franchise maps onto a kind that
`content_studio.CONTENT_TYPES` and `outbox.KINDS` already admit. The franchise id
travels in item metadata (`item["source"]["franchise"]`), never as a kind. This is
deliberate: a new kind would need a tilt weight on every persona spec, a dial
level, a template pool and a sentinel cap — a franchise needs none of that,
because it IS one of those kinds with a house format.

SLOTS ARE WINDOWS, NOT QUOTAS (constitution Law 1 — value before activity).
`open_slots()` answers "which franchise windows are open for this account right
now". It never manufactures an obligation to post. An open slot with nothing
worth saying ABSTAINS, and `abstain()` records why (§16.5's reason taxonomy) so
the bottleneck is visible: if every Mood-vs-Money slot dies on
`no_measured_input`, the fix is a sentiment source (XG-W5), not a looser bar.

CALENDAR SCOPE — A WEEKDAY CLOCK, NOT A TRADING CALENDAR (review F4).
`sessions_only=True` keeps a session-clocked franchise (Cici's pre-open read,
Kelly's "Confirmation Check") from opening on a Saturday, because a franchise
whose whole premise is "what the session did" has nothing to say when there was
no session. It is a WEEKDAY test and nothing more: it does not know about
exchange holidays, half-days, Golden Week, Thanksgiving, or an unscheduled
close. A HOLIDAY CALENDAR IS EXPLICITLY OUT OF SCOPE for XG-W3 — wiring one
means picking a per-exchange source and a staleness policy, which is its own
build. Until then a holiday Monday opens a slot the desk should decline, and
declining it is an editorial abstention (`facts_too_stale` / `no_unique_edge`),
not a scheduler guarantee.

DISPLAY NAMES ARE METADATA, NOT COPY.  Sophia's "Narrative Shift" contains
"narrative", which is on the copywriter's `_BANNED_WORD_BOUNDARY` list — a post
that used the franchise's own name verbatim would be rejected by the house
vocab guard. `copy_safe_name` records this per franchise and the prompt contract
never instructs verbatim use of an unsafe name. The register is greppable
internal structure; the reader sees the FORMAT, not the label.
