"""engine.marketing.wire_voice — the PRESS-FEEDS wire copy voice pass (B2-COPY).

D05 Addendum 2 §3 (copy law) + §7 (B2-COPY charter). This module owns the parts
that make a wire post DISTINCTIVE rather than a generic summarize-with-citation:

  1. Rotating OPENER pool (§3 seed list), selected DETERMINISTICALLY (hash of item
     id -> index) with a per-account no-repeat window so two consecutive posts on
     the same account never lead with the same hook. Openers are class-aware
     (a geopolitical flash gets a graver hook than a crypto flash) and OPTIONAL per
     item class (a direct quote may lead with the speaker, no manufactured hook).

  2. Key-phrase selection LAW injected into the LLM prompt — quote the source's
     own strongest SHORT phrase verbatim-in-quotes, paraphrase the rest. The LLM
     may only restate facts present in the source; the numbers whitelist stays in
     breaking_summary.validate_summary.

  3. AI-tell lexicon applied to wire summaries — the rev-4 press validators' list,
     IMPORTED (never forked): the phrase list from config/press.yml
     validators.ai_tell_phrases + the two pattern rules from engine.press.validators
     (Moreover-opener, not-only-but-also budget). A copy here would drift the day
     someone adds a phrase upstream.

  4. Model tiering: sonnet-class above a salience threshold, haiku below — resolved
     through the same config keys build_breaking_payload reads, so a disarmed /
     keyless run still lands on the deterministic fallback in breaking_summary.

IMPORT CLOSURE: stdlib only at module import (hashlib, re). yaml + the validators
regexes are imported LAZILY inside functions so the thin marketing-engine CI lane
(pytest + pyyaml, no pandas) stays green and collection never pulls a heavy tree.

# Opener pools (§3 seed list, grown by register class). Front-facing hooks only —
# no internal state/study names, no untranslated stats, no raw slugs (glance-tier

# ATTRIBUTION LAW (2026-07-31 postmortem — a FABRICATED DATELINE SHIPPED LIVE).
#
# This pool used to hold four hooks that ASSERT who said a thing or where it was
# said: "🚨 TRUMP:", "TRUMP:", "🇺🇸 TRUMP:" and "White House, minutes ago:". The
# pool was mapped to BOTH the `people` and the `markets` registers, and
# derive_register returns `markets` for every ordinary wire story — so the hook
# was drawn by hash from a pool whose contents had nothing to do with the item's
# source. On 2026-07-31 a MarketWatch story about three Fed dissenters posted on
# the flagship datelined "White House, minutes ago:". That is a fabricated
# attribution on a finance account: nobody at the White House said it, and the
# item had never been near a White House feed.
#
# The rule now: an opener that names a SPEAKER or a VENUE is a dateline, and a
# dateline is a factual claim about provenance. It may attach ONLY to an item
# whose own source IS that speaker/venue (see `source_provenance`). Ordinary wire
# items draw from non-attributive pools, which say only what is true of every
# item on this lane — that it just crossed a wire.
#
# Enforcement is belt AND braces: the pools below are separated by provenance,
# AND `select_opener` filters any attributive opener out of a pool the item's
# provenance does not license — which also covers a `wire.opener_pools` config
# override that re-introduces one.

# Default / markets-macro register. NON-ATTRIBUTIVE by construction: every hook
# here is a statement about the wire ("this just crossed"), which is true of
# every item this lane processes, and about nothing else.

    consecutive posts on the same account never share a hook, while selection
    stays a pure function of (id, recent_openers).

    BATCH VARIETY, NOT JUST ADJACENT VARIETY (2026-08-02). This used to compare
    against `recent[-1]` ALONE — the whole window was recorded and only its last
    entry was ever read (`_RECENT_OPENERS_KEEP = 3` with a comment saying "only
    [-1] gates"). Avoiding one hook out of a five-hook pool lets a busy hour
    alternate A, B, A, B and read as two templates taking turns, which is what a
    reader of four posts inside one hour actually sees. The walk now scores every
    candidate by how long ago the account last used it and takes the stalest,

      * LEADING NON-LETTERS ARE PRESERVED, IN PLACE. Real posts carry flags and
        sirens on either side of the hook. "JUST IN: 🇺🇸🇮🇷 US CENTCOM..." keeps
        its flags (they sit after the hook and simply become the new head);
        "🚨 BREAKING: text" -> "🚨 text" (they sit before it and are carried

      * NEVER EMPTIES A BODY. A body that is nothing but a hook is returned
        unchanged; deleting it would hand the composer a bald opener with no
        sentence behind it, which is worse than the doubled hook.
