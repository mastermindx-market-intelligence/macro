"""engine.marketing.chart_director — THE chart-spec builder for post charts.

TrendSpider hardening PR-C (masterplan §3). Every chart-family lane calls this
module instead of assembling its own ``render_chart_v2`` kwargs. Before it,
nine call sites each carried their own literal block — daily, 90 bars,
``indicators=("volume","macd")``, no annotations — and the drift between them
was invisible because no two were ever read side by side. The renderer grew a
whole annotation grammar in PR-A that no call site could reach.

  INPUT   {ticker, angle, fact(s), timeframe hint}
  OUTPUT  a validated :class:`ChartSpec` whose ``kwargs`` splat straight into
          ``chart_render.render_chart_v2``

THE DOCTRINE TABLE (masterplan §3 PR-C.1). One claim kind, one chart:

  level touch / reclaim   that ONE moving average, a blue-grey disc per prior
                          touch, a gold disc on now, a level tag in the MA's
                          own colour. Daily.
  streak / superlative    the streak sub-pane (its y-unit IS the claim's unit)
                          or a weekly chart with the record bars boxed.
  analog                  weekly/monthly, log above four years, blue-grey discs
                          on each prior instance and gold on now.
  volume event            a real volume PANE plus the volume profile, with a
                          callout scoped to the window the fact measured.
  breakout / breakdown    trendline or zone band plus a measure box from the
                          break bar.
  stage read              WEEKLY, the 30-week average, a stage callout. The
                          CHART LABEL may say "Stage 2"; the COPY says "marking
                          up" (§0 gate 5 — show the indicator, don't say it).
  post-event drift        the average price paid since the event anchor plus a
                          measure box. We have this and the corpus does not.
  valuation observation   a zone band at the reference lows plus a callout.

WHAT THE DIRECTOR ENFORCES, in code, on every spec it returns:

  * **≤1 moving average.** The corpus draws one, labelled inline in its own
    colour, and never a legend box.
  * **≤2 sub-panes.** The renderer caps this too; the director caps it earlier
    so a spec that would have been silently truncated is instead never built.
  * **≤3 annotation FAMILIES.** Read the masterplan's "≤3 annotation objects"
    against its own doctrine table and the literal reading self-destructs: the
    level-touch row orders a disc per prior touch PLUS a gold disc PLUS a level
    tag, which is six objects for a five-touch name, and ref-27/ref-25 in the
    committed reference pack both draw five discs. What the corpus never does
    is mix more than a few KINDS of ink on one canvas. So the cap counts
    distinct families (spotlights / zones / trendlines / arcs / measure box) and
    the per-family object counts are bounded separately —
    :data:`MAX_SPOTLIGHTS` and friends. Level tags are excluded from the count
    on purpose: an axis tag is the in-frame RESTATEMENT device, not a mark on
    the canvas, and capping it would defeat §0 gate 5.
  * **The claim-window law (§0 gate 2).** A fact's full evidence window must lie
    inside the plotted axis. The director widens ``lookback_bars`` first, and
    if the widest permitted window still cannot cover the claim it REFUSES the
    fact and tries the next one. This is the inverse of the documented corpus
    failure — three of thirteen sampled charts assert "ever" on an axis that
    starts last year — and it is enforced here, not requested in a prompt.
  * **PIT discipline (§0 gate 3).** Facts come from the same split-adjusted
    daily parquet the chart plots; a short or null history yields no spec.
  * **Volume profile ON by default** for chart-family posts.
  * **The forming-bar law.** The chart PLOTS the live weekly/monthly bar
    (``resample_bars`` keeps it); every fact was computed on COMPLETED bars
    (``chart_facts.resample_completed`` drops it). The two series differ by one
    bar, so fact anchors are mapped to chart bars BY DATE — never by index —
    in :func:`_index_of_date`.

A7 / display tier: nothing here originates a signal, a score or a ranking. It
selects a pre-computed deterministic fact and decides how to DRAW it.

    *marker_date* is a DATE, not an index, for the same reason fact anchors are:
    the director chooses its own window and timeframe, so an index computed
    against some other caller's 90-bar daily load would point at an unrelated
    bar here. An out-of-window marker date resolves to no marker rather than to
    a clamped one — a SETUP pill on the wrong candle is worse than none.

    The fact walk is a LADDER, not a lookup: the highest-salience fact the angle
    prefers is tried first, and a fact refused by the claim-window law falls
    through to the next one. Only when every fact is refused does the director
    fall back to an un-annotated tape card — which is still a chart, and still
