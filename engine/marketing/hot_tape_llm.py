"""engine.marketing.hot_tape_llm — Hot Tape Phase 2: the LLM wire desk.

Program: **Hot Tape** (``research/MARKETING_HOT_TAPE_MASTERPLAN.md``), §3.3
"Wire copy layer", acceptance gates 0.2 (differentiating stat), 0.3 (facts are
engine-computed) and 0.4 (observations, not calls).

WHAT THIS IS
------------
The radar (Phase 1) detects an intraday event, computes every number into a
FactPacket, and renders a deterministic wire template from it. This module is
the OPTIONAL phrasing pass on top of that: it hands the packet to the shared
provider waterfall and asks a model to *phrase* the same facts in the corpus's
wire register. The deterministic template text is passed IN as an argument, so
this module never imports the radar — the dependency points one way only
(radar → hot_tape_llm), and Phase 1 can land before or after this file.

EPISTEMICS LAW (masterplan gate 0.3; CLAUDE.md §Epistemics)
-----------------------------------------------------------
**The engine computes, the model phrases, the LLM never originates a number.**
Every number-like token in the model's output must resolve to a number the
engine already put in the packet (``numeric_violations``). A model that invents,
extends, or "helpfully" re-rounds a figure is rejected and the deterministic
template posts instead. The model likewise never originates a *call*: gate 0.4
bans entry/exit/sizing language outright (``call_violations``), and gate 0.2's
wire register bans hedging (``hedge_violations``) — the corpus's 95-view flop
was hedged and stat-free while its 614K twin was neither.

A dropped post does not exist as an outcome, and an unchecked LLM post does not
exist as an outcome: ``phrase_or_fallback`` ALWAYS returns postable text — the
model's phrasing when it clears every gate, the caller's deterministic template
otherwise — and never raises.

IMPORT-CLOSURE LAW
------------------
**stdlib only at module import.** ``engine.llm_auth``, ``anthropic``, ``yaml``,
``lib.config``, ``engine.marketing.copywriter``, ``social_publisher`` and
``wire_voice`` are ALL imported lazily inside functions. The marketing-engine CI
lane installs pytest + pyyaml + jinja2 and nothing else — no ``anthropic``, no
pandas — so a top-level ``import anthropic`` here turns that lane red at
COLLECTION, before a single test runs. The lazy imports are the contract, not a
style preference; ``tests/test_marketing_hot_tape_llm.py`` scans this file's
source to pin it.

THE FactPacket CONTRACT
-----------------------
A flat-ish dict of engine-computed facts. Every key is OPTIONAL — this module
tolerates any subset and treats unknown numeric keys as admissible facts (the
engine computed them; an unknown key is not an error). Canonical keys:

===========================  ===========================================
``cashtag``                  primary cashtag, e.g. ``"$SNDK"``
``cashtags``                 list of every cashtag the copy may use
``name``                     display name, e.g. ``"SanDisk"``
``trigger``                  detector id (see ``SINGLE_NAME_TRIGGERS``)
``as_of``                    ISO timestamp of the tape read
``direction``                ``"up"`` / ``"down"``
``pct_day``                  today's move, display-rounded by the engine
``pct_5d`` / ``window_days`` multi-day move and the window it spans
``pct_from_high``            distance from the record/52w high
``dollar_change_abs``        dollar translation, e.g. ``2.0e11``
``streak_days``              consecutive same-direction sessions
``streak_rarity_years``      how far back a streak this long last happened
``price`` / ``level``        live price; the level that was crossed
``since_date`` / ``high_date``  ``"YYYY-MM-DD"`` anchors for the "since" device
``sector``                   sector name (sector packets)
``median_pct``               sector median move
``breadth_down`` / ``breadth_total``  sector breadth counts
``movers``                   ``[{"cashtag": "$NVDA", "pct": -6.1}, ...]``
``extra_numbers``            list of further engine-computed floats
``link``                     canonical URL for the event, when there is one
===========================  ===========================================

Numbers are read RECURSIVELY from the whole dict, including numbers embedded in
strings (dates, ``"$5T"``), so a packet key this module has never heard of still
licenses its own numbers. Display rounding is the ENGINE's job: the packet
carries what the copy is allowed to say.

The engine computes. You phrase. You never originate a number.

LAWS
1. ALLOWED NUMBERS: use ONLY numbers from the ALLOWED NUMBERS list in the user message, verbatim as they are given. Never compute a new one, never extend one, never round one further, never add a number of your own. Every number you write must appear in that list.
2. Declarative and unhedged. The numbers carry the drama, so state them flat. Never say something seems, looks like, might, may be, could be, or probably.
3. No advice and no calls. Nothing that tells the reader to do anything — no buying, selling, entries, exits, targets, sizing or positions. You report the tape.
4. Zoom out when the packet has the layers: today's move, then the multi-day move, then the distance from the high, then the dollar translation.
5. Use the "since <date>" quantifiers and the streak counts the packet gives you. That is the differentiating stat and it is the whole product. A bare percent-move post is the flop case.
6. Live markers where the packet says they are true: "today", "right now". Never write so far today: inside the session today already means it, and a validator rejects the longer form. BREAKING and ALL-CAPS sparingly — wire register, not shouting.
7. No hashtags. No emoji. Cashtags: use exactly the cashtags the packet lists. For a single-name item the primary cashtag appears exactly once.
8. {SOFT_CHAR_CAP} characters maximum. The hard cap is 280 — leave the headroom.
9. Output the post text only. No JSON, no quotes around it, no preamble, no sign-off.

HOUSE EXEMPLARS — this is the register:
1. {HOUSE_EXEMPLARS[0]}
2. {HOUSE_EXEMPLARS[1]}
3. {HOUSE_EXEMPLARS[2]}

NEVER THIS:
{ANTI_EXEMPLAR}
