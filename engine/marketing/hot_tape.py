"""engine.marketing.hot_tape — Hot Tape detectors, FactPacket, intraday state.

Implements research/MARKETING_HOT_TAPE_MASTERPLAN.md §3.2 (attention radar,
v1 detectors) and §3.3 (FactPacket: typed, all numbers engine-computed).

The radar loop is: live quotes + the nightly context pack (hot_tape_pack.py)
-> :func:`detect_events` -> :func:`engine.marketing.hot_tape_wire.compose_wire`
-> outbox item. This module owns the middle step and nothing else: it is PURE
(no I/O in the detectors), deterministic, and makes zero LLM calls. Masterplan
gate 0.3 — "the copy layer may phrase, never originate" — starts here: every
number a post may use is a leaf of ``FactPacket.facts``.

Import discipline (gate 0.6): module-level imports are STDLIB ONLY. yaml is
imported lazily in :func:`load_config`, the jsonl helpers lazily in the ring /
fired accessors, and pandas is never imported at all. The radar workflow runs
on a shallow ubuntu checkout with pyyaml+requests only.

Bridge honesty (masterplan §1, "this stale data issue is so serious"): the
daily price store can lag the live tape. :func:`bridge_ok` reports whether the
pack's trade_date is adjacent to today's session; when it is False every
history-dependent fact (streaks, records, ATH distance, correction/bear
thresholds, RSI) is SUPPRESSED rather than quietly computed against a stale
anchor. The bridge is GLOBAL, so a second, per-record gate rides with it: a
record whose own ``last_date`` lags the pack's tip gets no history facts either
(26 live-quoted laggards sat in the shipped pack, one carrying a "5-day streak"
that had ended six sessions earlier).

Round-number crosses need no history and survive both gates. MCAP MILESTONES
DO NOT: their share count is only trustworthy when the reference's ``asof`` and
the price store's tip are the same date, so ``shares_est`` is None otherwise
and the milestone branch simply never fires (a 2026-07-27 market cap divided by
a 2026-07-02 close inflated JPM's shares 6.5% and manufactured a "$1 trillion"
cross at an actual $942B).

Public API:
    FactPacket                         — the typed fact contract
    load_config(root) / load_pack(root)
    in_window(now, cfg) / session_phase(now) / quotes_fresh(live, now, cfg)
    bridge_ok(pack, now)
    load_ring / append_ring / compact_ring / cross_memory_row
    load_fired / append_fired
    detect_events(...) -> list[FactPacket]
    brief_key(alert_key) / build_brief_packet(alert_row, ...) -> FactPacket | None
    severity_account(packet, cfg) -> str
    live_account(candidate, ...) -> str          — liveness + volume, one address
    live_desk_verdict(candidate, ...) -> DeskVerdict  — ditto, with .parked
    packet_to_source(packet, media) -> dict

Never-raise contract: every public function returns None / [] / {} plus one log
line on internal error. Nothing here raises at a seam.

    IT NO LONGER RESCUES A DARK DESK'S VOLUME ONTO A LIVE ONE (W5, 2026-08-03).
    The original contract was "``candidate`` if desk_network has it armed, else
    the first armed fallback", and it was written against a real grave: 29 items
    on 2026-07-30/31 were rendered (a Chrome raster), phrased (an LLM call),
    uploaded to R2 and enqueued, then quarantined at dispatch with reason
    ``account_disabled`` — every one of them addressed to ``mastermind_news``
    while that desk was dark.

    THE RESCUE WAS THE RIGHT ANSWER TO THE WRONG QUESTION. It treated a dark
    desk's traffic as something to be SAVED, and the only desk with room to save
    it was the brand account — so one switch position silently made
    @mastermindx001 the destination for the whole tape firehose. What the
    operator then saw is the measured consequence: 11 ``kind="breaking"`` items
    on ``flagship`` in a single day, four of them from one Fed appearance inside
    an hour. A grave is a cost; a firehose on the brand account is a product
    failure, and between the two the grave is cheaper. So the DEFAULT is now to
    PARK: the item keeps its rightful owner's address, ``wire_routing`` counts
    it (:func:`wire_routing.park_census`) and announces it once, and the
    publisher's dispatch-time park records it where the admin can see it.

    TWO WAYS BACK, BOTH EXPLICIT AND BOTH OFF BY DEFAULT:
      * ``wire_routing.dark_desk.policy: redirect`` restores the old behaviour
        wholesale, for an operator who genuinely wants it;
      * ``wire_routing.dark_desk.severity_exception`` lets ONE genuinely huge
        single event through on a live desk. ``severity`` is what opens it, and
        a caller that passes none can never reach it by accident.

    VOLUME IS CHECKED EVEN WHEN THE DESK IS LIVE. Liveness says a desk may take
    items; the rolling ``kind="breaking"`` ceiling says how many. A candidate at
    its ceiling hands the item to another DECLARED wire desk with headroom, and
    when none has headroom the candidate keeps it — this function returns an
    address, so it cannot refuse; :func:`live_desk_verdict` is the caller-facing
    form that can say ``parked``.

    Resolution goes through ``wire_routing`` — the SAME liveness read, policy and
    ceiling the press wire uses, deliberately not a second implementation,
    because two answers to "may this desk take this" is how a routing table
    starts lying.

    THREE ANSWERS, NOT TWO, on liveness: unknown (the accounts model could not be
    consulted) and empty (no ``desk_network`` roster at all) are NOT evidence
    that ``candidate`` is dark, so both leave it untouched and print nothing.

    Never raises.
