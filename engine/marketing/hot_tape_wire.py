"""engine.marketing.hot_tape_wire — Wire copy for Hot Tape events.

Implements research/MARKETING_HOT_TAPE_MASTERPLAN.md §2.D (the device library)
and §3.3 (wire copy layer), under gates 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4:

* **0.2 differentiating stat** — every post carries at least one §2.D device: a
  "since <date>", a streak count, a dollar translation, or a record/rank. The
  bank is (template, required device slots); a variant renders only when every
  slot it needs is derivable from the FactPacket, and a family whose device law
  cannot be met REFUSES (``compose_wire`` returns None). A bare "%-move" post
  is the corpus's 95-view flop and is structurally impossible here.
* **0.3 facts are engine-computed** — :func:`check_text_numbers` re-reads the
  RENDERED text and rejects any numeric token that is not a leaf of
  ``packet.facts`` rendered through the shared formatters. compose_wire runs
  this itself, so the gate holds at runtime and not only in tests.
* **0.4 observations, not calls** — :data:`WIRE_BANNED` word-boundary scan over
  both the static bank and every rendered variant. Directive call language on
  an un-gauntleted read is the Mag-7 killed class (research/DO_NOT_REBUILD.md).
  Cashtags are stripped before the scan so the ticker $LONG cannot be read as
  the word "long".

Import discipline (gate 0.6): STDLIB ONLY at module level. Voice (§2): wire
tone, declarative, numbers carry the drama, no hedging, no hype adjectives, no
"BREAKING", no hashtags, no links, no emoji. ASCII hyphens only, never an em
dash. Ticker display names are deliberately never rendered: "3M" would inject a
digit that belongs to no fact.

#: The ONLY fact keys forwarded to the LLM desk (M6). An ALLOWLIST, because the
#: fact dict is written by nine detectors and read by one gate that treats every
#: number it can reach as admissible: `severity` and `provenance` were kept out
#: by name, and everything a detector added afterwards walked straight in.
#:
#: The live example is the two-step brief. Its facts carry `alert_key`
#: ("mover:MU:down:2026-07-29T14:05:00Z:0"), so 2026, 29, 14 and 05 were all
#: licensed figures — a model could write "up 14" on a stock that moved 8% and
#: clear gate 0.3 against an internal id. Counters and stamps that no clause
#: renders (`prev_close`, `threshold_px`, `report_date`, `signal_id`,
#: `refire_ratio`, `quote_ts_ms`, the `earn_next_*` pair) are out for the same
#: reason: the model's job is to PHRASE the facts the template renders, and a
#: number it cannot show is a number it cannot invent.
#:
#: The list is the union of every key the slot builders in this module read.
#: `test_the_llm_packet_forwards_every_key_a_clause_renders` recomputes that
#: union from the source and fails when a new device outgrows this constant.
