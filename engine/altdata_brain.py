"""Alt-Data Brain — Claude-Opus convergence analyst (GATED · OAuth · falsifiable).

The deep-reasoning half of the Signal Intelligence desk. It reads the DETERMINISTIC
substrate (weighted convergence by_ticker + the influence graph + bill catalysts) as an
EVIDENCE PACK and asks Claude Opus the judgement a transparent score cannot make:

  * WHY do these independent data points align on this name (or not)?
  * what are the SECOND / THIRD-ORDER beneficiaries of the affiliation/flow?
  * a DIRECTIONAL lean + CONVICTION + an ACTION (ACCUMULATE / WATCH / AVOID), each with a
    machine-checkable FALSIFIER scored vs SPY.

EXTRACTOR + JUDGE, NOT ORACLE. Reason only from the evidence pack; cite the channel/actor
behind each call. Output is FALSIFIABLE and logged to a ledger (data/altdata/
brain_theses.jsonl), graded vs SPY by the EXACT engine.ai_desk_scorer evaluators, and the
track record is fed back into the next prompt to calibrate conviction.

DE-ESCALATION-ONLY LAW (_reconcile): the LLM output is CLAMPED so it can only move DOWN
the action/conviction/lean ladders, never up. A DETERMINISTIC BASELINE is computed from
the cluster's own deterministic fields (weighted_score, extended, rs_vs_spy_60d, channels)
— NEVER from any LLM-proposed field (t.*):
  - Directional witness (deterministic):
      (a) If rs_vs_spy_60d is present: rs >= 0 → deterministic overweight; rs < 0 →
          deterministic underweight (price trend is the witness).
      (b) If rs_vs_spy_60d is None: look for a bullish channel witness in the cluster's
          channels list (_BULLISH_WITNESS_CHANNELS). If at least one is present →
          deterministic overweight.
      (c) If rs_vs_spy_60d is None AND no bullish channel witness → ceiling = WATCH,
          conviction ceiling = "low"; the LLM's lean is preserved as a display lean but
          ACTION and CONVICTION cannot exceed that ceiling.
  - Action ceiling: ACCUMULATE only when deterministic lean == "overweight" AND
    weighted_score >= min_weighted AND NOT extended; otherwise WATCH (overweight) or
    AVOID (non-overweight).
  - Conviction ceiling: "medium" when deterministic lean == "overweight" AND
    weighted_score >= min_weighted; "low" otherwise.

  INVARIANT: the ACTION and CONVICTION ceilings are a function of deterministic fields
  ONLY (rs_vs_spy_60d, channels, weighted_score, extended) — NEVER of any LLM-proposed
  field (t.lean, t.action, t.conviction).

The LLM may de-escalate further (e.g. lower conviction to "low", demote to WATCH) but
may NEVER raise above the deterministic ceiling. The existing hard blocks (ACCUMULATE on
extended → WATCH; ACCUMULATE on bearish lean → AVOID) remain as additional guardrails.

This desk EMITS an actionable scored axis (per the desk's mandate) that the Mastermind bot
consumes — but the bot still applies its own risk framework on top; the ledger keeps the
axis honest. AUTH: Claude via the user's Claude-Code OAuth token (Bearer + oauth beta
header), ANTHROPIC_API_KEY fallback. No token → graceful no-op (degraded artifact).
