"""Risk Radar v2 — a regime-typed, EVIDENCE-GATED, genuinely-leading market-risk engine.

WHY THIS REPLACES risk_state v1
-------------------------------
A 68-event backtest (research/RISK_ENGINE_V2_FINDINGS.md) proved the v1 composite
REACTS: its one real edge (the abs>=60 band, 2.9x lift 2006-2019) is DEAD in the
modern era (0.68x in 2020-2026) — overfit to the old regime — and its keystone
breadth leg self-cancels the instant price drops. Re-scoring ~20 candidates under a
STRICT bar (day-level forward lift + frequency-matched permutation + a 2020+ holdout)
killed the popular signals (VIX-term ROC, SKEW, VVIX, put/call-proxy, VRP = noise).

ONLY a handful survive, and they cluster by SCARE PHYSICS — which is why this engine
is REGIME-TYPED. Each scare-type's sub-score is built ONLY from signals that passed
the strict bar, weighted by their measured 2020+ lift:

  credit   — HY OAS 21d ROC (raw spread velocity; 1.94x, ERA-ROBUST. NB the credit
             *composite* drawdown_risk LAGS; the raw ROC leads — different things).
  rates    — MOVE (rate-vol) level (1.83x in 2020+; regime-dependent).
  bubble   — SPY parabolicity (dist > 200dma) + leadership concentration (SMH/SPY);
             2.06x in 2020+ — the strongest MODERN-era precursor (the 2026-06 case).
  growth   — defensives outperforming (XLU/SPY) + cyclical/defensive rolldown
             (XLY/XLP); 1.7-1.9x in 2020+.
  vol      — VIX9D/VIX3M term level (WEAK, 1.44x) — the only backtestable vol leg.
             The genuinely-leading vol/positioning precursors (put/call, dealer GEX,
             implied correlation) are NOT in deep history yet -> Tier-B (display +
             escalator-only) until their collectors accrue, then gated like the rest.

HONESTY: the surviving edge is MODEST — ~1.5-2x conditional lift, not a forecast.
Elevated => ~20-26% chance of a >=8% drawdown onset within ~3 weeks vs ~12% base,
with real false positives. So the engine is LOUD + EARLY (high recall, by request)
but every alert carries its MEASURED lift/lead, a forward-outcome log grades every
call, and an Opus review loop (engine/risk_radar_review.py) retunes the thresholds
from its own mistakes. The de-risk response is SIZING, not selection. The validated
regime quad is untouched.

All signals are CAUSAL/leak-free (trailing-window percentiles). No public function
raises into the build.

    For backtest + history. Renormalizes over available legs.

    display_only legs are INCLUDED here, deliberately — see §15 of
    research/REGIME_DISLOCATION_RECAL_PROPOSAL.md.

    The 2026-07-29 audit is right that the VSB W6 contract ("STRUCTURALLY UNABLE to move scare
    tier until gauntlet-promoted") is enforced only in _tierb_can_escalate, so an un-promoted
    leg still sets the DISPLAYED number, and that it does so in the calming direction: a quiet
    display_only leg at 0.0 carries full weight in the mean, so 'vol' prints 22.4 while its one
    graded leg (vix_term) sits at pctile 0.67.

    Excluding them was implemented and REVERTED the same day, because renormalizing is not
    free: 'vol' registers 3 legs and only vix_term resolves today (weight_coverage 0.5 —
    vol_putcall/vol_gex are still accruing). Dropping corr_floor_break renormalizes half the
    scare's registered evidence to full confidence, and the band cuts were never calibrated on
    that composition. Measured effect on the live stores: vol 22.4 -> 67.3, Tier-B escalates,
    market_state severe_gated True, ceiling 56 -> 40, US verdict MIXED -> RISK_OFF — an
    authority-tier flip resting on ONE unvalidated leg reading BELOW its own thr_pct 0.90
    (lift_2020 0.44, era_robust False). That is originating an escalation, not fixing a bug.

    The defect is disclosed instead: weight_coverage / partial_composition / n_legs_resolved
    and the display_only_legs payload block let a surface say "this scare is running on half
    its evidence, and a leg the doctrine silences is holding the number down." The fix itself
    is pre-registered with acceptance gates for the gauntlet."""
