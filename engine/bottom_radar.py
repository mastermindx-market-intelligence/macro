"""Bottom-formation radar (engine v2, anticipation tier) — a single point-in-time
0-100 raw score that a name's forward outcome is a DURABLE bottom (not a dead-cat
bounce), built to be FORWARDED to the top of the watchlist BEFORE price confirms.

HONESTY CONTRACT (research/ANTICIPATION_ENGINE_DESIGN.md): our own measurements show
entry timing has NEGATIVE forward-return correlation — anticipation is a DRAWDOWN /
capital-efficiency lever, NOT a return-alpha lever. So this score is a pure ENTRY /
watchlist-ORDERING overlay; it MUST NOT touch the cross-sectional selection rank. The
raw score here is mapped to a probability ONLY by a fitted calibration curve
(scripts/calibrate_bottom_radar.py) — raw weights are NOT probabilities — and the
PRIMED tier earns a starter SIZE only if calibration proves positive expectancy net of
the stop; otherwise it is watchlist-ordering display-only.

Reuses the existing leading machinery (engine.cycles early_signals / rsi_divergence /
bottom_confidence / washout, engine.velocity deterioration) and adds the legs that were
missing: graded divergence, volatility contraction, relative-strength holding, and (for
the volume-bearing deep names) a capitulation->dry-up signature. Every input is causal
(<= as_of); truncate-and-recompute == full at a past date.
