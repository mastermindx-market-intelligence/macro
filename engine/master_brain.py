"""Master brain — cross-asset macro SYNTHESIS (LLM Tier-B).

LEAF · GATED · DEFAULT-OFF · RESEARCH/CONTEXT-ONLY. Reads the DETERMINISTIC
outputs of the dashboards and asks a reasoning LLM to synthesize the picture a
single panel can't. Three LENSES share one engine:
  • macro — the cross-asset read across every dashboard (macro/China/HK/commodity/
    forex/BTC) + the catalyst digest  → data/regime/master_brief.json
  • china — a China & Hong-Kong focused read (US macro / dollar / global liquidity /
    commodities as backdrop)          → data/regime/china_brief.json
  • btc   — a Bitcoin focused read (cycle / valuation / leverage / on-chain / ETF
    flows / macro-liquidity backdrop)  → data/regime/btc_brief.json
Each writes a SEPARATE artifact and a site/ copy the dashboard panel fetches.

This is the analyst's morning note. It NEVER feeds a score, signal, or allocation;
nothing in the scoring path imports it. It READS the engine's outputs and writes a
SEPARATE artifact. Every public function returns plain data or None and never
raises into the pipeline.

Runs on DeepSeek V4 Pro via its Anthropic-compatible endpoint by default — one
config line (`llm_model` / `llm_base_url` / `api_key_env`) swaps it to Claude Opus.
NOTE: unlike the Tier-A digest (public docs only), the brain necessarily sends the
user's DERIVED market-state summary (regime labels, scores, conflicts — NOT
holdings or watchlist composition) to the provider. Swap to a first-party model in
config if that matters.

    reads ``api_key_env`` as the ANTHROPIC key and ``deepseek_key_env`` as
    DeepSeek's. Handing this cfg over untranslated would build an
    anthropic.Anthropic() against api.anthropic.com holding a DeepSeek key — a
    rung that 401s on every call and burns a waterfall step to do it.

    THE LEGACY KEYS ARE ONLY INHERITED WHEN THEY ACTUALLY DESCRIBE DEEPSEEK.
    `_is_deepseek_lane` accepts a lane on the base URL *or* the key name, so a
    PARTIALLY swapped config — the documented one-line Opus swap done to
    `api_key_env`/`llm_model` but not `llm_base_url` — reaches here mixed. Blind
    `or cfg["api_key_env"]` fallbacks would then hand the operator's ANTHROPIC
    key to `deepseek_key_env` and ship it to api.deepseek.com, which is the
    mirror image of the collision above and strictly worse: the first merely
    401s, this one transmits a live credential to a third party. Each legacy key
    is therefore inherited only if it is DeepSeek-shaped, and a Claude-shaped
    `llm_model` is routed to `opus_model` where it belongs instead of being
    served to DeepSeek under its own id.

    idiom — see its docstring for why an out-param beats widening the return
    tuple: engine/ai_desk.py and several tests stub _call_model with a 2-tuple
    lambda, and every one of them would break if the return type grew). When a
    dict is passed, on SUCCESS this sets served["provider"] to the rung name
    make_call returned and served["model"] to that rung's model id (matched
    out of `providers` by name; left unset if the match is ambiguous). Left
    untouched on failure. Population is wrapped so a defect in it can never
    break a call that otherwise worked — same discipline as make_call's own
    _note().

    Determinism kit (W7 #33): temperature=0 + seed=0 for greedy/deterministic
    sampling. Content-hash cache: SHA-256(model‖system‖user) → cached reply text.
    Cache stores the FINAL post-lint text (updated by synthesize() after lint);
    on a cache HIT the stored text is already post-lint — synthesize() skips lint.

    W5 ITEM 1 — 401-fallback: master_brain defaults to DeepSeek as its primary
    provider (llm_base_url / api_key_env configurable). The waterfall is built via
    engine.llm_auth.build_providers() so a 401 from any provider falls back cleanly.
    The degraded_reason distinguishes "auth_invalid:<provider>" from "llm_error".

    RUNG ORDER (operator mandate): Codex (ChatGPT oauth) first, then Claude
    (oauth pool, then Anthropic API), then DeepSeek last — DeepSeek is the
    only metered pay-per-use rung; Codex and Claude are subscriptions already
    paid for. When this lane's legacy llm_* keys describe DeepSeek's endpoint
    (_is_deepseek_lane), the ladder is built via llm_auth.build_providers()
    after translating the legacy keys (_ladder_cfg) so a single DeepSeek
    balance exhaustion no longer blanks the whole brief. An operator who
    pinned some OTHER endpoint keeps the historic single-provider descriptor.
