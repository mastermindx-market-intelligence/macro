"""Subsector rotation & velocity — pure compute layer.

Turns Finviz's broad-universe **theme → subsector** performance snapshot
(``data/themes_heatmap/perf_snapshot.json``, 268 subsectors across 40 themes,
eight horizons) into a rotation read: which subsectors lead, which are turning,
and — the point — which are *accelerating* (an emerging-theme early-entry
signal). It is a separate lens from the 47 curated thematic baskets: those
are our own equal-weight indices; this rides Finviz's own broad numbers (which
include names we hold no prices for), so it stays a display/context layer.

Design
------
* **Pure.** Takes the already-loaded snapshot dicts and returns a JSON-ready
  payload. All disk/network I/O lives in ``scripts/build_subsector_rotation.py``.
* **Relative-strength, cross-sectional.** Every metric is computed *across*
  subsectors at each horizon (the benchmark is the median subsector), so a
  reading says "leading/lagging vs the rest of the market," not vs an index we
  may not have.
* **RRG-style quadrants.** ``rs_ratio`` (leadership level) × ``rs_mom`` (is that
  leadership improving) → Leading / Weakening / Lagging / Improving. The
  *Improving* quadrant (laggards turning up) plus positive ``accel`` is the
  early-rotation watchlist.
* **Turn read (additive).** ``engine/subsector_turn.py`` re-derives the same snapshot as a
  disjoint-segment pace curve plus a reconstructed level path, replays it over the
  append-only PIT archive, and attaches per-node cycle position, turn state
  (bottoming / turned up / topping / turned down) with cross-session confirmation, member
  breadth, and a parallel fast rank. Every incumbent field here is left byte-identical —
  the two reads are logged side by side and graded head-to-head by
  ``engine/subsector_track_record.py``.
