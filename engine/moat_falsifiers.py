"""engine/moat_falsifiers.py — Long-Hold Thesis Layer W2 PR-K: Moat Falsifier Sensors.

DISPLAY-ONLY — G1-DEFERRED ruling 2026-07-06.  horizon_role=hold_thesis.
These sensors MUST NOT feed board ordering, alert triage, top-setups gates,
or push floor.  No composite "moat score" is produced (LH-R2, Signal Commons R3).

Design contract (masterplan §4-W2 / rulings LH-R6, LH-R10)
-----------------------------------------------------------
This is a standalone fundamental-sensor module with its own dataclass design.
It is NOT structurally derived from ``engine/falsifier_tripwires.py`` (that module
handles event-schedule tripwires; this handles per-ticker financial-statement
sensors — different scope, no shared base class, no TripwireResult reuse).
The falsifier-sensor *concept* is consistent with masterplan §4-W2 wording.

Four falsifier sensors, each computed from ``data/edgar/statements.parquet``:

  1. margin_compression_despite_revenue_growth
     Gross margin declining YoY while revenue is still growing (at least 3% YoY).
     Classic moat-erosion signal: top-line intact, but pricing power or cost
     structure weakening.  Fire threshold: revenue_growth >= 3% AND
     gross_margin_pct latest < gross_margin_pct prior.  Both periods need
     POSITIVE revenue: a negative denominator sign-flips the margin and makes
     the comparison meaningless, so it is not-evaluable rather than a verdict.

  2. receivables_stretch
     Accounts receivable growing materially faster than revenue.
     Consistent AR outpacing revenue → channel-stuffing / collection risk.
     Fire threshold: receivables_growth > revenue_growth + 10pp (percentage-
     points) AND revenue is positive.

  3. inventory_build
     Inventory growing materially faster than revenue.
     Persistent build signals demand softness or over-production.
     Fire threshold: inventory_growth > revenue_growth + 15pp AND
     revenue is positive (i.e. not purely a revenue-drop artefact).

  4. capital_intensity_rising
     Capex growing faster than revenue AND faster than operating income,
     indicating the business requires ever more capital to produce the
     same or less unit output.
     Fire threshold: capex_growth > revenue_growth + 10pp AND
     capex_growth > op_income_growth + 10pp.  Op_income sign edge case handled:
     if CURRENT op_income is known and <= 0 the capex-vs-revenue condition alone
     must hold (the disclosed revenue-only fallback).  A MISSING/NaN op_income,
     or a prior op_income of ~0, is NOT that case — the declared evidence is
     absent, so the sensor returns None (not evaluable) instead of firing on the
     revenue leg alone.  Unknown is not non-positive.

For EACH sensor a universe-level base rate is computed:
  base_rate_annual — fraction of (ticker, fy) observations in the covered
  universe that satisfy the sensor condition in that fiscal year.
  This is the universe-level fire frequency; a sensor firing only when base_rate
  is near 1.0 is uninformative.  The base rate is printed in every result dict
  so callers can display it next to the firing flag.

  NOTE: the base rate is recomputed live over all tickers in statements.parquet
  on each build run — it is NOT a locked control value.  It shifts as the
  universe composition changes.  The pre-registered thresholds (research/long_hold/
  OBJECTIVE.md Amendment A3 §W2-PR-K) are the locked definition; the base rate
  is a live display-context annotation, not an inferential anchor.

Point-in-time gating
--------------------
``statements.parquet`` carries a ``period_end`` column (collectors/edgar_facts.py).
Before any sensor is evaluated, fiscal rows whose availability date
(``period_end + 120d`` — the conservative reporting-lag proxy used by the frames
PIT panel, collectors/edgar.py) is AFTER the ``asof_date`` are dropped, so a
not-yet-filed fiscal year can never fire a falsifier.  ``asof_date=None`` gates
against today (the live display path).  Rows lacking ``period_end`` (legacy rows,
synthetic frames) are kept — they cannot be gated, and this is a display-only
module.  The same gate is applied inside ``compute_base_rates`` so the universe
fire-frequency excludes not-yet-knowable fiscal years.

Coverage stamps
---------------
Every result dict carries:
  _horizon_role   : "hold_thesis"
  _display_only   : True
  _version        : "v1"
  coverage_n_years: number of fiscal year rows found for the ticker
  sensor_coverage : "full" | "partial" | "missing"
    - full    : 2+ rows with all required columns non-null
    - partial : 1 row, or required column(s) missing in some rows
    - missing : no rows for the ticker

Great-company-trap overlay (LH-R10)
-------------------------------------
A plain deterministic function assembled ONLY from existing signals:
  crowding_z     (from engine.theme_crowding / basket-level)
  insider_net    (from engine.equity_factors / altdata: negative = net selling)
  revision_dir   (from engine.analyst_revisions: "downgrading" = bearish)

May only LOWER conviction display context, never raise it.  Inputs are printed.
Returns a dict with:
  trap_signals_present: bool
  de_escalation_reason: list[str]  (human-readable, each leg printed)
  inputs_used: dict  (printed for transparency — Article-1/A3 shaped)
  _horizon_role, _display_only, _version

    """Great-company-trap de-escalation overlay (LH-R10).

    ONLY LOWERS conviction display context, never raises it.  Assembled
    from existing signals only (crowding context, insider net USD, analyst
    revision direction).  Deterministic — no LLM, no model, no scores.

    Inputs are printed in the output for full transparency (Article-1/A3 shape).
    Callers must pass values sourced from the existing signal surfaces; this
    function performs no I/O.

    Parameters
    ----------
    crowding_z:
        Basket/theme-level crowding z-score from ``engine.theme_crowding``.
        Values >= crowding_z_threshold indicate elevated crowding.
        Pass None if unavailable.
    insider_net_usd:
        Net insider trading USD for the name from
        ``engine.altdata.insider_netflow`` or ``engine.equity_factors``.
        Negative = net selling.  Pass None if unavailable.
    revision_direction:
        "upgrading" | "stable" | "downgrading" from
        ``engine.analyst_revisions.revision_for()``.
        Pass None if unavailable.
    crowding_z_threshold:
        Z-score at or above which crowding is considered elevated.
        Default: 1.0 — matches ``engine.theme_crowding.CROWDED_Z = 1.0``,
        the repo's crowding convention.
    insider_net_sell_threshold_usd:
        USD threshold below which insider net is considered meaningful selling.
        Default: -500,000.
