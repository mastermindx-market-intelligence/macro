"""Concept canon — ONE implementation per cross-engine concept (audit #7 #12 #28 #40 #45).

The audit found the same named quantity computed 2-3 divergent ways across engines,
with no source of truth: `net liquidity` computed 3 ways (one dropping TGA, one mixing
trillions with billions), `credit impulse` under one label meaning a 1st-derivative in
one engine and a 2nd-derivative in another, `VIX term` from three cached copies, and a
`sector_macro_beta` table with a physically-impossible XLC=1.0 that predates XLC's 2018
launch.  Divergences that can flip SIGN on the same day at the turning points that matter.

This module is the single canonical home.  Every consumer either imports the function
here or is validated byte-for-byte against its committed golden vector
(``tests/test_canon.py`` + ``tests/golden/canon_vectors.json``).  A concept computed two
ways is a bug the moment the two disagree; canon makes "they must agree" a testable
invariant instead of a coincidence.

DESIGN — two call conventions, one formula
------------------------------------------
Concepts are consumed from two data paths in this repo:
  * the ``store``/DataFrame path (``engine.inputs``) — already-scaled billions columns;
  * the raw-parquet ``idx``-reindex path (``engine.anticipation``) — reads FRED parquet
    and scales inline.
Canon exposes the *pure formula* (operating on already-aligned Series) AND a raw-parquet
loader that produces the correctly-scaled components, so both callers share one truth.

The confluence primitives (``rma``, ``ema``, ``rsi``, ``resample_sessions``) are the
CORRECTED math the cross-repo signal contract is anchored to (audit #7): SMA-seeded
Wilder RMA, recursive ``adjust=False`` EMA, and a session-GROUPED 3D/2D resample that
does not mis-split a bucket across a market gap the way calendar ``resample("3B")`` does.
The Terminal's ``signal_layer/confluence.py`` is ported to these and gated against the
exported golden vectors (``scripts/export_signal_contracts.py``).

ONE CONCEPT, TWO ANCHORS — READ THIS BEFORE "UNIFYING" THE 3D GRID.  The in-repo cascade
(``engine.confluence_tiers._tf_bars``) does NOT call :func:`resample_sessions`.  It is the
same session-GROUPED concept cut on an ABSOLUTE session calendar rather than on ordinals
counted from the caller's first bar — era ``abs-session-2026-08-06``, PR #4732, ruling
``research/SESSION_ANCHOR_ABSOLUTE_CALENDAR_ADJUDICATION_BY_FABLE.md``.  The split is
deliberate on both sides: the cascade needs a verdict that does not move with the caller's
slice, and canon must NOT be re-phased because its phase is part of the cross-repo contract
(``CONFLUENCE_PARAMS`` + the committed golden vectors the Terminal is gated against).
The two are the SAME FUNCTION on a contiguous window that opens on a bucket boundary and
diverge only by that phase — pinned bar-for-bar by ``tests/test_canon.py`` §5b, which also
records why a delegate in either direction is a regression.  Neither is the calendar bin.
