"""China Special Situations desk engine.

Fuses six data planes into a schema-versioned, context-only JSON:
  NEW  : unlocks, preannouncements, inquiry letters, ST board + history, goodwill
  EXISTING: buybacks, pledge stress, block-trade anomalies, earnings calendar

Output: site/chinaspecialdata/special.json  (schema: china_special_sits.v1)

Rules:
- Every input degrades independently (try/except → None, log warning)
- Per-input asof + status chips surface staleness
- NO composite scores, NO buy/sell language
- Counts, ranks by DISCLOSED magnitudes, dates, links only
- Direction labels = exchange-reported 预告类型 verbatim
- Inquiry letters = metadata + link only (no body text)
- ST watch labeled "history accrues from 2026-07 forward" until ≥2 dates present

Unlock ratio note: 占解禁前流通市值比例 is a FRACTION (1.0 = 100%). Engine stores
float_pct = ratio * 100 so that float_pct=5.0 means 5% of pre-unlock float.

Data freshness / ordering dependency:
    data/china_filings/filings.parquet is written by the asia-lane collect step
    (collectors/china_filings.py) that runs BEFORE this engine is invoked by
    build_china_special_situations.py. There is NO in-build refresh of china_filings
    — the collector is network-bound and belongs in the collect phase only.
    Running this engine standalone reads whatever filings.parquet was last committed
    by the collector; the asof/status chip surfaces staleness honestly.

    """Return (canonical_key, utc_variant_key, cst_plus1_key) for an inquiry claim.

    Canonical key: the claim key derived from date_str as given (for the filings plane
    this is already the CST date; for a legacy-path snap the stored date is a UTC date).

    utc_variant_key: canonical_key with date − 1 day.
        Rationale: the filings plane stores publish_ts in Asia/Shanghai; publish_ts[:10]
        is the CST date (D). The legacy collector stored UTC-basis dates; for events at
        00:00–08:00 CST (prior UTC day), the legacy date was D−1. Checking utc_variant_key
        ensures that a claim registered from the filings path (canonical=D) blocks
        re-registration from the legacy path (which arrives with date D−1 → its
        canonical_key would be inq_{code}_{D-1}).

    cst_plus1_key: canonical_key with date + 1 day.
        Rationale (reverse direction): when the legacy source arrives first with date=D−1
        (UTC date), and the filings source has already written canonical=D to the sidecar,
        the legacy processing sees date=D−1 → canonical=D−1, utc_variant=D−2.  Neither
        matches D in the sidecar. The fix: also check D−1+1 = D (the CST "next day"
        candidate for a UTC-dated row). Legacy UTC date can lag CST by one day, never
        lead; so checking date+1 as an additional sidecar lookup covers that direction.
        Document: "legacy UTC date can lag CST by one day, never lead."

    Dedup contract: register_claims checks ALL THREE keys only for transition-era rows
    (canonical date <= _LEGACY_UTC_KEY_CUTOFF). Post-cutoff rows use canonical key only.
    Registration always writes the canonical key (the date_str as provided by the snap —
    already CST for filings).

    """Register salience-only qledger claims for inquiry-letter and large-unlock events.

    Called from the SCHEDULED CI LANE (build_china_special_situations, inside build_china.py
    which runs in asia-close). Gated on CN_LANE=asia to prevent intraday / render-lane
    ledger writes (mirrors the china_standout_track lane guard pattern).

    direction=0 for all claims (salience-only); claim_family=cn_special_sits.

    Deduplication: each event registers exactly ONCE per event identity via an append-only
    sidecar data/china_special_sits/claims_registered.parquet
    (columns: event_key, first_registered).
    event_key: unlock → unlock_{ticker}_{unlock_date}; inquiry → inq_{secCode}_{announce_date}

    Claim-key timezone canonicalization (CST skew fix):
        The canonical claim key uses the Asia/Shanghai (CST) calendar date of the event.
        The legacy collector (collectors/china_inquiry.py) stored UTC-basis dates; for
        events published 00:00–08:00 CST, the legacy UTC date is one day behind the CST
        date. To prevent double-registration across the source switch, when checking the
        sidecar this function tests BOTH the canonical CST-basis key AND the legacy
        UTC-basis key (CST date − 1 day). Registration always writes the canonical key.
        See _cst_claim_keys() for the derivation.

    Entity scope: scope_type='entity', scope_key=<normalized ticker> (mirrors communique_diff.py
    lines ~431-444). Falls back to macro/510300.SS only when ticker normalization fails.

    Returns count registered; 0 on any failure.
