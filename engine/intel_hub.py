"""INTELLIGENCE HUB — the US central command that fuses every signal desk into one read.

The dashboard already fuses four per-ticker facets in engine.intelligence (news flow ·
alt-data signal · divergence radar · factor buy-board). This module adds the FIFTH desk —
Policy Watch — and lifts the whole thing from "facts side by side" to a reasoned, ranked
CENTRAL COMMAND with second- and third-order analysis:

  • per-ticker DOSSIER — the five facets + a cross-source CONFIRMATION count, a single
    composite CONVICTION (0-100) that rewards independent agreement and is DOCKED by an
    unanswered falsifier, the policy tailwind/headwind, news VELOCITY (day-over-day), and
    the 2nd/3rd-order FLAGS that name the setup (stealth_accumulation / early_edge /
    crowded_top / confirmed_trend / fading / policy_aligned / policy_conflict).
  • SECTOR heat — per-GICS roll-up: mean/max conviction, the widest demand-vs-supply
    divergence, the policy tilt, and the early-edge / crowded-top counts.
  • DIVERGENCE alerts — the demand-tape-vs-smart-money disagreements, the highest-
    information names, ranked.
  • COMMAND summary — the macro frame, the priority dossiers, and the cross-desk status
    the future US Mastermind pulls.

CONTEXT-ONLY · DEGRADE-NEVER-RAISE · PURE where it can be. Nothing here scores or sizes a
position; it reasons over already-built artifacts and republishes one coherent command view.

# US UNIVERSE SCOPE — membership decided ONCE, at ingestion.
#
# The hub inherits whatever the intelligence bundle carries, and the altdata feeder
# (special_situations especially) delivers FOREIGN listings symbol-shaped: ANANTRAJ
# (NSE), BULTEN (Stockholm), CEMARGOS (feed ticker CEMARGOS.BO, suffix stripped at
# keying), German/Korean/SIX/LSE codes, unpriced OTC ordinaries (AKZOF) and warrants
# (ACHR.WS). Nothing downstream can ever grade those: the forward track record is
# SPY-relative off the US price layer, so such a name accrues a ledger row every
# night that can never mature. Measured 2026-08-08, pre-gate: 1,045 of 3,083 names
# (34%) were neither US-listed nor US-priceable, and they were 78,105 of 170,676
# ledger rows (46%) — permanently ungradeable volume.
#
# MEMBERSHIP = the US-exchange roster (latest data/symbol_directory snapshot, test
# issues dropped) UNION the hub's OWN US price spine (a per-ticker data/yahoo parquet
# or a data/breadth close-cache column). Everything else is excluded WITH A COUNT —
# annotated in hub.json and one log line, never silently. Normalization is the ./-
# swap ONLY (BRK.B ↔ BRK-B); an exchange prefix/suffix is NEVER stripped or mapped,
# because aliasing a foreign issuer onto a US key is the exact corruption this
# prevents. The China parquet fallback inside ai_desk._close_series confers NO
# membership — this spine is US-only. FAIL-OPEN: an unreadable roster, an empty glob, a
# roster below the sanity floor, or a verdict that would exclude the WHOLE universe (a
# broken roster/universe pairing, not a scoping result) stamps applied:false with a reason
# and leaves the universe untouched — a broken store degrades to the pre-gate behaviour
# rather than emptying the hub.
