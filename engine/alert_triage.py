"""Alert Command Center — the honest triage layer over every alert engine.

The dashboard already emits alerts from six engines (macro ``engine.alerts``,
``bonds_alerts``, ``forex_alerts``, ``btc_alerts``, ``commodity_alerts`` and the
per-stock ``ticker_alerts``).  Each screams on its own page with its own local
severity scale, so a forex per-pair momentum "high" looks as loud as a credit
blow-out.  This module is a *pure assembler* that pulls the recent cross-asset /
macro feeds into ONE ranked board and answers, per alert, the only questions a
PM actually asks:

  • how loud is it, really?  → a TRUE cross-asset conviction tier (act / watch /
    context), not each engine's local severity word;
  • how much should it grab my attention right now?  → a TRANSPARENT triage
    *priority* (0-100) blended from conviction + severity + recency + whether the
    cross-asset backdrop corroborates it.  This is a prioritiser, NOT a
    probability the call is right — the components are shown;
  • what is the measured edge?  → the ``edge`` note the engine already derived
    from its calibration, PLUS — only where a validated Signal-Lab row backs the
    alert family — the real hit-rate / Deflated-Sharpe / verdict, linked to
    signal_lab.html.  Where there is NO backtest we say so ("documented, not
    backtested") rather than invent a number;
  • what's the regime + event backdrop?  → the current quad / cycle and the next
    high-impact catalyst, shown as shared context.

Honesty rules baked in (this repo's culture):
  - we NEVER fabricate a per-alert hit-rate.  A number appears only when
    ``engine.signal_lab`` already validated that signal family.
  - "priority" is explicitly a triage prioritiser, never dressed up as P(correct).
  - regime "fit" is shown as context; we do not claim a measured
    regime-conditional edge the validation layer doesn't have.

Additive + graceful: every reader is wrapped so a missing feed degrades to an
empty section, never a failed build.

WHO RENDERS THIS PAGE (verified 2026-08-20 — there is no ``build_alerts.py``)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
``build_triage()`` has exactly one page owner, and it is the shared site plane:

    scripts/build_site.py :: build_alerts_page(env, site, generated)
        payload = alert_triage.build_triage()
        payload["generated_utc"] = generated          # aligned with the rest of the site
        -> templates/alerts.html.j2  -> site/alerts.html
        -> site/factordata/alerts_triage.json         (the whole payload, machine-readable)
        -> site/alertsdata/feed.json                  (admin Alerts capture tab, RUL-8)

Nothing else renders it.  The only OTHER consumer of this module is the push spine below
(``push_priority_alerts`` / ``push_ops_alert``), which re-runs ``build_triage()`` itself.
Extend that plane — do not add a parallel builder.

TIME (see engine/alert_time.py for the full contract)
-----------------------------------------------------
Three clocks are kept separate and are NOT interchangeable: ``event_date`` / ``event_ts``
(when the thing happened), ``source_asof`` (the observation it was derived from), and
``recorded_at`` / ``generated_utc`` (when we processed it).  The board's "today" is the
**America/New_York** day, because this is a US cross-asset desk — at 00:30Z New York is
still on the previous afternoon, and a board that rolled over with UTC spent the whole
nightly window mislabelling the prior session as "today".

# MODELING v2 — persistence, lifecycle, storyline clustering, board read
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The v1 board deduplicated re-fires down to a single best instance, which threw
# away the fact that a flag firing every day for a week is stickier than a one-off.
# It also showed 60 disconnected rows with no board-level synthesis, so the two
# loudest-by-VOLUME feeds (single-name alt-data + theme rotation) buried the two
# most-important-by-CONSEQUENCE ones (credit / recession / the BTC risk regime).
#
# These helpers recover that information WITHOUT breaking the honesty culture:
#   • persistence + lifecycle are DESCRIPTIVE (a fire-count is a fact, not a
#     forecast).  They feed the DEMOTE-ONLY severity cap below as one corroborator,
#     so a persisting flag can RETAIN the engine's own prior band (decline a
#     demotion) — it can preserve, but never manufacture, priority above that prior.
#     No surface is ever raised above its hardcoded prior — Article-2 safe;
#   • the corroboration cap only ever DEMOTES a severity band (extends the #42
#     "cap a null emitter, never raise it" doctrine to the whole board), so no
#     surface gains conviction it didn't earn;
#   • storyline clustering + the board read are pure display groupings over the
#     already-ranked feed; they do not reorder it.

# (source, type) → storyline cluster id.  DISPLAY grouping only.

# An event log can prove how many times something fired, when it first fired, when it

# ``streak_days = (last - first).days``, called that a streak, and then called anything

# month-long state.
#

# event, span_days, and the word "re-fired" — and the lifecycle vocabulary for a generic
# log is new / recurring / aging.  "persisting" (and its partner "fading") is reserved
# for a source that explicitly establishes current-state continuity by setting

# PUSH SPINE — Neural Web W6a/W6b
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Article-2 surface: priority inputs are unvalidated hand-weights. These
# functions are CONFIG-GATED (alert_push.enabled=false by default in W6a;
# enabled=true in W6b — operator decision, see config.yml comment block).
# Enabling is an operator event — it converts a display-only priority score
# into automated outbound dispatch. Per Article 2: no ranking/priority surface
# may RAISE a score without SHADOW-with-track-record tier. These functions
# never raise scores; they only dispatch alerts that already cleared the floor.
#
# W6b DESIGN: per-lane dedup stores (push_sent_<lane>.jsonl) preserve single-
# writer law per file. The dedup window check reads ALL stores (read-many,
# write-one). This means basket_freeze, signal_sanity, and healthcheck each
# own their own ledger file and are the SOLE writer to that file — no race,
# no lock needed. push_priority_alerts() continues to use push_sent.jsonl
# (the original lane). The dedup check for ops alerts reads all push_sent*
# files so cross-lane duplicates are also suppressed.
#
# WHITEHOUSE: the whitehouse pattern (single-writer hourly sentinel) is SACRED
# and is NOT migrated here. It remains untouched. push_ops_alert() never
# reads data/whitehouse/alerts.jsonl.
#
# SIGNAL SENTINELS (vector/commodity): PHASE 3 — not migrated in this PR.
# They have existing dedup; the migration would add priority context only.
# Noted as follow-up in the W6b masterplan entry.

# OPS-TIER PUSH ADAPTER — Neural Web W6b
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# push_ops_alert() is the single entry point for ops-tier senders
# (basket_freeze, signal_sanity, healthcheck) that previously called
# send_telegram/send_discord directly with no dedup and no priority floor.
#
# DESIGN INVARIANTS:
# 1. DISPATCH-ALWAYS FOR OPS LANES: ops/liveness alerts (heartbeat, tripwire,
#    churn-guard) MUST reach the operator regardless of the enabled flag.
#    When alert_push.enabled=false the dedup spine and per-lane ledger are
#    skipped, but send_telegram/send_discord are still called raw so that
#    disabling the noise-reduction spine cannot silence a critical liveness
#    alert.  The flag controls dedup+ledger overhead only, not the send.
# 2. PER-LANE SINGLE-WRITER: the caller names its lane; the dedup record is
#    appended ONLY to data/alert_triage/push_sent_<lane>.jsonl. Single-writer
#    law per file is preserved. No lock needed.
# 3. DEDUP WINDOW (enabled only): before dispatch, reads ALL push_sent*.jsonl
#    files (the original push_sent.jsonl + all per-lane files) so cross-lane
#    duplicates are also suppressed within the window_hours window.  Skipped
#    entirely when enabled=false (raw dispatch has no dedup).
# 4. MESSAGE PRESERVED: the caller supplies the message text verbatim; no
#    content rewriting. The ops message is wrapped in a minimal envelope only
#    for the dedup key (source + type_ + "").
# 5. NEVER RAISES: always returns bool; exceptions are logged, never re-raised.
# 6. WHITEHOUSE UNTOUCHED: this function never reads whitehouse/ or calls any
#    whitehouse-specific path.

    """Dispatch a single ops-tier alert, bypassing the spine only for dedup/ledger.

    This is the W6b adapter for senders that previously called send_telegram/
    send_discord directly.  Unlike push_priority_alerts(), ops/liveness alerts
    are dispatch-always: ``alert_push.enabled=false`` disables the dedup spine
    and per-lane ledger but still calls send_telegram/send_discord raw so that
    a heartbeat or tripwire failure is never silenced by a flag flip.  When the
    spine is enabled, per-lane dedup and the JSONL ledger are applied normally.

    Parameters
    ----------
    source:
        Alert source identifier (e.g. "basket_freeze", "signal_sanity",
        "healthcheck"). Used as the dedup key component.
    type_:
        Alert type within the source (e.g. "churn_guard", "tripwire_failed",
        "heartbeat_failed"). Used as the dedup key component.
    message:
        The human-readable message text to dispatch verbatim.
    severity:
        "critical", "major", or "minor". Used only for logging; does not gate
        dispatch (the config threshold applies).
    lane:
        The per-lane ledger name (one of: "basket_freeze", "signal_sanity",
        "healthcheck"). Determines which push_sent_<lane>.jsonl is written.
        Defaults to source if empty.
    window_hours:
        Dedup window override (hours). If None, reads from config
        alert_push.window_hours (default 6).
    root:
        Repo root override (used in tests).
    _now:
        datetime override (used in tests).
    _dedup_store:
        Explicit dedup store path override (used in tests; overrides lane
        resolution).

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True if dispatched on at least one channel, False otherwise.

    Never raises — always returns bool.
