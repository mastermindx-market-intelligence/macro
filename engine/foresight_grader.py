"""Foresight forward-grading — the learning loop of the Thematic Foresight Desk
(research/THEMATIC_FORESIGHT_DESK.md Phase 5 + INSTITUTIONAL_UPGRADE.md "PIT-grading rigor").
Makes the desk's own hit-rate measured, public, and HONEST — it must not over-report.

The cascade logs every stage flag at fire time (data/foresight/log.jsonl for ALL stages including
RE-RATING/WATCH — negative calls are testable claims too; data/glut_watch/log.jsonl for GLUT
exit calls). This grader re-opens each MATURED flag at each horizon, computes the theme's realized
equal-weight excess return vs SPY over the horizon, and records hit/miss. A thesis hits on
OUTperformance; a glut call hits on UNDERperformance.

MULTI-HORIZON GRADING (W0a): each ledger row is graded at 30, 60, and 90 days independently.
A row is graded at a horizon once that horizon has matured — shorter horizons yield early reads
while 90d accrues. Per-stage × per-horizon hit-rates + avg excess + Wilson CIs are reported.
The per-theme sign test and Benjamini-Yekutieli FDR gate run on the CANONICAL 90d horizon only
(to avoid multiplying the FDR surface across horizons). `n_pending` counts rows logged but not
yet mature at 90d; per-horizon counts are exposed separately.

THREE RIGOR GUARDS so the published track record cannot lie (the upgrade ask):
  1. SURVIVORSHIP-FREE — a member that DELISTED mid-horizon is NOT dropped (dropping losers
     inflates returns). Its terminal return uses its last traded close (or an imputed -100%
     bankruptcy close from data/edgar/dead_name_prices.parquet when available).
  2. POINT-IN-TIME MEMBERSHIP — grade the basket as it was AT FLAG TIME (the `members` snapshot
     logged in the ledger), not today's config (which may have added winners after the fact).
  3. MULTIPLE-TESTING CORRECTION — across many themes, a high hit-rate can be a multiple-
     comparisons artifact. Report a per-theme sign-test p-value with a Benjamini-Yekutieli FDR
     gate (dependence-robust — BY is more conservative than BH, valid under arbitrary dependence
     from overlapping horizons and a shared SPY benchmark), and a Wilson 95% CI on the pooled
     hit-rate — so a small lucky sample can't read as edge.

HONEST BY CONSTRUCTION: ledgers began accruing from W0a → flags logged but n_graded=0 /
n_pending=N until 30d horizon matures (first reads in ~30 days); no fabricated hit-rate.
Forward-only, no look-ahead. Pure given the stores.
