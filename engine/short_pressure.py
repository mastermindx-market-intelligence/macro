"""Short-pressure axes — DISPLAY-ONLY CONTEXT, printed legs, never a fused score.

WHAT THIS IS. Six short-side positioning axes read off the PIT short-interest
panel (scripts/backfill_finra_short_interest.py), the IBKR borrow panel
(collectors/ibkr_borrow.py) and the FINRA daily short-volume panel. Each axis is
returned SEPARATELY with its own coverage. Nothing here adds, weights, or ranks
them.

WHY NO COMPOSITE — this is a legal constraint, not a style preference:
  * "Positioning fusion (positioning keys fused into signal scores) | ILLEGAL"
    (DO_NOT_REBUILD, Signal Commons rulings 2026-07-05).
  * SM2-R3: "No composite across 13F/insider/short/options axes at any grain...
    No function may accept both a 13F metric and a short-derived metric
    (days_to_cover, si_change_pct) as combined inputs producing a single number."
  * "Short-side lobe as directional shorting | FORBIDDEN — AVOID-not-SHORT
    evidence only" (DO_NOT_REBUILD; NW rails+lobes 2026-07-06).
So the popular "high short interest + rising estimates + call skew = squeeze
candidate" recipe cannot be built here as one number. The compliant form is the
one below: print each axis, count how many agree, and say plainly that the
agreement is ungraded. A display-tier composite would additionally require the
PSI §3.1.2 construction law (printed legs, v0 equal weights, abstention, day-one
forward grading) — see research/short_side/SP1_SHORT_PRESSURE_PREREG.md, which
freezes that test. Until it reads out, this module states state, not stance.

DIRECTION, STATED HONESTLY. The cross-sectional literature runs one way: high
days-to-cover predicts LOW forward returns (Hong-Li-Ni-Scheinkman-Yan), and
expensive-to-borrow names underperform. The "squeeze" reading is the retail
inversion of a bearish base rate. This module therefore never renders high short
pressure as bullish. It also does not render it as a short recommendation — the
same literature (Muravyev-Pearson-Pollet 2025) finds the long/short version of
that edge is consumed by the borrow fee itself, which is precisely why an
avoid/de-risk lens is the honest use and a short book is not.

THREE MEASURED TRAPS, all guarded here:
  1. days_to_cover is capped at 999.99 when ADV rounds to 0 — 17.8% of all rows,
     so the raw column's p90 IS the sentinel. Percentiles here are computed on
     uncapped rows only.
  2. The feed is ~42% OTC, which carries nearly all the sentinels. Percentiles
     here are computed on exchange-listed rows only.
  3. Borrow fee is near-CONSTANT in our universe: median 0.35%, 18 of 1,519
     names at/above 1%, none above 20% (2026-08-05), against a full-file median
     of 1.10%. Z-scoring fee across our universe alone scores noise around a flat
     line, so fee is exposed as a rare-event FLAG with an absolute threshold,
     never as a percentile or z. Same structural-constancy trap already filed
     against single-name gamma_regime (audit #29).

PIT LAW. `asof_slice` joins on `knowable_date` — the 8th NYSE session after
settlement, one definition in `lib/finra_knowable.py` — never on `settlement_date`.
Joining on settlement date buys ~8 sessions of look-ahead because FINRA
disseminates well after the position date. This module READS the panel's stored
`knowable_date` and never derives it, so the convention only takes effect when
`data/finra/short_interest_panel.parquet` is rebuilt. The retired
`settlement + 10 calendar days` was measured EARLY on every settlement the repo
holds (see `lib/finra_knowable.py`); studies keyed to this column shift 1-3
sessions later on that rebuild. Nothing rebuilds the panel on a schedule — the
backfill is a manual script in no workflow — and this module is currently imported
only by its own tests and the SP1 study. **If you are the first to wire `asof_slice`
into a surface, rebuild the panel FIRST**, or you ship the retired rule's look-ahead
on day one. Governance record: `research/short_side/SP1_SHORT_PRESSURE_PREREG.md`
