"""Foresight Desk data-health surface — P0-D of the upgrade programme.

`compute_foresight_health` derives per-leg status from the already-computed payloads
(pure function — does NOT re-run any engine).  The result is emitted into the cascade
JSON and rendered as a compact status strip on foresight.html so users can tell a live
machine from a dead one.

Status enum per leg:
  LIVE    — the leg has genuine, non-degenerate data today
  PARTIAL — the leg has partial data (n/m counts surfaced in the `detail` key)
  DARK    — the leg is absent / all-AWAITING / all-None — no real read

Top-level:
  n_leading_live  — count of LEADING legs (t1_fred, t1_text, t2_demand, t3_guidance,
                    power) with status LIVE or PARTIAL
  mode            — "FULL" if any of t1_fred / t1_text is LIVE or PARTIAL;
                    "CONFIRMER-ONLY" otherwise

Append-only log: one JSON line per build to data/foresight/health_log.jsonl (deduped
by date; created if absent).

Degrade gracefully — any missing / None input → that leg DARK, never raises.
