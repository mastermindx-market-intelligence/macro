"""Prophet × Stage-Analysis fusion backtest harness (PSF).

Binding pre-registration: ``research/PROPHET_STAGE_FUSION_PREREG.md`` (committed
2026-07-20 BEFORE any graded result). This module implements arms A / B / B-fresh /
C, the one-grader ruler, the §4 metrics (Wilson 95% CI, n_dates independence,
regime split, block-bootstrap by month), the §5 falsifiers, and the §7 look-ahead
controls EXACTLY as written. It reinvents nothing:

  * base timing signal  ->  ``engine.confluence_tiers.tier_stream`` (the validated
      T1-T4 close-only cascade). A "fresh fire" = a per-day transition INTO T1 or T2.
  * stage_at_entry      ->  ``engine.weinstein_stage.stage_series`` / ``classify``
      (PIT weekly stage + weeks_in_stage, close[:entry] truncation).
  * grading             ->  ``engine.grading.terminal_state`` (clean15_126 & clean8_21),
      ``forward_metrics`` (21/63/126), ``grading.resolve_series`` dead-name imputation
      (a delisted name carries its graded loss instead of vanishing).
  * EC join             ->  ``data/stage_analysis/backfill/earnings_calls.parquet`` on
      ``document_ticker`` with ``call_date < entry_date``, most-recent row.

§ SURVIVORSHIP (FIX-2 — honest universe, not the false ``as_of_panel`` claim). The universe
is the union of the live price globs (``baskets/ohlcv`` ∪ ``data/stocks``) WITH the delisted
tickers from the dead-name store (``data/edgar/dead_name_prices.parquet``) that are ABSENT
from the live globs — those (mostly losing) delisted fires are graded via
``grading.resolve_series`` (which returns the dead series when there is no live cache) and
ARE counted. This is NOT a full point-in-time (PIT) reconstruction: S&P-1500 PIT members
(``data/breadth/sp1500_pit_membership.parquet``) that traded 2022–26 but have NO price source
in either the live globs OR the dead-name store are still absent and CANNOT be graded (no
series exists); their count is disclosed in the ``universe`` block. The universe therefore
remains survivor-LEAN for those price-source-less names — absolute win-rates are upward-biased
(surviving names win more), but the falsifier verdicts are DELTA-based (A→B→C win-rate
differences), and survivorship inflates all arms' absolute win-rates ~symmetrically, so the
null on the delta is robust to the residual lean. This is disclosed in §0 of the report.

§0 PROXY DISCLOSURE (printed on every surfaced result): Prophet has no backtestable
history (5 live entries post-2026-07-10). PSF tests the FUSION MECHANISM on the repo's
validated T1-T4 confluence cascade as a PIT-replayable Prophet-family timing entry. A
positive result is strong evidence the mechanism helps Prophet's own entries — confirmed
forward on live Prophet from go-live. It is NOT a Prophet replay. Results are display-tier
until an operator-ratified promotion.

Efficiency (per §EFFICIENCY): for each ticker we precompute ONCE the daily tier_stream
and the weekly stage_series, then detect fresh-fire events and look up stage/weeks/EC at
each fire's date — never re-classifying per fire.
