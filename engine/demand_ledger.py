"""Demand-chain scored ledger — Phase 2 of the Demand Desk (see memory
demand-desk-divergence). Turns the LEADING customer-demand chains' divergence
reads into FALSIFIABLE, forward-scored predictions so we can eventually answer:
does "customer capex ahead of consensus" actually precede relative strength?

This reuses the exact accountability chassis behind engine/ai_desk.py +
engine/policy_intent_desk.py — append-only theses.jsonl with a machine-checkable
rel_return predicate, scored deterministically by engine/ai_desk_scorer.py into
scored.jsonl + track_record.json. Unlike ai_desk the thesis is RULE-DERIVED (the
divergence is deterministic), so there is no LLM call here.

What earns a thesis:
- ONLY leading chains (ai_datacenter; housing is coincident → display-only).
- ONLY divergence ∈ {ahead_of_consensus, consensus_at_risk} — i.e. the chain and
  the priced consensus actually DISAGREE. "aligned" / "signal_only" make no
  falsifiable claim, so they stay display-only (the panel's "stay silent when you
  merely agree with consensus" rule, enforced in the ledger).

Predicate (mirrors ai_desk's overweight/avoid):
- ahead_of_consensus → bet it OUTPERFORMS SPY: miss if rel_return < -5% over the
  chain's horizon, else hit.
- consensus_at_risk → bet it LAGS SPY: miss if rel_return > +5%, else hit.

Honesty: conviction is always "low" — this is an unproven signal being scored
forward to EARN credibility, never a buy signal and never fed into any score.

    durably exist in this desk's own ledger. Never raises.

    THE CONTROL LEG (P0d C2.3). `demand_chain` is classified
    `matched_control_required`, so its authority basis IS the matched control and
    a claim registered without one can never carry evidence. `sector_of` is
    `qledger.membership_gics_sector_of(root)`: subject ticker ->

    the explicit alias normalisation the census's D0-2 requires (the file mixes
    GICS "Information Technology" with Yahoo-style "Technology" on different
    names, so a naive join nulls on roughly half the universe and nothing
    alarms). `make_claim` turns that name into the sector ETF. Passing NO
    resolver — the state before this wiring — registered every demand_chain claim
    uncontrolled forever and its control-evidence clock could never start.

    `raw_sector_of` is TELEMETRY, not construction: the normalising resolver
    above answers None both for a ticker the universe file does not hold and for
    a vocabulary the alias table cannot map, so without the raw read every D0-2
    mismatch would be counted as `sector_absent` and the nightly `::warning`
