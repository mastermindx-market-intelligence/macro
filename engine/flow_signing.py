"""engine/flow_signing.py — trade-side signing methods + their calibration (pure, testable).

Our flow engine signs volume with the TICK RULE because the per-trade tape + NBBO are not in
our massive.com entitlement. The honest question is: HOW WRONG is the tick rule vs the
gold-standard QUOTE RULE (which needs the NBBO)? This module holds the two signing rules and
the calibration that answers it — pure functions so they unit-test without any vendor.

Once a Databento `tbbo` sample (each trade stamped with the prevailing NBBO) is pulled
(collectors/databento_tbbo), scripts/calibrate_flow_signing feeds it here to measure:
  • per-trade agreement between tick-rule and quote-rule signs, and
  • whether our MINUTE-aggregated tick-rule recovers the same NET daily sign per contract
    (what actually feeds the dealer-positioning read).
The result writes a gate so the flow engine can state its signing accuracy honestly instead
of guessing. References: Lee-Ready (1991), Ellis-Michaely-O'Hara (2000).

    BID-ASK BOUNCE (the minute close is a random draw from bid/ask), which delta-adjustment
    cannot fix. Its gain only appears on high-underlying-move days. Kept as a building block;
