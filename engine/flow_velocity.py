"""Capital-flow VELOCITY — how fast (and accelerating) big money is moving into China /
Hong Kong names and sectors, off data the build already collects.

The user's ask: *"track how big money is flowing into certain equities and sectors —
daily / weekly / monthly — and track velocity."* This engine turns the existing net-flow
series into a kinetics read:

  • LEVEL      — net flow over a window (¥ for the aggregate channels; a normalized
                 main-money net-RATE for the per-name A-share grid).
  • VELOCITY   — the standardized recent net-flow rate (t-stat of the trailing drift of
                 cumulative flow vs its own vol). + = money flowing IN faster than normal.
  • ACCELERATION — the 2nd derivative: is that velocity itself rising or fading.

Four panels, each from a source ALREADY on disk (keyless at build time — no Tushare call):

  aggregate      data/china_connect/{southbound,northbound}  — the whole-channel "all
                 mainland / all foreign money" tape. Southbound is live & deep (2014→);
                 NORTHBOUND aggregate net was discontinued 2024-08-16 under the Stock
                 Connect "home-market" rule, so it is surfaced as HISTORICAL-ONLY.
  ashare_names   data/tushare/flow_hist.parquet  — DAILY per-name 主力 (super-large +
                 large order) net-RATE grid; velocity/acceleration per name, ranked.
  ashare_sectors the same grid rolled into the 22 curated baskets_china sectors
                 (equal-weight member mean) — "which sector is big money rushing into".
  ashare_seats   data/china_lhb/detail.parquet  — Dragon-Tiger 机构专用 institutional-seat
                 net buys: the closest free *institution-level* read for A-shares (seats
                 are anonymous; a recent-window snapshot, not a velocity).
  hk_names       data/hk_southbound/holdings.parquet — mainland's per-name southbound
                 holdings; the daily history is still SHALLOW, so multi-horizon velocity
                 unlocks as it accrues — until then the 5/10-day accumulation board shows.

HONESTY GATE (house rule, [[signal-contract-gate]]): this is a DISPLAY / CONTEXT desk.
Flow is NEVER scored into an allocation signal (the codebase tested per-name fund-flow:
rank-IC ≈ −0.008, no edge — research/CHINA_HK_STOCK_SIGNALS.md). Velocity here is a
*positioning lens*, not alpha. All transforms are causal & point-in-time; every loader is
None-safe so a missing/stale parquet drops its panel and the page still builds.

# ── horizon configs (windows are in the SOURCE's native bars) ─────────────────
# BOTH sources are DAILY. The per-name / sector grid was WRITTEN as a weekly cross-section grid,
# but collectors/tushare_history._grid_dates() was tail-anchored (`idx[-260:][::5]`): the stride
# phase shifted one trading day per build, the append-only store accreted every phase, and the
# panel became ~1 bar per trading day (verified: median gap 1 day, ~20 distinct dates/month).
# That collector now emits a CONTIGUOUS daily grid anchored on the newest close, so daily is the
# declared shape rather than an accident — and the newest bar is no longer 4 trading days stale.
# Windows below are sized in TRADING DAYS so the "4wk"/"13wk" labels the UI prints are true
# (20 / 65 bars), not 5x short.
#
# `demean` is load-bearing, not cosmetic. slope_z measures drift against ZERO, but neither
# source has a zero null: 主力净占比 has a structural mean of ~-2.5% (the order-size tiers sum
# to zero per stock and the 主力 tier is the persistently negative one — 97% of names have a
# negative mean), and southbound net is structurally POSITIVE (77% of days). Undemeaned, the
# measure's null sits at ~-0.6 for names / ~-1.1 for sectors / ~+3.3 for southbound, while the
# +-0.5 cutoffs assume a null of 0 — so the readout pins to one verdict forever (backtested:
# the sector breadth gauge printed "broad outflow" on 93.4% of days and "broad inflow" on 0 of
# 256; southbound printed "accelerating in" on 96.6% of the last 2y and "out" on none of them).
# Subtracting a CAUSAL trailing mean restores a zero null and makes the gauges move again.
#
# `vol_floor` guards the denominator: a name whose flow goes quiet gets a collapsing baseline
# vol and a manufactured extreme (a name with a +0.5% net rate and a 0.11 baseline printed
# +9.64σ and topped the leaderboard, outranking a name with 13.3% actual net flow). Floor the
# baseline at a fraction of the series' own causal expanding vol.
