"""engine.us_early_turn — the EARLY-TURN starter tier (ANTICIPATION §6.9 R3).

WHAT THIS IS
------------
US Prophet entry lateness decomposes (masterplan §6.9) into five causes, two of which
this module answers:

  (2) nothing admits on the EARLIEST mechanical evidence — the "dot signature";
  (5) entry = the asof close, with no structure zone.

The systematic answer is NOT predicting before evidence exists.  It is entering on the
earliest evidence tier at STARTER size with a structure-anchored zone, and letting the
slower confirmation ADD.  This module supplies the mechanical reads that decision needs:

  * :func:`turn_signature`  — the dot signature: a StochRSI %K cross up FROM WASHED plus
    a curling RSI-MACD histogram, on the daily and 2D grids.
  * :func:`extension_state` — the anti-chase read: %K on the daily AND the 3D grid, so
    a name that is stretched on both can be refused a market entry (NVDA acceptance).
  * :func:`reset_band`     — the pullback/reset band a wait plan waits AT.
  * :func:`basket_turn_context` / :func:`leader_pullback_context` — the two CONTEXTS
    that license a starter admission.  The signature alone never does.

INDICATOR PROVENANCE (binding)
------------------------------
Every indicator here is the repo's OWN, imported from :mod:`engine.confluence_tiers`:
``_stoch_rsi_kd`` (StochRSI %K/%D), ``_rsi_macd`` (the RSI-MACD pair whose difference is
the histogram), ``_tf_bars`` (the ABSOLUTE session-calendar 2D/3D grid — never
``resample``, see the session-anchor adjudication), ``_to_daily`` and ``_xup``.  There
is no parallel re-implementation of a stochastic or a MACD in this file, and there must
never be one: a second implementation is a second answer, and the board would then
disagree with the plan about whether a name crossed.

AUTHORITY
---------
DISPLAY / ADMISSION-CLASS tier only.  Nothing here originates a signal, a score, or a
rank; it re-CLASSES a row the entry ladder already admitted, and it can refuse a market
entry in favour of a zone.  No directional call is pinned (DNR:KILL-FORCED-CALLS).
Context-conditioned by construction: :func:`assess_early_turn` returns ``fired=False``
whenever neither context is present, no matter how clean the signature looks — four
anecdotes do not carry a promotion, and the §6.8(b) conditional table is what would.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A GEOMETRY score, never a probability score.  It answers "how good is the trade
# available RIGHT NOW", from three things a chart shows and nothing a backtest inferred:
#
#   (a) how far today's entry sits above the structural stop      (lower = better)
#   (b) whether the low that stop hangs under is a CONFIRMED pivot (cleaner = better)
#   (c) how far price has already travelled from the fire         (a chase = worse)
#
# (c) is why this is scored today and not on the signal's birthday: a fire that has run
# +10% off its low is a chase, and it must sort BELOW a fresh one no matter how good the
# original signature looked.
#
# What is deliberately NOT in here, and is test-pinned absent: any durability or P(win)
# claim, the §8 / footprint features that were nulled under risk-equalization, member-share
# theme breadth, and the retracted repeat-fire flag.  The basket TURNING/CONFIRMED read may
# sit BESIDE a row as display context — it has its own forward ledger — but it is not an
# input here.
#: Risk this far above the structural stop scores zero on the risk leg.  Not a threshold
#: anyone may act on — the ordering key's floor, so the leg cannot run away.
GEOMETRY_RISK_CAP: float = 0.15
#: Travel from the fire that fully spends the freshness leg (the operator's "+10% is a
#: chase" example).

#: How much of the score the freshness leg may take away.
GEOMETRY_DECAY_WEIGHT: float = 0.45
#: What a CONFIRMED reference pivot is worth against an unconfirmed raw low.
GEOMETRY_CONFIRMED_BONUS: float = 8.0
#: The decline-low lookback the structural stop hangs under, and the stop's own haircut —
#: the same P_low x 0.99 basis the bake-off measured stop-A survival on.
GEOMETRY_LOW_LOOKBACK: int = 45
GEOMETRY_STOP_K: float = 0.99
#: Radius of the confirmed swing low the stop-structure flag reads.
PIVOT_RADIUS_R3: int = 3

#: The admission lane a row reads from.  A FACT column, never a score and never blended
#: into one: the early lane's geometry score and the confirmed lane's own score stay two
#: numbers.  EARLY is the only value — a confirmed-lane row carries no stage at all
#: (`prophet_bridge` documents that absence-as-design).  The CONFIRMING/CONFIRMED
#: constants that used to sit here were deleted by the §J.9(c) ruling
#: (research/PROPHET_RULING_J9C_J10_LIFECYCLE_CELLS.md §2.4): they were defined and never
#: assigned, and a vocabulary value with no producer is how the estate got an unlightable
#: rail dot.  The public lifecycle vocabulary is `lifecycle_state` (§6), not this column.
