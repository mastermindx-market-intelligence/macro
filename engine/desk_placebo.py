"""Empirical null base rate for the desks' `hit` endpoint. DETERMINISTIC · NEVER-RAISES.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`hit` is a NOT-FALSIFIED metric, not a directional one. A desk thesis logs a falsifier —
"XLY underperforms SPY by more than 5% over 20 sessions" — and `hit` simply means that
condition did NOT occur (engine/desk_scorer.py:140). Its null is therefore nowhere near
0.5: for a typical rel_return falsifier (op '<', threshold −0.05) a coin-flip lean is
*not falsified* roughly 80–85% of the time, because most 20-day windows simply don't drop
5% versus the benchmark. The `level` (fade-fear) endpoint runs the other way — "never made
a new high above entry" is HARSH, with a null well below 0.5.

This is the same error the L6 Phase-0 report flagged for its own floored favorable-excursion
endpoint (base rate ~88%; `research/macro_tx/L6_PHASE0_REPORT.md` "In plain English",
adjudication condition C1: *any future masterplan must treat this endpoint as what it is*).
Comparing a not-falsified rate to 0.5 and calling 0.5 the "coin-flip" null manufactures an
edge out of the endpoint's leniency.

WHAT WE MEASURE
---------------
For every decided thesis we re-evaluate ITS OWN predicate — same instrument, same benchmark,
same window length, same operator and threshold — at EVERY historical entry date in the price
cache. The fraction of those placebo entries that come back not-falsified is that thesis's
null hit-rate p_i: what a no-skill lean on that exact instrument and horizon would score.
The desk's null is the mix-matched mean of its own p_i, so a desk cannot look good merely by
writing lenient falsifiers or by favouring the lenient endpoint kind.

The same sweep yields the null for `dir_accuracy` (q_i) — which is genuinely near 0.5 for a
rel_return lean, but is measured rather than assumed.

Exhaustive over history, so there is no RNG: same inputs → same numbers, every run.

Verified against the live ai_desk ledger: replaying these sweeps at each thesis's ACTUAL
entry date reproduces engine.desk_scorer's recorded hit/miss on 13 of 13, and the `level`
realized values to 4 decimals — so the null describes the same endpoint that was graded. The
one deliberate difference is `start_level`: the scorer prefers the entry close captured at
log time, while a placebo entry at an arbitrary historical date has no such capture and must
use the cached close throughout. That moves realized values by <0.005 and flipped no outcome.

The same replay was run for `theme_rel_return` against the live thematic_desk ledger: at each
thesis's ACTUAL entry date it reproduces engine.thematic_desk._eval's hit/miss on 28 of 28
(every elapsed, priceable thesis as of 2026-07-26; the other 2 are URNM, which has no parquet
on any plane and is `expired` on both sides). The `start_level` difference above applies here
too and is LARGER: the capture-vs-cache gap reaches 0.018 of realized excess on the China
A-share proxies, whose stored history is re-based by every dividend (lib/store.upsert
`overwrite_overlap`), against <0.005 on the US names. It flipped no outcome on any of the 28.
Nothing else diverged — reading the exit off the joined proxy/benchmark index reproduced
_eval's per-series `_close_on_or_after` exactly.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
-------------------
Display-tier accrual is untouched. This module computes a promotion statistic and nothing
else — it never writes a score, a size, or an allocation, and a null never stops a desk from
continuing to log and grade theses.
