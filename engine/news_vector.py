"""News-vector PIT event bus — Stage 1 of the narrative-quantification pipeline.

LEAF · GATED · CONTEXT-ONLY · LLM-DEFAULT-OFF. This is the keystone substrate of
the narrative framework (memory narrative-quant-framework): a first-print,
point-in-time, append-only event store that EVERY later stage reads. Its value is
MEASUREMENT INTEGRITY, not alpha — it makes no forward-return claim, so it cannot
be falsified by one; its bar is a data-quality bar (see tests/test_news_vector.py).

WHAT IT DOES (deterministic, no AI in P0):
  1. FETCH a NARRATIVE-scope GDELT slice (trade/tariffs, geopolitics/conflict,
     industrial-policy, plus the core macro terms) — broader than engine.macro_news,
     because the manufactured-volatility backdrop the dashboard must read (tariff
     scares, Iran/Israel headlines, government stakes in chipmakers) is exactly the
     policy/geo flow macro_news filters OUT. The term list goes out as MULTIPLE
     sub-queries, each under GDELT's server-side query-length limit (_MAX_QUERY_LEN;
     the limit TIGHTENED ~2026-06-20 and rejected the old single query for 3 weeks),
     through engine.gdelt_client's shared cross-process per-IP pace gate.
  2. GATE deterministically — reputable-source allowlist + the shared low-value
     junk filter (news_common.low_value_reason: pick-mill listicles / single-stock
     advertorials / preview roundups — the MN-05 leak class; every drop logged with
     its reason) + a narrative-theme keyword gate (reuses engine.macro_news.filter
     primitives where they overlap), dedup.
  3. KEY each kept headline by a stable content hash (event_id) and ACCRUE it
     append-only with **keep-FIRST** semantics: the FIRST time we saw an event_id is
     recorded as first_seen_utc and is NEVER overwritten on re-ingest. This single
     decision defeats the framework's #1 look-ahead failure mode (news APIs restamp
     on republish); it is the deliberate INVERSE of the prediction-markets snapshot
     accrual (which keeps-LAST, because odds genuinely revise).
  4. STAMP each event with scheduled_ref — whether a HIGH-impact scheduled US macro
     release (FOMC/CPI/NFP/GDP/PCE/PPI, via engine.event_calendar) fell ON the
     article date or the DAY BEFORE (the reaction window — a release tomorrow cannot
     explain today's flow) AND the article's theme sits in that release's macro
     channel (_SCHEDULED_REF_THEMES). This is the deterministic "is this move
     explainable by the calendar, or is it a headline shock?" flag the surprise-
     decomposition needs; a blanket same-window stamp would mark unrelated geo/tech
     headlines as calendar-explained (the MN-06 leak). Forward-only: keep-FIRST
     accrual never restamps already-accrued rows.

DISCIPLINE (enforced, not aspirational):
  • LEAF — imports nothing from the mechanical core (conditions/regime/run/inputs/
    cycles/equity_alloc/*_signals/calibrate); only lib.config and the sibling LEAF
    modules macro_news + event_calendar + news_common. Nothing in any scoring path
    imports this.
  • Every public function returns plain data or None and NEVER raises into the build.
  • The LLM structured-extraction stage is STUBBED OFF in P0 (enabled:false AND
    llm_extract:false). When later enabled it must reuse engine.catalyst_tone's
    citation-verified gates and write its fields as CONTEXT only — never a score.
