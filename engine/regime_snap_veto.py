"""AI knife-vs-dip durability veto for the regime-snap detector (CONTEXT-ONLY).

The regime-snap detector (engine.regime_snap) is VERIFIED COINCIDENT: it confirms a
fast risk-on snap is happening, but its forward returns are ~base-rate, so it
cannot tell a durable relief from a dead-cat bounce. That durability call is the
one judgement a mechanical leg structurally can't make — it turns on the CATALYST
(a signed deal / policy shift vs a verbal head-fake), which lives in the news, not
the price tape. This module makes that call with a single, TRIGGERED LLM call.

Discipline (DECISIONS.md D33 + research/SP_VECTOR_VIABILITY.md):
  * TRIGGERED, not continuous — runs ONLY when a snap is firing/building, so cost is
    O(snap events) (~1-2 a year), never every build.
  * CONTEXT-ONLY — the verdict is shown on the relief-radar card and appended to a
    grading log; it is NEVER a number in any score / size / allocation, and nothing
    in axes / regime / macro_risk / regime_snap reads it. The mechanical core keeps
    its own backtestable track record (D33: keep a mechanical core, an LLM layer on
    top is fine); this is an annotation on top.
  * FIREWALLED + graceful — needs DEEPSEEK_API_KEY; absent the key (or disabled in
    config) it returns None and the card falls back to the deterministic checklist.
  * GROUNDED — it reasons over the deterministic snap state + what's driving the tape
    + recent headlines we already fetch; it is told NOT to fabricate and to answer
    'unclear' (low confidence) when the catalyst isn't legible.
