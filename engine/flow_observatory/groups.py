"""engine.flow_observatory.groups — official/curated lenses, coverage, concentration
and contribution (Flow Observatory V2 W4, ``research/flow_observatory/W4_SPEC.md``).

Pure assembly on top of the SAME kinetics primitives ``engine.flow_velocity`` already
exposes (``kinetics``/``rate_read``/``spark``/``series_tail``/``WK``) — "same math as
the theme rollup ... no second velocity engine" (spec §2A). This module owns three
things neither the theme rollup nor ``engine.flow_observatory.contract`` owned before
W4:

  coverage      n_members / n_covered / coverage_pct per group, and the floor below
                which a group renders ``insufficient coverage`` instead of a partial
                statistic (spec §3 — ``COVERAGE_FLOOR_PCT``, calibrated below).
  overlap       curated themes may share members; ``overlap_count`` (theme-level) and
                the per-member "in N themes" chip data (spec §3).
  concentration top-1/top-3 gross-flow share, the without-top1 sensitivity direction,
                and the per-member contributions that reconcile to the group's own
                relative value within 1e-6 (spec §4).
  aggregate_lens
                the OFFICIAL (Shenwan L1, non-overlapping) sector lens itself — built
                from the SW constituent membership store
                (``data/china_sectors/membership.parquet``, ``collectors.china_sectors
                .collect_sw_membership``) joined onto the SAME per-ticker kinetics map
                (``kmap``) the theme rollup already computed, so a name's velocity is
                identical wherever it appears (matches the existing "the datasets
                breathe together" invariant — engine.flow_velocity's own docstring).

COVERAGE_FLOOR_PCT calibration receipt (spec §3, real data, 2026-09-03): all 22 curated
baskets_china themes sit at 100% coverage today (every basket member is present AND
scored in the flow kinetics map) — any floor at or below 100% keeps every one of them
eligible. The SW L1 official-sector distribution is the real "degenerate tail" the
floor exists to catch: measured against the same kmap (31 groups), coverage ranges
5.1%-90.5% with a natural break at 57.6% -> 62.1% (only Banks 90.5%, Non-bank
Financials 77.2%, and Nonferrous Metals 62.1% clear a 60% floor; the other 28 groups
legitimately have too little of their true membership inside the ~1,800-name Tushare
moneyflow panel to publish a non-survivor-biased read). The starting hypothesis (60%)
sits inside that natural gap and is kept as-is — moving it lower would let in several
sectors where 4 in 5 constituents are silently absent from the read, which is exactly
the "survivor-biased read" gate #0.2 exists to forbid.
