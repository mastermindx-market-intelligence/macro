"""engine.flow_observatory.contract — the ``flow_observatory.v2`` schema (W1).

Pure assembly and validation, no I/O (masterplan §4 module-layout freeze): every function
here takes plain dicts/lists in and returns plain dicts/lists out. ``scripts/build_flow_velocity``
is the only caller that touches disk; tests call these functions directly on fixtures.

The whole point of this module is the honesty gate the program exists to enforce: absolute
flow (did money actually move) and relative pressure (is that fast or slow FOR this series)
are separate fields, separate labels, and — via :func:`quadrant` — a separate four-way read
that can say "still selling, but the pressure is easing" instead of collapsing that into a
single inflow-colored number (the live-page defect this program was commissioned to kill).

    """One block per masterplan §3 leg — ALWAYS all five W1 legs (S7 repair): a leg whose
    panel did not build this run still gets its identity row so the trust strip shows
    "unavailable — not zero flow" rather than a silent hole (masterplan §5 publication
    law). ``sw_l1_sectors`` stays out of scope entirely (W4 — the engine has no panel for
    it at all yet; see the SOURCE_META docstring above for why fabricating one would
    itself violate the honesty gate this module exists to enforce).

    W2: every leg's ``status``/``reasons``/``confidence``/``gap_sessions``/``revised`` now
    come from ``engine.flow_observatory.quality.classify_leg`` (never left ``null`` as W1
    did), with the desk-level wall-clock backstop applied across all five before
    ``ui_state`` is derived (spec §1-§2).

    ``now`` (B1 repair — renamed from ``today``) is the wall-clock anchor for calendar-gap
    legs, and MUST be a real ``datetime`` for production callers (never a bare UTC date fed
    straight to an Asia calendar — the exact forbidden shape B1 closes; see
    ``quality.classify_leg`` / ``quality._newest_completed_session``). ``None`` (the
    default, and every pre-W2 caller) skips staleness measurement entirely, so existing
    callers keep reporting HEALTHY/"current" exactly as before unless they opt in by
    passing a real ``now``. The desk-level wall-clock backstop (``apply_desk_backstop``, the
    ONE calendar-day rule) derives its own coarse ``today`` date FROM ``now`` here rather
    than taking a second explicit parameter — one wall-clock anchor in, and both the
    session-aware per-leg gap and the calendar-day backstop derive their own reading from
    it.
    ``log_rows`` (state_log history) feeds the coverage-collapse/REVISED inputs; omitted or
    empty degrades those two checks to their honest "insufficient/no history" no-ops.

    ``ledger_rows`` (W3 — the observations ledger, ``engine.flow_observatory.history``)
    feeds each leg's ``first_known_at`` (spec §2: "closes the W1 limitation" — previously
    always ``None``): the ``entity_kind='market'`` row's own ``revision_id==0`` first-known
    time for that leg's effective date. Omitted/empty ledger degrades to the honest
    ``None`` every pre-W3 caller already saw (bootstrap: the ledger starts empty).

    HK-market legs (S8): ``sb_aggregate``/``hk_sb_holdings`` anchor their freshness gap
    against the newest HK-family date (sb_aggregate's own effective_date) rather than the
    CN ``market_session`` — the two calendars are not the same trading calendar, so
    comparing an HK leg's date against a CN close date can manufacture a false gap/false
    currency on days the two markets' sessions diverge. CN legs keep the CN anchor.

def validate(desk: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
    """Raise :class:`ContractError` on a ``flow_observatory.v2`` contract violation.

    Builder calls this on the FINAL payload before writing (a violation blocks the v2
    write, never the plain page — see ``scripts/build_flow_velocity``); tests call it
    directly on fixtures. Checks (spec §1.7): missing denominators, quadrant inconsistent
    with its own abs/rel directions, absolute/relative fields disagreeing with their
    direction enums, and the top-level build instant imitating a leg's market date.

    S6 repair: the leg-date check used to compare a leg's ``effective_date`` (always a
    plain ``YYYY-MM-DD`` panel date) against ``generated_at`` verbatim (always a full ISO
    build instant with a time component, e.g. ``"2026-09-01T12:00:00+00:00"``) — two
    values that can never be string-equal regardless of any bug, so the check was dead
    code, unreachable by construction and never exercised by any test. The real invariant
    ("leg effective dates must come from panel-provided dates" — masterplan §5 "build time
    != source time") is now enforced two ways: (1) every non-null effective_date must
    actually BE a plain calendar date — a build instant substituted in for it is
    recognizably NOT that shape (has a "T", wrong length) and is rejected on sight, with
    zero false-positive risk against a real T+0 leg whose date legitimately coincides with
    today's build date; (2) the original byte-identical comparison is kept as a
    defense-in-depth belt-and-suspenders check.

    S3 repair (five checks, each with its own failing-first test in
    tests/test_flow_observatory_quality.py): (a) every ``sources[]`` block's ``status`` is
    non-null AND drawn from the enum — previously a null status only failed silently
    elsewhere, never here; (b) ``publication_state`` is now a REQUIRED top-level key, not a
    soft "only check it if present" — a payload that omits it entirely used to sail through
    unchecked; (c) ``market_read.{themes,names}.quality`` must reflect the cn proxy's status
    for BOTH STALE ("stale") and UNAVAILABLE ("unavailable") — the old check only ever
    covered STALE; (d) ``health.publication_state`` must equal the top-level
    ``publication_state`` — the two are supposed to be the SAME number by construction, but
    nothing enforced that machine/UI agreement; (e) every leg's ``ui_state`` must equal
    ``ui_state_from_status(status, reasons)`` — the machine (status) and the UI (ui_state)
    reading are validated to agree, never merely assumed to.
