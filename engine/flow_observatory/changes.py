"""engine.flow_observatory.changes — state_log.jsonl (W1 minimal precursor) + change_summary.

``data/flow_observatory/state_log.jsonl`` is the minimal precursor to W3's full
append-only observations ledger (masterplan §5): one line per valid market session,
carrying just enough per-theme state to derive rank_change / state_started /
state_age_sessions / prior_state and the "what changed today" diff going forward, with
honest "first tracked session" nulls until history accrues.

Advance gate: ``engine.ledger_lane.asia_advance_enabled() or nightly_advance_enabled()``
— house law, the group_pulse precedent (``engine/group_pulse.py``
``advance_episode_ledger``): nightly/asia-close are the SOLE advancers of forward
ledgers; intraday/manual lanes compute and discard. Idempotent per session: a rerun on
the same session REPLACES that session's own line (never duplicates it); every other
session's line is left byte-identical.

W3 module-layout split (masterplan §4 freeze): this file (``state_log.jsonl`` +
``compute_changes``) stays the run/health journal and the "what changed today" diff
entry point. ``engine.flow_observatory.history`` (new) owns the full append-only,
revision-safe PRODUCT observation ledger (``data/flow_observatory/observations.parquet``)
that state age/onset/prior-state/rank-change and ``sources[].first_known_at`` derive from
once it is deep enough — ``compute_changes`` below now reads FROM the ledger when
``ledger_rows`` is supplied and holds ≥2 theme sessions, falling back to this file's
state_log path otherwise (both paths tested, spec §2/§3 test 10).

Belief-identity split (B2, W3 repair round): the LEDGER'S OWN revision comparison
(``history.append_observations``/``_diff_entities``) covers PRODUCT fields only (vel,
abs_value, quadrant, state, rank) — a leg's ``status``/``coverage_n`` context never mints a
ledger revision on its own. That is why ``revised_ids`` here (built from
``revisions[].id``) only ever suppresses a transition/rank-mover for a GENUINE product
correction, never for routine same-session staleness flapping: health/staleness HISTORY
stays this file's own job (``health.legs``/``health.runs`` below), never the ledger's.

Baseline unification (M9, W3 repair round): quality_transitions used to ALWAYS compare
against ``previous_valid_entry(log_rows, before_session=session)`` — state_log's own idea
of "most recent before today" — even when the ledger (a DIFFERENT source, keyed on its own
previous-valid-session) was already driving transitions/rank_movers above. The two could
name different "yesterday"s in one payload. ``compute_changes`` now looks the state_log
health baseline up at EXACTLY the same ``prev_session`` the transitions branch just
settled on (ledger-derived when ``ledger_ready``, state_log-native otherwise) — never an
independently re-derived answer that can silently diverge from it.
