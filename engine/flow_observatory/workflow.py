"""engine.flow_observatory.workflow — W6 research workflow (frozen
``research/flow_observatory/W6_SPEC.md``): per-group history drawer, group compare,
prior episodes, Terminal deep links, and the watch-store integration decision.

Pure — every function here takes its inputs explicitly (a flow series, ledger rows,
the pre-computed causal series, a lens tag) and returns a plain dict/list; no I/O and
no re-fetching from disk. ``scripts/build_flow_velocity.py`` is the only caller that
touches disk (the flow panel, membership stores, the observations ledger) and wires
these functions' output into ``site/flowdata/desk.json``.

Replay honesty (spec §0.2): every number here comes from :func:`compute_full_series`,
which is a THIN wrapper over ``engine.flow_velocity.kinetics_series`` — the SAME
rolling/causal transform the live board itself uses, just read at every prior session
instead of only the last one (see that function's own docstring: a rolling/trailing
transform is already point-in-time at every one of its own output rows, so slicing its
history is a genuine causal replay, not a second computation that could quietly
diverge from what the desk actually publishes). Nothing here ever originates a signal;
this module only presents history/comparison/episode CONTEXT for a display that is
already display-only (masterplan §13 no-fused-composite boundary).
