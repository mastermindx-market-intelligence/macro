"""Deterministic root-cause forensics for US Buy-Board episodes (Prophet Learning Loop §2).

WHAT THIS MODULE IS
-------------------
A pure classifier + aggregator. Given (a) an episode's outcome, (b) the board's OWN
state at the entry date, (c) the price path over the holding window, and (d) the
ticker's prior episode, it emits a multi-label failure taxonomy where every label
carries the trigger values that fired it. `scripts/prophet_postmortem.py` owns all the
I/O (parquet, jsonl, git archaeology, closes caches, artifact write); this file owns the
rules, so the rules are testable on synthetic rows with no fixtures.

FOUR THINGS THIS MODULE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
------------------------------------------------
1. **No LLM anywhere** (constitution A7 — LLMs never originate signals). Every label is
   a feature-threshold rule with its threshold as a module constant and its trigger
   values written onto the row. A reader can re-derive any label by hand.
2. **No authority.** Nothing here ranks, sizes, gates or vetoes. A cohort that looks
   damning (say: every loser was bought under an `avoid` theme) is a CANDIDATE for a
   pre-registered study, not a live rule. That is why `veto_cost` below is symmetric —
   see WINNERS ARE FIRST-CLASS.
3. **No re-definition of the track record.** The scoring core is
   `engine.track_scoring` used unchanged: next-bar-close fill, forced verdict at
   `horizon`, symmetric maturity gate. This study runs the PURE fixed-horizon leg (no
   stop, no oscillator target) so the postmortem measures the SIGNAL, while the public
   ledger keeps its own exit rule. The two therefore differ by exactly the exit rule's
   effect (e.g. IPGP 2026-07-15: -17.9% fixed-horizon here vs -18.7% in the ledger,
   which stopped out on day 8). Neither is wrong; they answer different questions.
4. **No pooling of matured and in-flight rows into a rate.** An in-flight row is marked
   to the latest close, and a mark is outcome-conditioned in the exact way
   track_scoring rule 2 exists to prevent: today's biggest losers are over-represented
   among names that have not yet resolved. In-flight episodes are CLASSIFIED (that is
   the forensic value — a worst-rows list is largely made of names that have not yet
   finished) and are then held in a separate, labelled block that enters NO rate and NO
   expectancy. The corollary is that a cohort label read off such a row is a MARK with a
   shelf life: five of the operator's eleven worst names on 2026-07-31 were still open,
   and one of them (FN 07-21) closed +1.66%. See `path_tails`.
   `aggregate()` enforces this structurally: every rate is computed over
   `maturity == "matured"` only.

WINNERS ARE FIRST-CLASS (the symmetric cost column)
---------------------------------------------------
The failure taxonomy is only half an answer. "Every loser had a sector headwind at
entry" is worthless on its own, because the winners may have had one too — a headwind
veto that removes six losers and eight winners is a losing trade. So the same labels
are computed for winners (>= +8%), and `veto_cost` reports, for every costable claim
(one row per label-and-leg, `VETO_COST_SPECS`), BOTH sides of the counterfactual: losses
avoided AND winners forfeited, with the net. The winners-forfeited column is a column,
never a footnote.

SYSTEMIC VS ANOMALOUS
---------------------
A label that fires on nine episodes across one board night is one bad night; the same
label across seven nights is a process fault. `aggregate()` therefore counts label share
over DISTINCT ENTRY DATES as well as over rows, and prints the largest single-date
share, because episodes surfaced on the same night are one bet (track_scoring rule 3).

THE LABELS (§2 of research/PROPHET_LEARNING_LOOP_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  sector_headwind   theme/sector basket reco in {avoid, trim} at entry, or the board's
                    own spotlight read was `out_of_play` / stage `lagging`.
                    VISIBLE AT ENTRY. `weakening` (the RRG leading-but-rolling
                    quadrant) is recorded in the context and deliberately does NOT
                    fire — it is not yet a headwind, and folding it in would push the
                    label's base rate past half the board and make it uninformative.
  bought_extended   extension evidence at entry: the alignment read said overextended /
                    "Extended — wait", the entry-status was `extended`, the conviction
                    risk carried an `ext` component, or the fill price sat above the
                    board's own `chase_above` level. VISIBLE AT ENTRY.
  thesis_break      the setup itself failed: a later board night stamped
                    `hold.state == "broken"`, else a close crossed below the entry
                    row's published stop. NOT visible at entry.
  gap_event         a single-session close-to-close move <= -8% against the position.
                    Earnings/news class. NOT visible at entry. Close-to-close is the
                    honest available measure — the caches carry no opens, so a true
                    overnight gap is UNDER-counted, never over-counted.
  market_beta       the tape, not the pick: |excess| < 40% of |absolute| loss.
                    NOT visible at entry.
  re_admission      the same ticker was re-admitted <= 10 sessions after a prior
                    episode, on either of two legs that are NOT the same claim:
                      * `open_drawdown_at_readmit` — the prior position was ALREADY
                        >= 8% under water on the night of the re-admission. BUILDABLE.
                      * `prior_episode_loss` — the prior episode RESOLVED to a >= 8%
                        loss. HINDSIGHT (the operator's IPGP case was +3.04% GREEN on
                        the night the board bought it back).
                    NOT visible at entry as a label — see BUILDABLE VS HINDSIGHT.
  idiosyncratic     none of the above fired. Not a residual bucket to be proud of —
                    a large idiosyncratic share means the taxonomy is not yet
                    explaining the losses.

BUILDABLE VS HINDSIGHT (why `re_admission` is not a visible-at-entry label)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
`VISIBLE_AT_ENTRY_LABELS` is a promise: every label in it could have been read off the
board's own state on the night of the pick, so costing a veto out of it answers a
question somebody could act on. `re_admission` fails that promise. Its headline
counterfactual (+79.08pp avoided over 7 flagged episodes, 2026-07-31 artifact) is
carried ENTIRELY by the `prior_episode_loss` leg, which needs the prior episode's
RESOLVED outcome — a number that does not exist on the night the board re-admits the
name. Leaving the label in the visible-at-entry list published a hindsight figure under
a buildable badge, which is the exact error the promotion gauntlet exists to prevent.
So:

  * the label sits OUTSIDE `VISIBLE_AT_ENTRY_LABELS`;
  * `veto_cost` carries ONE ROW PER LEG (`VETO_COST_SPECS`), each stamped
    `variant: buildable | hindsight_upper_bound`;
  * the buildable row is PRINTED EVEN WHEN IT FIRES ZERO TIMES. On today's data it
    fires zero times, and that zero is the finding — suppressing an empty row would
    leave only the hindsight number on the page, which is how a hindsight number gets
    read as a rule.

The per-ROW `visible_at_entry` flag stays leg-specific: an episode that fired on the
open-drawdown leg really was visible at entry and says so on the row. The label-level
list is the weaker, safer claim, and it is the one the aggregations, the report and the
admin panel read.

NULLS ARE PRINTED, NEVER DROPPED
--------------------------------
A ticker with no close path cannot be asked about gaps or stop crosses. Those labels
come back as an explicit null entry in `labels_null` with a reason, the episode still
appears in the artifact, and `aggregate()` reports the null counts per label so a
reader can see the denominator each label was actually evaluated on. The same holds one
level down for `re_admission`: a prior episode that could not be priced, or an
in-window prior with no mark, nulls the LEG it starves (`re_admission:<leg>`) so each
veto variant is costed only over the rows its own input reached.
