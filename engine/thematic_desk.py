"""AI Desk for Thematic Investing — an accountable LLM reasoning layer on the
Narrative-Rotation pages (allocation*.html), one desk per market (US/China/HK/Canada).

This is the sibling of engine.ai_desk (the macro/sector desk) pointed at THEMES instead of
GICS sectors. It reuses that chassis's discipline — quant DETECTS → AI JUDGES → track-record
GATES — without touching the live macro desk:

  gather → an LLM analyst turns the deterministic narrative_rotation state into a SHORT set
  of FALSIFIABLE, check-by-date leans → each is logged to an append-only ledger → a scorer
  grades them against realized proxy-vs-benchmark returns → the track record feeds back so
  conviction self-calibrates.

HONEST BY CONSTRUCTION (the whole point — see scripts/thematic_rotation_phase0.py):
  * cross-sectional theme momentum has rank-IC ~0; rotation-timing has NO validated forward
    edge; the only validated edge is DRAWDOWN control via the absolute-trend gate. So the AI
    cannot "predict the next narrative". Its leans are FALLIBLE HYPOTHESES expressed as
    falsifiable conditionals — graded over time — NOT edge extracted from the detectors.
  * it inherits, inline, the narrative_rotation ai_handoff `do_not_conclude` fences (no
    fade, no sizing, crowding = size-down only, inflows/attention ≠ buy, no next-theme call).
  * DISPLAY-ONLY: nothing here feeds any score/size/axis. The desk grades ITSELF.

Scorability: a theme is gradable only when its basket carries a SCALAR `etf_proxy`
(membership.json → surfaced in allocation.json ranks). overweight ⇒ FALSE if the proxy
underperforms the market benchmark by ≥ threshold over the horizon; avoid/underweight ⇒
the mirror. No proxy (or a blend) → the lean is logged `soft` and never scored (honest).

LLM = DeepSeek via engine.master_brain._call_model (the same gated client the macro desk
uses); when the key/feature is off the desk degrades to no theses and the page shows only
the deterministic handoff contract.
