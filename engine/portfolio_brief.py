"""Deterministic portfolio-brief composer — "your book, through the desk's eyes".

Portfolio-Aware Intelligence, W1 (charter:
research/PORTFOLIO_BRIEF_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md §1 V1, §2, §4). This is the ONE
composer that serves three homes: the macro-api endpoint (GET /api/portfolio/brief),
the Brain tool (get_portfolio_brief), and — through the endpoint's proxy — the
mastermind-terminal Portfolio page (which is already built against the v1 contract
below).

DESIGN-TIER LAW (§4). This module RE-EXPRESSES the nightly per-ticker context
artifact (portfolio_ctx.v1, baked by scripts/build_portfolio_ctx.py). It originates
NOTHING — no new signal, score, classification, threshold, or number of its own. It
JOINS the user's holdings against the artifact and renders deterministic bilingual
sentences. Guardrails, all hard:
  * Descriptive, never prescriptive — exposures, counts, dates, plain-word desk
    stances applied to the book. No "sell X / buy Y / rebalance to Z", no imperatives,
    no model-originated targets. The composed lines pass the ask_brain advice filter
    UNTOUCHED by construction (asserted in tests).
  * Vocabulary VERBATIM from the ctx — conviction_en/zh, label_en/zh, name/name_zh,
    rotation_state, entry label/state — copied, never paraphrased into a judgement.
  * No fabricated numbers. Percentages are whole-number rounded; weights are
    renormalized ONLY over the names that carry the relevant field (never invent a
    sector for an uncovered name).
  * The word "validated" appears NOWHERE.
  * Pure dict/list math — no pandas, no I/O. Determinism: same inputs → byte-identical
    output (the caller passes fixed today/generated_at; golden-file tests pin it).

W6 — POPULATION DISCLOSURE (packet amendment A8). The brief now states, as a first-class
field, WHICH SET OF NAMES it computed over: `positions` (the user's held positions) or
`watchlist_union` (the union of their watchlist symbols, equal-weighted). This program's
founding defect was exactly this hole — a panel headed "your book" composed from a
watchlist, sitting above a table showing a third population, with nothing on screen
saying the three were different sets. The composer CANNOT derive the population (only
the loader that read Supabase knows which query answered), so it is PASSED IN; when a
caller does not pass one the brief says `unspecified` and prints a plain-word line
saying the set was not declared, rather than assuming "positions" and lying quietly.
Every consumer-facing sentence that summarizes the book — headline included — carries
the population, and equal-weighted watchlist analysis is labeled with A8's exact
words: "Watchlist structure — equal weighted".

Note the two axes are INDEPENDENT and must not be conflated: `population` is WHICH NAMES
(positions vs watchlist_union), `weighting` is HOW THEY ARE SIZED (by cost basis vs
equal). A positions population can be equal-weighted (positions with no cost basis
recorded), so neither field implies the other.

# (the W3 lane) or artifacts this endpoint does not read. Emitting them as nulls would
# read as "the desk abstained" when the truth is "this composer cannot see it", so the
# keys are omitted and the gap is named in the PR body as the follow-up wave. What ships
# here is exactly what the composer can derive from the weights the user supplied plus
# the ctx it already reads: pure arithmetic, no new signal, no threshold, no ranking.
#
# Omission is only honest if it is VISIBLE, so `data.not_computed` names the absent legs
# and says why. Without it a machine consumer cannot tell three very different things
# apart: "this composer does not compute posture", "posture was computed and came back
