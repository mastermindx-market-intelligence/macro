"""Prophet US miss-audit + conversion telemetry — nightly MEASUREMENT, ZERO authority.

Productionizes ``research/prophet_us_audit/runner_exclusion_audit.py`` (frozen results:
``research/prophet_us_audit/RESULTS_2026-08-03.md``) as the nightly instrument the Prophet US
trend-intelligence program grades itself against
(``research/PROPHET_US_TREND_INTELLIGENCE_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md`` §W0).

WHAT IT MEASURES (nightly, over the committed S&P-1500 close caches)

  A. RUNNER EXCLUSION — the top-150 names by 63-session return (and the top-50 by 21-session):
     for each, whether it is eligible TODAY and, when it is not, WHICH leg excluded it
     (``not_topped_veto(stoch_ob+stoch_bear+macd_bear)`` / ``rsi_cap_on_fresh_cross`` /
     ``freshness_expired`` / ``no_recent_3d_stoch_cross`` / ``no_cross``), plus how many of the
     trailing 63 sessions it WAS eligible and the date it first became eligible in that window.

  B. SIGHTING -> PLAN CONVERSION — of the runners the engine actually saw (>=1 eligible day in
     the window), how many ever became a Prophet plan (``site/prophet/plans/*.json``, by asset).

  C. THEME-REPRESENTATION LATENCY — for the top-5 themes by ``emerging_score`` in
     ``site/marketdata/subsector_rotation.json``, how many members are present in the
     ``us_standouts`` buy / ran / leaders lanes today.

  D. SUMMARY — universe n, eligible-today n (both bases), excluder histogram, and the
     runner-sector vs eligible-sector histograms that show the mismatch.

  F. BASKET-GRAIN MISSES — "the gold question", automated. Sections A-C ask whether the
     engine saw a NAME. This one asks the altitude above it: did a whole THEME run with
     nobody on the board? For every curated US basket (``data/baskets/membership.json``,
     point-in-time dated membership) the equal-weight 5d and 10d member returns, that
     10d return's percentile inside the basket's OWN trailing-252-session 10d history,
     and how many of its members are on any visible board lane. A basket in its own top
     decile with ZERO members visible is a named miss row. Motivated by the 2026-08-05
     missed-ignitions audit: ``b-gold_miners`` printed Trough/BUY in the sector-cycle
     forward log while the Act board had it on reduce/avoid, and no instrument anywhere
     counted "this basket ignited and we showed nobody".

  E. NAME_SCORE SCORECARD — the forward grade of the per-name POTENTIAL score
     (``engine/name_score_grader.py`` → ``data/name_score/us_calls.parquet``): rank-IC at
     21d/63d with the per-date cross-section behind it, the buy-tier hit rate, and P@k
     against each date's own graded cross-section. Wired here because the score is LIVE and
     LOAD-BEARING while unmeasured — the board's displayed ``conviction.score`` IS
     name_score's ``potential_score`` (a backward-compat overwrite in
     ``scripts/build_stock_library.py``) — and the grader that already runs nightly was
     consumed by NOTHING. Read-only telemetry: no threshold, no alarm, no gate; every null
     is printed with a plain reason (roadmap
     ``research/PROPHET_US_SUPERINTELLIGENCE_ROADMAP_BY_FABLE.md`` §4.4 action 1).

  F. PRIORITY_SCORE SCORECARD — the forward grade of the board's PRIORITY score,
     over the FULL analyzed universe.  ``engine/us_prophet_grades.py`` grades every stamped
     Context Vector row (~1,579 names a night, not the ~12 that become plans) at H=10/21
     sessions excess-vs-SPY; this block joins those outcomes to the score the system gave
     each name that night and reports rank-IC, P@k (k=1/5/10/25), a decile lift table and
     the per-decile loser rate — the operator's question (2026-08-05) in its bluntest form:
     "it would be a disaster if high-scored names underperform."  Because EVERY name is
     graded, a pick's hit is judged against that night's whole universe rather than against
     the picks alone — something the plan-only record could never do.  Read-only telemetry:
     no threshold, no alarm, no gate; coverage is disclosed (the builder computes the
     itemized legs on the buy lane only, so most stamped rows carry no score, and a missing
     score is a null, never a zero).  Masterplan
     ``research/PROPHET_US_TREND_INTELLIGENCE_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md`` §W7.3.

BASES (two, named — they are NOT interchangeable)

  ``tier_stream``  the vectorized per-day production twin of ``cascade``, on COMPLETED buckets.
                   T1 is taken via cascade's own raw-3D-cross fallback, so the stream is a
                   self-contained close-only signal. This is the basis for BOTH the runner
                   today-verdict and the 63-session eligibility window, so the two can never
                   disagree about the same day.
  ``cascade``      the scalar last-bar production call, no ``take_active`` (no §7 master
                   supplied here), provisional resample tail. This reproduces the frozen
                   "cascade-eligible today = 38" headline. It is a STRICTER set than the
                   stream basis because raw-3D-cross T1 needs ``take_active``.

  Neither is the live board's basis: the board additionally runs ``signal_gate``'s
  take/pending/early paths over a wider universe (1,579 names incl. Russell + curated extras),
  which is why its ``eligible`` count is larger. The per-runner ``gate_*`` fields carry the
  production ``signal_gate`` verdict + ``near_miss_reason`` for exactly that comparison.

  The excluder ATTRIBUTION reuses ``confluence_tiers``' own helpers and constants
  (``_tf_bars``/``_rsi_macd``/``_stoch_rsi_kd``/``_xup``/``_since``/``_to_daily``/
  ``_ticks_since`` + ``OB``/``OS``/``CONF_W``/``BUY_RSI_MAX``/``FRESH_TICKS``) to name WHICH
  leg is down. It never decides eligibility — that verdict always comes from ``tier_stream``.
  There is no forked copy of the tier math in this module.

ZERO AUTHORITY (house law). This is ops telemetry. Nothing may read it for rank, gate, size,
membership, or any user-facing claim; no module outside ``scripts/run_prophet_miss_audit.py``
and the tests imports it. It writes ONLY ``data/prophet_miss_audit/`` and mutates no other
store on any path.

NIGHTLY-ONLY LAW (nightly is the SOLE advancer of forward ledgers). ``run(advance=True)`` —
reached only via ``python -m scripts.run_prophet_miss_audit --nightly`` — is the only path
that writes the real artifact or appends to the forward log. A default (intraday / re-render /
local) invocation computes and prints, and writes NOTHING; ``--out-dir DIR`` runs the full
write into a scratch dir, never the real store. The forward-log append is idempotent on
``price_through``: a second nightly run on the same price date appends nothing.

DETERMINISM. No wall clock anywhere: every result is keyed by ``price_through`` (the caches'
own last bar). Two runs over the same caches produce byte-identical artifacts.

FAIL-SOFT, NEVER SILENT. A missing/unreadable optional input degrades to nulls AND appends a
row to the artifact's ``degraded`` list naming the path and the reason. A missing close cache
is fatal (there is nothing to measure).

Run (nightly / DAG):   python -m scripts.run_prophet_miss_audit --nightly
Run (safe local test): python -m scripts.run_prophet_miss_audit --out-dir /tmp/pma
Run (dry, no writes):  python -m scripts.run_prophet_miss_audit

    """A per-ticker MEMOIZED close-series resolver, identical to the resolution half of
    ``engine.name_score_grader._fwd_return``.

    WHY THIS EXISTS (runtime, not method). ``grade()`` originally resolved the series
    inside a per-(row, horizon) loop, so a 72k-row ledger cost ~145k parquet reads —
    MEASURED at 13.4 minutes and rising with every night's stamp, which is a fifth of the
    whole render budget for telemetry no gate reads. The ledger's 72k rows span only ~3k
    tickers, so reading each name ONCE and reusing the series makes the same computation
    cost ~3s. The read count is bounded by the UNIVERSE (stable), not by ledger depth
    (accruing), so this stays cheap as the ledger grows. ``grade()`` now carries the same
    per-name memo (``name_score_grader._series_reader`` — same shape, added after this
    adapter proved it); this reader stays the audit's OWN resolution so the anti-fork pin
    compares two implementations rather than one through a pointer.

    It is a caching wrapper, NOT a second opinion: the group ladder
    (``name_score_grader._FWD_GROUP``), the ``close`` coercion, and the US dead-name
    extension (``engine.grading.resolve_series``) are the grader's, and the forward return
    itself is taken from ``engine.grading.grade_next_bar_return`` — the same call
    ``_fwd_return`` makes. ``tests/test_prophet_miss_audit.py`` pins the whole block against
    a live ``name_score_grader.grade()`` run on a synthetic ledger, so a drift in either
    module fails the suite rather than shipping a second set of numbers.

    """Runner-exclusion audit over the liquidity-floored SCAN universe.

    Identical instrument to section A, pointed at a different frame: the runner
    verdict comes from ``ct.tier_stream`` and the excluder from
    ``attribute_excluder`` — the SAME functions the curated audit uses, not a
    parallel implementation. Only the universe differs.

    The point of the block is the ``off_index`` count: a scan-tier runner is a
    name the curated frame could not have rejected, because it was never in the
    frame. Reporting it as "missed" alongside the curated misses would blur two
    different failures, so the taxonomy names it separately —
    ``not_in_curated_universe`` is a COVERAGE fact, not a gate verdict.

    ``tickers``/``floor`` let a caller that ALREADY resolved the universe hand it
    in, so the runner lane pays the 30-second store census once instead of twice
    (it needs the same set to stamp the context vector). Omit both and this
    function resolves it itself.

    Fail-soft: with no store restored in this lane the document is a disclosed
    null carrying the reason, never an empty runner list that reads as "no
    off-index runners tonight".
