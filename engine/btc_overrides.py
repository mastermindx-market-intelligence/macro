"""Override-Registry apply layer for the Bitcoin Vector.

ARCHITECTURE (Override-Registry Program, W0 + W2 + W4):

  allocation() in btc_signals is now a PURE ENGINE — it computes the
  (momentum × risk × conviction × brake × overlay) allocation without any
  post-hoc masking. Human conviction overrides are DECLARED in config.yml
  under `vector.overrides:` and APPLIED here as the final word.

  apply(alloc_df, cfg, ctx=None) -> DataFrame
    Input  : the pure engine alloc_df (columns alloc_<name> for each variant)
    Output : the same frame PLUS, for every alloc_<name> column:
               alloc_<name>       final: scaled by the override release fraction
                                  (0.0 fully gated — IDENTICAL to the pre-W0
                                  live values; raw × frac while the W4 staged
                                  re-entry fills; raw after release)
               alloc_<name>_raw   the pure engine input, untouched
             and cross-variant index columns:
               override_active        int8 0/1 — 1 on every bar where an
                                      override suppresses (fully or partially)

                                      "class1_ath_invalidation"

  CLASS-1 AUTO-RELEASE (W2; owner decision D1, recorded 2026-07-02):
  the registry may declare a `structural_invalidation` release rule
  (signal: new_ath_close). The invalidation is ANCHOR-INDEPENDENT — a new
  all-time-high daily close (close > running historical max), NOT a comparison
  against a hand-set anchor date — held for `confirm_days` CONSECUTIVE closes
  above the broken prior ATH. On confirm the gate steps down to the engine's
  raw allocation (the brake/conviction stack then governs) for the REMAINDER
  of that override window. confirm_days is pre-committed in the masterplan and
  counted in the registry `dof_cost`; it must never be re-tuned.

  W4 — STAGED AUTO RE-ENTRY (owner decision D4; masterplan N5 as REDESIGNED
  2026-07-02 after the W1 trigger eval — research/BTC_REENTRY_TRIGGER_EVAL.md
  failed ALL SIX candidate evidence triggers against the pre-registered bar,
  so no evidence signal holds tranche AUTHORITY):
    • CALENDAR-SCHEDULED TRANCHE SPINE (the authority): the gate's release
      edge moves from election day to the thesis monitor's projected bottom
      window (cycle top + btc_cycle_thesis.WIN_LEAD_D days; 2026: Oct 1 —
      the old buy_lead_days calendar released AFTER the projected bottom).
      Tranches fill ON SCHEDULE — T1 40% at window open, T2 30% +30d,
      T3 30% +60d — deterministic, zero evidence DOF, each sized against
      the engine's RAW allocation.
    • EVIDENCE ACCELERATORS ONLY (never blockers/vetoes): one registered
      rule — a fresh MVRV-Z<0 print (≥90d non-negative prior) OR a fresh
      bottom_pressure≥0.45 cross (≥20d below prior) INSIDE the window pulls
      the NEXT scheduled tranche forward to that day. Bounded loss by
      construction: evidence can only move a fill EARLIER inside an
      already-committed window.
    • the owner halt switch (reentry.halt_from) freezes scheduled fills and
      accelerator pulls from that date; it does NOT halt the Class-1 release
      (D1 is its own governance instrument);
    • Class-1 composes: EARLIEST full release wins (a confirmed structural
      invalidation any time inside the engagement steps straight to raw and
      moots the remaining schedule).
  When no projected window is computable for an engagement (e.g. 2014 — no
  recorded prior cycle top), the legacy election-day release applies,
  bit-identical to W0/W2.

  Every override that sizes money must be graded.  The registry declaration in
  config.yml (vector.overrides) is the governance instrument; the sub-claim
  grading ledger lives in engine/btc_override_ledger.py (W5) and consumes the
  override columns this module emits.  W4 re-entry EVENTS (tranche fills /
  releases, with evidence) append to data/vector/reentry_ledger.jsonl
  (sync_ledger below) — a SEPARATE file from W5's override_ledger.jsonl, which
  is a per-date surface rewritten by its scorer (incompatible schema; two
  writers on one JSONL would clobber each other).  total_dof() feeds the
  declared dof_cost into the DSR trial budget (scripts/calibrate_vector.py) —
  the registry makes DOF more expensive, never cheaper.

  The midterm-election blackout is currently the sole registered override.
  It delegates blackout-window computation to btc_signals.midterm_blackout()
  so that tests/test_btc_signals.py::test_midterm_blackout_windows keeps
  passing unchanged.

    Definition (masterplan §4 N2, overfit-hawk approved):
      - a confirm sequence STARTS on a close strictly above the running
        historical max of all prior closes (a new-ATH close);
      - the broken prior ATH is FROZEN as the confirm reference for the

      - on the `confirm_days`-th consecutive qualifying close the event FIRES
        and the machine resets — the event is CONSUMED. It is a one-bar EVENT,
