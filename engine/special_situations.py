"""Special Situations classifier engine (Phase-1 — display-only leaf).

Turns the raw EDGAR event rows collected by `collectors.special_situations` into
classified, floored, cross-border-tagged situations for the Special Situations
desk. DISPLAY-ONLY: `SCORED = False`, imports nothing from the scoring path
(`conditions`/`regime`/`run`), and the snapshot is flagged `is_context_only`.

Classification is deterministic, distilled from the reverse-engineered taxonomy
(research/SPECIAL_SITUATIONS_RECON_FINDINGS.md §D2/§B1):
- Structured forms (SC 13D, SC TO, SC 13E3, merger proxies, Form 25/15/10) map
  straight to a mature category — high precision, no document text needed.
- Decisive 8-K items (1.02/1.03/3.01/5.02) map directly.
- Ambiguous 8-K items (1.01/2.01/8.01), 6-K and 424B5 need the filing TEXT to
  disambiguate (Acquisition vs Divestiture vs Spin-Off vs Strategic Review vs a
  plain shelf raise). Those are returned status="defer" and handled by the text
  lane (P1.1b) — NOT guessed here, to keep the desk clean.
- Passive Schedule 13G is status="skip" (tracked only to spot a 13G→13D flip).

A cross-filing rule upgrades a merger proxy / third-party tender to Going-Private
when the same filer also filed an SC 13E-3 (affiliate take-private), per §B1.
