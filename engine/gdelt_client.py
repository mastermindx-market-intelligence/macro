"""Shared GDELT fetch client for all artlist callers.

LEAF · CONTEXT-ONLY · DISPLAY-TIER. is_context_only=True.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
GDELT's free API enforces one request every 5 seconds per IP.  As of 2026-06-20
the nightly pipeline had nine modules hitting the same endpoint in uncoordinated
bursts; the shared runner IP entered a rate-limit penalty box and has returned 429
on every request since.  This module is the single HTTP funnel that all GDELT
artlist callers must route through so the per-IP pacing rule is honoured globally,
not per-module.

Nine caller modules were identified:
  engine/news_vector.py, engine/news_common.py, engine/macro_news.py,
  engine/china_news.py, engine/catalyst_stock.py, engine/catalyst_tone.py,
  engine/commodity_news.py, engine/missing_tape_gdelt.py, collectors/hk_gdelt.py

engine/missing_tape_gdelt.py and collectors/hk_gdelt.py use the timeline (not
artlist) endpoint with their own Session/urllib transport, and engine/macro_news.py
keeps its own fetch loop (separate lane owns its rework) — those three pace
through the PUBLIC wait_turn() gate below instead of get_articles, so the whole
repo still shares ONE per-IP budget.

THROTTLE MECHANISM
------------------
A stamp file under data/gdelt/last_request is locked with fcntl.flock before each
request.  The lock-holder reads the stamp, sleeps until >= min_interval seconds have
passed, writes a fresh stamp, then releases the lock before issuing the HTTP request.
This gives cross-process serialisation on a single machine (all nightly jobs run on
the same Mac Studio).

RETRY POLICY (bounded to stay under render budget)
---------------------------------------------------
  429 -> sleep 30s -> one retry
  429 again -> sleep 75s -> final retry
  429 on final -> return (None, 'rate_limited')
  non-200 or non-json -> return (None, 'fetch_error')
  Worst-case total wait per call: ~6s throttle + 30s + 75s < 2.5 minutes.
  Never raises.

CIRCUIT BREAKER (keeps a boxed IP off the critical path)
--------------------------------------------------------
When a call exhausts its retries with a persistent 429, the shared IP is in
GDELT's rate-limit penalty box (it has 429'd on every request since 2026-06-20).
Paying the ~2-minute backoff on EVERY subsequent call is what turned the nightly
news sweep into a 26-29 min critical-path stall (build_news alone). So a terminal
429 arms a cross-process breaker (data/gdelt/rate_limit_until, a wall-clock
stamp): for the next gdelt.rate_limit_cooldown_s seconds (default 900) every live
fetch short-circuits to (None, 'rate_limited') WITHOUT throttling or touching the
network. A fresh cache is still served during the cooldown; a single successful
fetch clears the breaker at once. Off-switch: set the cooldown to 0.

CACHE SEMANTICS
---------------
If cache_path is given and a fresh file (age < cache_ttl_s) exists, the cached
articles are returned immediately WITHOUT hitting the network.  On a successful
response the result is written to cache_path.  Failures are NEVER cached — caching
a failure would suppress retries for the full TTL and silently stall accrual stores.
