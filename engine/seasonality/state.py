"""Lane 6 — the Neural Web shadow lobe: per-symbol expiring context states.

This module turns the committed calendar-clock artifacts (Lane 1/2/4) into
compact ``neuralweb.biopharma_seasonality_state.v1`` states and the forward
outcome rows that will eventually grade them.  It is pure logic: no CLI, no
file writes, no network.  ``scripts/build_seasonality_shadow_state.py`` owns
every byte that touches the disk.

Four properties are structural rather than commented-on:

* **The state cannot act.**  Every state is assembled through
  :func:`engine.seasonality.contracts.build_neuralweb_state`, whose authority
  ceiling is all-false — a state may explain and may flag attention, and may
  never rank, gate, size, originate, rewrite geometry, or boost confidence.
  Nothing here returns a score or an ordering, and the emitted map is keyed by
  symbols the *index* already covers, so it can never introduce a name.
* **The state expires.**  ``expires_at`` is ``available_at + 48h``; a consumer
  that reads a stale file is expected to drop the block rather than carry a
  dead calendar read forward.
* **Absent data fails open with a structured gap.**  A missing, unreadable, or
  shape-shifted entity artifact produces a ``{"symbol", "reason_code",
  "detail"}`` row, never an exception, and never a fabricated state.
* **The window convention is checked, not assumed.**  Two independent
  implementations of this spec have already disagreed by one day about what
  ``start_doy`` names, and the disagreement is invisible in the output — it
  just publishes a slightly wrong |t|.  The artifact states its own convention
  in ``calendar.window_convention``; a symbol whose artifact no longer states
  the convention this module implements is a structured gap, not a guess.

The forward-ledger helpers at the bottom are pure too: they take rows in and
return rows out.  Appending them is the NIGHTLY's job alone (house law: the
nightly is the sole advancer of forward ledgers).

    EQUIVALENCE (why this reproduces the panel rather than approximating it):

    nothing and the on-or-before close is exactly right; Feb-29's return is
