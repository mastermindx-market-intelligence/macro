"""Program watch — the four things that can move biopharma seasonality forward.

The operator should not have to poll a session to learn whether the program
moved.  Four independent things can move it, each with a DIFFERENT next action,
and each one is READ FROM REAL STATE here rather than restated as a reminder:

1. ``biocatalyst_event_contract`` — the sister session's producer contract
   landing is what unblocks :mod:`engine.seasonality.event_clock`, which today
   refuses every payload wholesale because its expectation is unratified.
2. ``first_matured_grade`` — the forward ledger's first grade is the first
   evidence the calendar clock has any forward edge at all.
3. ``catalyst_render`` — the catalyst UI reaching the built page.
4. ``deferred_followups`` — three small deferrals that rot quietly.

Three design constraints, all load-bearing:

* **No wall clock.**  ``asof`` is always an explicit argument.  A watch that
  reads ``date.today()`` produces a different answer on a re-run of the same
  night, which makes the artifact untestable and the builder non-idempotent.
  ``tests/test_seasonality_program_watch.py`` greps this module for
  ``datetime.now`` / ``date.today`` and fails on either.
* **Pure stdlib.**  This runs beside thin-runner code in the same package (see
  the package docstring): no ``yaml``, no ``pandas``.  The one YAML-ish read
  here — the synapse notes block — is done as a scoped text scan for exactly
  that reason.
* **``unavailable`` is a real state.**  When an input is missing or unreadable
  the tripwire says so.  Reporting ``waiting`` for something that could not be
  checked is the failure mode this exists to prevent: it looks identical to a
  checked-and-not-yet answer, and the operator would wait on it forever.

Nothing in this module is user-facing.  Everything it emits — the operator
prompts, the doc paths, the module names — is PRIVATE-CHANNEL content and must
never reach a ``site/`` page.

#: and NONE carries the token ``seasonality``; a landing named
#: ``biocatalyst_event_projection.v1.schema.json`` would be missed by the tokens
#: and the watch would stay green-that-never-turns.  So the CONTENT is matched
#: too, on the contract id the reader is already pinned to
#: (``engine/seasonality/event_clock.EXPECTED_PROJECTION_CONTRACT``).  Kept as a
