"""Lane 1 — the point-in-time year panel behind the calendar clock.

One instrument's adjusted daily closes become a fixed 365-slot calendar-day
clock, one row per **complete** year.  Everything downstream (canonical curve,
window scanner, selection correction) reads this panel and nothing else, so the
honesty boundary lives here:

* the unit of evidence is one complete year, never one trading day;
* a year enters the panel only if the vendor actually covers it end to end;
* non-trading days carry a zero log return rather than an interpolated one;
* Feb-29's log return is folded into the Feb-28 slot so every year has the same
  365 slots and no year silently loses a session;
* the market-neutral variant subtracts a strictly trailing beta, so no residual
  ever sees a price that had not printed yet.

The vendor's adjustment is its **current vintage** re-applied to all history.
That is not a frozen point-in-time adjustment and the artifact says so
(``is_pit_adjustment: false``); this module cannot repair it, only disclose it.

Pure computation over the committed parquet store — no network.
