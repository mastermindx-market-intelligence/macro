"""Public, claim-bounded methodology manifest for the seasonality program.

The manifest exists to stop the program from quietly outgrowing its own claims.
Every field here is either a description of something that RUNS tonight or an
explicit ``False`` saying it does not.  Nothing is aspirational: the planned
clocks below sit under ``clocks``, which is a design vocabulary, while
``availability`` is the boolean record of what is actually commissioned.
