"""Risk Radar — forward-outcome log + deterministic grading (Phase B).

Every daily risk_radar snapshot is APPENDED to data/risk_radar/forward_log.jsonl (idempotent
by as-of date; every writer self-gates on ledger_lane_armed(), so off-lane renders are
read-only). Once an entry's horizon matures, it is GRADED deterministically against the
realized SPY path: did a >= threshold drawdown actually occur within H business days? Each
alert is then a true-positive or a false-positive. The rolling scorecard (realized precision /
recall / false-positive rate per state-band and per scare-type and per horizon) is what the
dashboard surfaces and what the Opus self-correction loop (engine/risk_radar_review.py) reads
to rethink wrong calls and retune the calibration. Self-auditing by construction.

Pure-ish + never raises into the build.
