"""``security_state.v1`` — Market OS B1A pure, deterministic per-security compiler.

Scope (Chairman-dispatched B1A commission, 2026-08-24; refusal-first second
subject added 2026-09-04). This module compiles the public, display-only
``security_state.v1`` contract (schema:
``contracts/market_os/security_state.v1.schema.json``) for the producer's
frozen AAPL/MSFT allowlist over a plain-dict/plain-row input surface. It is
deliberately **subject-scoped**, not a general identity resolver: a caller must
provide an immutable subject composed through the existing identity owners.

ZERO I/O, ZERO WALL-CLOCK. Every input this module reads is injected by the
caller (the producer stage, ``scripts/build_stock_library.py``) as a plain
dict/row/string — no parquet read, no HTTP fetch, no reading the live system
clock and no contract-file read. The producer loads the canonical
``security_state.v1`` schema once, prepares the Evidence Foundation K1 receipt
at its I/O boundary, and injects both in memory. The compiler independently
checks every subject-bearing K1 identity before using that receipt.

Public entry points:

* :func:`compile_security_state` — the compiler. Never raises for an EXPECTED
  degradation (identity refusal, an unpublished/unfetchable workspace, a
  rights-blocked K1 reference, conflicting K1 observations, ...): every one of
  those is a typed ``coverage_state`` in the output, per the "no null-means-
  neutral" law. It raises :class:`SecurityStateCompilationError` only for a
  genuinely malformed input a producer bug would produce.
* :func:`compile_security_state_failure` — a second pure builder the PRODUCER
  calls from its own exception-containment boundary when
  :func:`compile_security_state` itself raised. Never touches disk; the
  producer is the one that reads the subject's prior
  ``site/stockdata/<ticker>.json`` and passes that full prior state for
  subject-bound ``last_good`` derivation.

Identity receipt chain (R1-R9) — adjudicated 2026-08-24, re-derived here
exactly, never redesigned. See the docstring on :func:`_run_identity_chain`.
