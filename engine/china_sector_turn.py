"""Sector washout→turn context for the A-share stock screener board.

The consolidated screener (china_stocks.html "one board, two validated lenses") surfaces
the deepest within-sector dips (the validated reversal edge). This module adds the
OWNER-REQUESTED sector context: a name gets a DISPLAY boost when its sector washed out
along with it and the *sector* is now turning, via either leg:

  leg A (sector turn)   the equal-weight sector composite has washed out AND just fired
                        the validated 2D-MACD x 3D-StochRSI confluence turn — graded by
                        engine.confluence_tiers.cascade on the composite (T2 = the 2D
                        RSI-MACD just crossed with the 3D StochRSI recently crossed;
                        T3 = the same cross projected within ~1-2 days). T4 is excluded
                        (it fires off the 2D stoch, not the 3D — signal_gate.BUYABLE_TIERS).
  leg B (peers basing)  a broad share of the sector's WASHED-OUT peers have finished
                        going down: their smoothed downtrend velocity has collapsed to
                        ~flat (basing) or ticked slightly positive (perking). Velocity =
                        10-session change of the EMA-10 close; "washed" compares the same
                        velocity one month earlier.

Evidence framing (reports/china-reversal-gated.md, #754): conditioning the reversal book
on sector state as a FILTER was falsified (flat beats every gate, net, in every era) —
but washed-out sectors carry a marginally HIGHER per-name reversal IC (0.055-0.066 vs
0.041-0.047), i.e. the information is a small per-name TILT. This module therefore only
RE-ORDERS the default board view and highlights rows; it never adds or removes names,
and it feeds nothing downstream (no conviction, no auto-trade).

Best-effort throughout: bad/short data degrades to {} — a missing leg is absent, never
read as neutral.
