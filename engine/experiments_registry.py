"""engine/experiments_registry.py — the running-experiments manifest.

Emits site/marketdata/experiments.json: EVERY accruing forward-validation track-record,
calibration accrual, PIT / vintage accrual, parked-research trigger, and long-horizon
data-collection pipeline in the codebase — each with a STATUS and a concrete COME-BACK
date, so the admin console (admin/experiments.py) tells the owner exactly when to return
for each experiment's next step (and alerts when results are ready).

Two layers:
  • SEED (data/experiments/registry_seed.json): curated metadata for every tracked
    experiment — name, kind, source, what it measures, maturation criteria, next-step,
    priority, and a come-back date. Grounded once by an exhaustive codebase audit; edit
    the seed to add / retire an experiment. This is the source of truth for WHAT is tracked.
  • DYNAMIC overlay: for every experiment with a machine-readable reader (snapshot jsonl +
    *_track_record.json, desk ledgers, the radar IC grade, the calibration summary, a firing
    log, a parquet accrual), read the REAL current state each build and refresh status /
    state / ready. Everything degrades safely to the seed values.

An entry whose `hook` names no reader in _HOOKS keeps its hand-authored seed `state` FOREVER.
That is legitimate — plenty of entries have nothing machine-readable to read — but it must be
labelled: every record carries `state_live` (did a reader produce this line?) and `state_as_of`
(the artifact's date, or the seed audit date), and the panel prints the seed ones as "as of
<date> (seed)". Without that cue radar-ic advertised "n_matured=0, ic_all=null" for a month
after its read matured to n=2,456 / IC=-0.29.

DISPLAY-ONLY operational metadata; never sizes anything. Additive, never fatal.
