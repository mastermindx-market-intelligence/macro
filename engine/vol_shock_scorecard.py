"""Vol-Shock Risk Predictor — a forward 0-100 caution gauge that FUSES the
fast / LEADING precursors that tend to flash before an equity volatility shock,
with a transparent per-factor contribution breakdown (the "why").

WHY this exists: the repo's two existing 0-100 scores are deliberately SLOW —
engine.equity_alloc.risk_score (the S&P-Vector de-risk model) and the MRS
(engine.conditions.macro_risk_score) are both built from recession / NFCI /
liquidity / HY-OAS macro legs and LAG a days-ahead vol shock. The leading
precursors (cross-asset concentration, dealer short-gamma, a VIX term inversion,
a compressed variance-risk-premium, complacent positioning, an active
turning-point caution) are all ALREADY computed elsewhere but scattered and never
co-fused. This module is that fusion — and ONLY that fusion: a pure re-reading of
already-published dicts, never a new data fetch.

DISCIPLINE — honest by construction (mirrors engine/sector_bottom.py,
engine/turning_point.py, engine/event_risk.py):
  • DISPLAY-ONLY / VALIDATION-ACCRUING. It is a forward RISK / caution gauge, NOT
    an alpha signal. Nothing scored reads it; it feeds no allocation.
  • Renormalized weighted mean over AVAILABLE factors only (a missing factor drops
    out of BOTH numerator and denominator — engine.conditions._combine_legs /
    engine.equity_alloc.risk_legs precedent), with per-factor `points` that SUM to
    the headline so a stacked bar reconstructs the score (no black box).
  • Thin / young inputs are visibly flagged and down-weighted (put/call n<60).
  • turning_point is a CAPPED conditioning flag — it honors its own never-scored
    doctrine and can never dominate the gauge.
  • A FORWARD OUTCOME LOG (append/resolve/track_record, copied from
    engine.event_risk) accrues each firing against a PRE-REGISTERED outcome
    (realized SPY drawdown over N days OR a VIX intraday-high jump) so the gauge
    can be GRADED on forward data before it is ever allowed to govern anything.
    The band edges + the outcome label are pre-registered HERE, not tuned post-hoc.

Pure function of the stored dicts — no recompute, deterministic, unit-testable,
and wrapped so it NEVER raises into the build (degrade-never-raise house rule).
