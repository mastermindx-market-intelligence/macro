"""Estimator implication output contract v1 — a read-only composer.

This module is a **read-only composer**: it edits neither
``engine/synthetic_control.py`` nor ``engine/seasonality/event_study.py``, only
reads their frozen result artifacts and copies selected values verbatim.

It is **measurement-tier only**. The emitted payload carries a point estimate,
its uncertainty, honest sample/episode counts, and diagnostics — and nothing
else. There is no rank, gate, size, direction-confidence, or expected-impact
field anywhere in the schema; adding one would be an unauthorized K5-class
promotion this module has no authority to make.

Nulls are **printed with plain-word reasons**, in English and Chinese, never
fabricated or silently dropped. An unregistered search family is refused
outright (``UnregisteredSearchFamily``) rather than served as a weak or
"pending" result.

The composer is **deterministic**: no wall clock, no network, no randomness.
The payload id is a content-bound digest, so mutating the underlying artifact
changes the id.

This is a **strict named profile** of ``mastermind.research_implication_card/v1``
(#6830, ``engine/research_implication_card.py``) — not the same schema. It
reuses #6830's key names and semantics verbatim wherever a field is shared
(the five ``authority`` keys, the six ``quality`` states, the
``null_reasons``/``limitations``/``diagnostics`` key spellings, the
``code/label/value/unit/source`` metric shape, the
``code/label/passed/detail/source`` diagnostic shape, and the ``{en, zh}``
localized shape). It differs deliberately: ``schema`` is its own const (a
profile, not a card); the id namespace is ``eimp_`` rather than ``ric_`` so
the two id spaces can never collide; ``adapter_version`` becomes
``composer_version`` because this module composes rather than adapts; and it
adds ``registered_family`` + ``honest_n`` blocks that #6830's card does not
require. See the PR body for the full reconciliation note.
