"""Unified per-stock **view model** — the single render contract for all 5 markets.

``build_view(rec, market)`` is a THIN, PURE projection over the already-assembled
per-ticker record (US ``site/stockdata/<T>.json`` and the ex-US equivalents). It does
**not** compute any new signal — it reads ``rec["conviction"]`` (the canonical verdict
spine from :mod:`engine.stock_score`) plus the other panels already on ``rec`` and
reshapes them into ONE declarative model the shared ``site/stockview.js`` renders.

Why this exists (research: ``optimized-yawning-wand.md`` §2/§7): the five analyzer
pages each cloned the verdict/conviction renderer and drifted. Routing every page
through one model emitted here makes drift structurally impossible (the layout is a
projection of this dict's field order) and makes the page unable to contradict the
engine. Per-market truth (CN mean-reversion, HK no-alpha, valuation neutrality) flows
through as DATA — labels come from the record, never from template strings.

Contract:
* Output rides **additively** as ``rec["view"]`` — old templates ignore it.
* Every user-facing string carries an ``_zh`` sibling (bilingual, baked at build).
* Everything is present-gated: a missing leg is simply absent, never rendered as a
  neutral placeholder. Degrades to the always-present cycle/ladder spine on a
  close-only record with no conviction block.
* The ONE headline verb is ``conviction.verdict`` — every dissenting read becomes a
  ``falsifier`` (a "what would flip this"), never a second competing verb.
* The Conflict/Neutral state and the per-verdict gloss are computed HERE (engine side)
  and shipped as data, so ``stockview.js`` never re-derives a second opinion.
