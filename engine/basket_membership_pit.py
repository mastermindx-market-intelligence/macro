"""Point-in-time (PIT) membership history for the two CN basket suites.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
``research/CHINA_PROPHET_LOSER_INTELLIGENCE_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md`` §2.12 names
this the **weakest joint** of the whole relay program: the THS concept-board
membership used by the 12-month ignition/chase study was a single 2026-07-08
snapshot applied BACKWARD over the entire window, and the two PIT snapshots that
do exist differ by 7.7% of member-slots across 8 days.  Any theme/relay
construction measured on back-applied membership is look-ahead-contaminated, so
§5 W-C charters this store as the prerequisite for ANY future relay-construction
promotion.  It ships display/infrastructure tier and grades nothing.

WHAT IT IS
----------
An append-only parquet per suite — ``data/<suite>/membership_history.parquet`` —
with one row per ``(snapshot_date, basket_id, ticker)``, keep-FIRST on that key
so a re-run on the same day can never duplicate or rewrite a stamped day.  The
curated suite (``baskets_china``) is snapshotted the same way as the machine
suite (``baskets_china_ths``): same columns, same semantics, so a consumer needs
one reader, not two.

CONTENT DEDUP (why every calendar day is not a row set)
------------------------------------------------------
A full THS snapshot is ~3,500 member rows.  Stamping one every night would add
~1.3M rows/year that say nothing — membership moves on the vendor's schedule,
not the trading calendar.  So a snapshot_date is stamped only when the
membership set DIFFERS from the newest one already stored (``members_sha`` over
the normalized ``(basket_id, ticker, added, removed)`` tuples, so a cosmetic
re-serialization of membership.json is not mistaken for a membership change).
This is the same content-dedup the sibling JSON side-car in
``scripts/build_baskets_china_ths.py`` already uses, and it leaves the PIT read
identical: **the membership in force at date D is the newest snapshot ≤ D.**

LANE DISCIPLINE
---------------
House law (CLAUDE.md): nightly/asia is the sole advancer of ledgers; render
lanes discard ``data/`` writes.  Every writer here goes through ``_lane_ok``,
which is FAIL-CLOSED and PER-SUITE: each suite names the ONE collection lane
allowed to advance it (``SUITE_LANE``) and everything else — a foreign lane, an
unrecognised lane, an unknown suite, or no lane at all — is refused before any
write.  It does NOT mirror ``engine.china_standout_track.append_board``'s
permissive ``lane is not None`` form; see ``_lane_ok`` for why keep-FIRST makes
that default unsafe here.

THREE SUITES, TWO LANES (GMI W1a)
---------------------------------
The two CN suites are advanced by the asia collection lane (asia-close.yml,
``CN_LANE=asia``).  The US suite ``baskets`` — the 49 hand-curated US thematic
baskets in ``data/baskets/membership.json`` — is advanced by the US nightly
(daily.yml, ``COLLECT_LANE=nightly``), which is the only lane that collects and
commits US ``data/``.  The gate is per-suite precisely because "asia" is the
wrong answer for a US store and "nightly" is the wrong answer for a CN one: a
single global lane name would have to be permissive enough to admit both, and
this store cannot afford a permissive gate (keep-FIRST, below).  US rows carry
the same COLUMNS; ``name_zh`` is simply empty for them — one reader, not two.

TWO SIDE-CAR SHAPES (and why the store says which one it used)
--------------------------------------------------------------
The dated JSON side-cars are not uniform.  ``2026-06-30.json`` predates the
byte-copy the seeder writes today: it is the RAW vendor concept dump keyed by
the Chinese board name, ~9,069 member-slots.  ``2026-07-08.json`` is a
membership.json copy — the SEEDED, capped subset the engine actually tracks,
~3,532 slots.  Both are true about their own population; they are not the same
population.  Differencing naively across that boundary reports ~61% "drift",
which is mostly the seeding cap.  So every row records ``source_shape`` and
``members_asof`` returns it with an explicit note when the resolved snapshot's
shape is not the store's newest.  The alternative — dropping the older file —
would delete half of the only real PIT evidence the program has.

THE READER'S CONTRACT (the load-bearing half)
---------------------------------------------
``members_asof`` ALWAYS reports which basis it answered on.  When the history
predates the requested date — the store's birth is forward-only, so every date
before its first snapshot is uncovered — it falls back to the CURRENT
membership.json and stamps ``pit=False``.  A consumer that silently treats a
fallback answer as point-in-time is exactly the look-ahead bug this store was
built to end, so the flag is not optional metadata: it is the answer.  The same
goes for ``source_shape``: a caveat that does not travel with the answer is a
caveat nobody reads.

    WHY A SEPARATE STAMP.  Both snapshot writers are content-deduped: when

    correct for the history and catastrophic for monitoring, because a writer that
    is deduping and a writer that has been UNWIRED FOR A MONTH leave the identical

    two snapshots while its nightly step ran green ~35 nights in a row: the step
    hashed today's membership.json against the last side-car, matched, and skipped,
    every night, because nothing upstream was refreshing membership.json at all.

    So liveness gets its own artifact.  It is MUTABLE (rewritten every run) and
    therefore explicitly NOT part of the append-only history: it records the last
    time the writer ran, never what membership was on some past date.  It lives
    inside the snapshots dir so a reader needs one path, and is named with a
    leading ``_`` so it can never collide with — or be globbed as — a dated
    side-car (``dated_snapshots`` is the one enumerator, and it is date-shaped).

    ``membership_sha`` is the writer's own dedup basis (sha256 of the membership
    document it just hashed), so a stale ``last_snapshot_date`` next to a moving
    ``membership_sha`` says "membership is churning but nothing is being stamped",

    ``pit`` is the contract.  ``True`` means the answer came from a stored
    snapshot dated ≤ ``date`` (point-in-time, safe to measure on).  ``False``
    means the store does not cover ``date`` — the history is forward-only from
    its birth — and the answer is the CURRENT membership applied backward, which

    is a decision, never an accident.

    ``source_shape`` is the SECOND basis, and it matters for the same reason.
    The earliest side-car is the raw vendor concept dump (every name on the
    board); every later one is the seeded membership (the capped subset the
    engine actually tracks).  Both are true about their own population, but they
    are not the same population, so differencing across the boundary measures
    the seeding cap as well as real membership churn.  ``note`` says so
