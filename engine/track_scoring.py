"""Honest episode scoring shared by the four Track-record desks (US / CN / HK / CA).

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
----------------------
Before 2026-07-26 each desk scored its own board with its own conventions, and the
US desk's conventions were wrong in three ways that all pushed the headline UP:

  * entry was the close on the board's OWN as_of date — the bar the board is computed
    from, published that evening. Unbuyable. Worth +5.5pp of win rate and 69% of the
    reported average return.
  * "exit" was the latest close available today, so a pick's holding period was
    however many days happened to have elapsed since it surfaced — 1 to 17 sessions,
    pooled into one win rate.
  * a ticker's episode was anchored to its FIRST-EVER appearance, so a name that ran,
    left the board, and came back was still marked from the original date and sat in
    `onboard` (outside the win rate) forever.

THE THREE RULES THAT MAKE THE NUMBER HONEST
-------------------------------------------
1. **FORCED VERDICT AT MATURITY.** Every scored episode is resolved at exactly
   ``horizon`` forward sessions. A rule-based early exit (oscillator overbought, stop
   break) may fire EARLY; it may NEVER extend the horizon.

   This is not a stylistic choice — it is the whole design. The tempting alternative
   ("resolve when the thesis resolves: overbought = win, stop = loss, else still in
   flight") was measured on 2026-07-26 and reported 83.6% win / 5.05 profit factor.
   It was an artefact. The overbought leg fires WHEN PRICE RALLIES, so winners
   self-resolve in days while losers drift and sit unresolved forever. Measured on
   the US board: resolved episodes carried a +1.66% mean mark with 30% under water,
   unresolved ones −1.14% with 61% under water — a 2.8pp hole exactly where the
   losers went. The tell was that raising the overbought threshold 70→85 IMPROVED the
   win rate 76.8→85.5% while pushing 37%→62% of episodes into "in flight". A real
   edge does not improve when you count less of it.

   Any denominator conditioned on HOW a trade ended will do this. Resolve on time, or
   do not resolve at all.

2. **SYMMETRIC MATURITY GATE.** An episode is scored only once ``horizon`` forward
   bars EXIST for it. Younger episodes are counted and disclosed as in-flight, never
   silently dropped and never force-marked at a partial horizon. Exclusion by age is
   symmetric (it cannot know which way the trade went); exclusion by outcome is not.

3. **DATE-BLOCKED CONFIDENCE INTERVALS.** Episodes surfaced on the same board night
   are one bet, not N. Wilson-on-raw-n treats them as independent and reports an
   interval several times too narrow. ``date_block_ci`` resamples whole board days.
   ``n_board_days`` is emitted next to ``n_matured`` so the reader sees the effective
   sample, not the row count.

WHAT MAY DIFFER PER DESK (parameters, never structure)
------------------------------------------------------
  benchmark (SPY / CSI300 / HSI / TSX) · fill legality (A-share locked-limit days are
  unfillable) · headline metric (absolute P&L for US, benchmark excess for CN where
  beta dominates) · whether a rule-based early exit is enabled at all (CN runs
  fixed-horizon until the oscillator thresholds are refit for A-share volatility).

Grain, forced verdict, maturity gate, denominator, and CI method are IDENTICAL across
desks — two methodologies would mean two audit surfaces and no comparability.
