"""CHINA INTELLIGENCE INTEREST — the BOARD-INDEPENDENT interest composite (v4 R1).

The China Prophet v4 board ranks by INTERESTINGNESS and gates by ENTRY.  This
module owns the first half: a deterministic ``intel_interest_score`` in ``[0, 100]``
built from China Intelligence's *upstream evidence* only.  It owns no admission
decision, no lane, and no display shelf — :mod:`engine.china_board_rank` remains the
sole live ranking authority and decides what, if anything, this evidence does to the
board.

WHY A SEPARATE SCORER RATHER THAN THE HUB'S ``opportunity_score``
----------------------------------------------------------------
:mod:`engine.china_intel_hub` fuses five desks, and one of those desks IS the Prophet
board (``site/factordata/china_standouts.json``).  Its ``opportunity_score`` therefore
carries the board's own output back into itself through four separate terms.  Ranking
the board by that number would close a feedback loop: names would rank highly partly
because they already rank highly.  This module re-derives the composite from the same
upstream evidence with every board-derived term STRUCTURALLY ABSENT — not zeroed, not
down-weighted, but never computed and never available to compute:

  * ``board_row`` direction (hub ``_dirs``: board membership read as a bullish desk)
  * board label → edge fraction (hub ``_edge_remaining``: the ``_LABEL_EDGE`` leg)
  * the board-ABSENT bonus (hub ``_edge_remaining``: ``0.75`` for "crowd hasn't found it")
  * board direction inside the leading-vs-lagging gap (hub ``_leading_gap``: ``lag_up``)
  * any Prophet score or rank, in any leg, at any weight

See :data:`BOARD_DERIVED_TERMS_EXCLUDED`.  ``tests/test_china_intel_interest.py`` pins
the fence structurally: this module never reads the board artifact and never reads the
hub's own command artifact.

WHAT REMAINS (upstream evidence, not Prophet's own output)
----------------------------------------------------------
signal core (altdata convergence/conviction, else radar strength) · price trajectory
(off-high room, RS vs CSI300, 20d extension) · special-situation overhang penalties ·
altdata crowding penalty · falsifier penalty · leading-desk information.  The
composite keeps the hub's INTELLIGENCE_HUB_V2 shape so the two numbers stay readable
against each other:

    interest = 100 × signal_core × falsifier_penalty × edge_remaining × gap_mult

CONTEXT TIER.  This is a display/ordering-tier composite: it orders names that the
v3 entry machinery has ALREADY admitted, and it can neither admit a name nor veto one.
It has accrued no forward record of its own and claims none; promotion to any
gate/size authority is a separate pre-registered question.

NULLS ARE NOT ZEROS.  A name the desks have never seen has no interest score — it is
returned as ``basis="unavailable"`` with ``score=None``, and the board falls back to
its v3 priority under an explicit ``intel_interest_basis="fallback_v3"`` stamp.
Fabricating a zero would sink every uncovered name beneath every covered one on
evidence that was never gathered.
