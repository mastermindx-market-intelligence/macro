"""Asof-aware Tushare-vs-free-fallback preference + a consume-time staleness badge.

THE BUG (masterplan §W6-CN fix 4): the gated Tushare drip plane (``data/tushare/*.parquet``)
was PREFERRED over fresh free fallbacks on FILE PRESENCE ALONE — never asof. When the
Tushare token drops out of the collection environment the client no-ops silently
(``collectors/tushare_client.query`` returns None with no token), so the last committed
Tushare parquet freezes in place. Consumers kept reading that frozen plane in preference
to the free siblings that were updating daily — inverted source preference: STALE gated
beats FRESH free. (Live 2026-07-01: all ``data/tushare/*`` stuck at 2026-06-18/06-21 while
``china_a_val`` etc. read 2026-06-30/07-01.)

THE FIX: prefer Tushare only when its data-through date is within ``max_lag_sessions`` of
the free source's — otherwise fall back to the fresh free plane. Also exposes the Tushare
plane's data-through date so run_status/health can register it and surfaces can render a
staleness badge.

Pure/best-effort: any parse issue degrades to "unknown asof" which, being conservative,
DE-prefers Tushare (fresh free wins) rather than silently trusting a stale gated file.
