"""Alert Command Center time contract — three clocks, one board day.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The Alert Center is a triage layer: its ranking, its "today / 1d ago" wording, its
recency points and its catalyst countdown all decide what a PM looks at FIRST.  Until
this module existed those all derived from ``datetime.now(timezone.utc).date()`` and
from whatever ``ts`` an engine happened to serialize — which let two different clocks
collapse into one and made a build-time stamp masquerade as an event time.  The two
measured regressions:

  * ``engine.subsector_rotation_alerts`` stamped its events with the rotation payload's
    ``generated_utc`` (the moment our builder ran) instead of its ``asof`` (the settled
    session the read is about), so conclusions drawn from the Aug-19 tape displayed as
    "2026-08-20 · today";
  * the board's own "today" was UTC midnight, so between 00:00Z and 05:00Z (a window the
    nightly pipeline runs straight through) a US cross-asset desk rolled its day over
    while New York was still in the previous afternoon.

THREE CLOCKS, NEVER INTERCHANGEABLE
-----------------------------------
  1. ``event_date`` / ``event_ts``  — when the thing actually happened.
  2. ``source_asof``                — the market/data observation it was derived from.
  3. ``recorded_at``                — when Mastermind processed / serialized it.

``recorded_at`` is never promoted to ``event_*`` merely because it is easier to obtain.

BOARD DAY
---------
The Alert Center is a US cross-asset desk, so its user-facing "today" / "yesterday" and
its catalyst countdown project onto ``America/New_York`` — NOT UTC, and NOT the host's
naive local clock.  Storage stays source-native: date/session events keep their own event
date and absolute events keep their offset-aware instant; only the *projection* is ET.

PRECISION
---------
  ``date``       a market-session event ("rotation observed from the 2026-08-19 close").
                 It has no clock time and never gains a fabricated one — an Aug-19 session
                 event is Aug-19 on the board, not ``2026-08-19T00:00 ET``.
  ``timestamp``  a real instant (crypto / intraday).  It stays offset-aware internally and
                 projects to a board day for labelling: ``2026-08-20T00:30Z`` is still that
                 instant, and it is an Aug-19 event for this desk.
  ``unknown``    no usable event time.  Earns NO recency credit and is never called "today";
                 the caller discloses the unknown date rather than inventing one.

NOTE on legacy naive stamps: every jsonl alert engine in this repo serializes a session
date as ``YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00`` (no offset).  That midnight is a serialization artifact of
a date, not a claim about a clock time, so it is read back as ``date`` precision — the same
reading ``engine.alert_triage`` already applied via its ``ts.hour == 0 and ts.minute == 0``
heuristic.  A producer that genuinely means midnight-as-an-instant says so explicitly with
``date_precision`` / an offset-aware ``event_ts``.

Deterministic and injectable: every entry point takes ``now`` so nothing here is tested
against a wall clock.
