"""Resolve one observed event to ``event_id → document_revision → span``, or to
a typed absence.

This is the v2 projection contract-freeze Q3 calls for: the event-level
``claim_citations_pending`` boolean becomes DERIVED
(``pending == any(claim has no receipt)``) instead of a stored assertion.  v1 is
untouched — ``contracts.validate_context`` still raises unless the stored flag
is exactly ``True``, and it must keep doing so.

The resolution order is the safety order, and it is deliberate:

1. **Availability firewall.**  A record stamped after the clock that read it is
   quarantined and never published, even when it carries a perfect receipt.
2. **Supersession collapse.**  A duplicate re-delivery resolves to the event the
   original already minted; it never mints a second one.  A collapse must be
   EARNED from the revision chain — there is deliberately no way for a producer
   to assert one.  See "why no declared duplicate" below.
3. **Byte replay.**  A committed receipt is re-sliced against the body we hold.
   Drift raises rather than downgrades — a receipt that cannot be replayed is
   worthless, and silently demoting it to an absence would hide a corrupted
   store.
4. **Declared address.**  An exact PDF cell or slide region in a document whose
   bytes this estate does not hold: an address, explicitly not a receipt.
5. **Typed absence.**  The fall-through.

Because absence is the fall-through and a receipt can only be minted from bytes
that replay, this resolver cannot manufacture a citation: the failure direction
is always MORE absences, never more receipts.

WHY THERE IS NO DECLARED DUPLICATE
----------------------------------
``declared_locator`` is a producer ASSERTION this resolver honours, and that is
safe because of which way it fails: strip it and an ``exact_receipt`` degrades to
a ``typed_absence``.  It can only ever cost the estate evidence it never proved.

A *declared duplicate* fails the other way, and so it does not exist here.  The
collapse at step 2 sets ``mints_event=False``, and step 2 runs BEFORE the byte
replay at step 3 — deliberately, because a genuine re-delivery must not mint a
second event even when it carries a perfect receipt.  An assertion entering at
that step would therefore outrank proof: it would suppress an event from the
mint set, discard a replayable receipt, and leave nothing downstream able to
tell that it rested on nothing.  That is the one failure direction the paragraph
above claims this resolver does not have.

The field ``declared_duplicate_of`` and the basis ``declared_duplicate_filing``
existed until 2026-08-07 and were removed rather than tested.  Nothing in the
estate ever produced one: the sole use in the repo's history was
``tests/test_company_intelligence_spine_corpus.py`` feeding the resolver an
assertion to reproduce two golden-corpus cases (CIE-GC-0227, CIE-GC-0234) that
had been labelled ``duplicate_collapsed`` by a positional ``index % 7 == 6`` rule
with no observable duplication behind them.  Both were relabelled
``typed_absence`` in #4926, and the declared column has read 0 by design ever
since.

Duplicate detection is settled and it lives upstream, on evidence:
``engine.earnings_release.filing_key`` is "the one place that decides what 'the
same filing' means" on the frozen ``(cik, accession)`` key (contract freeze Q2),
and ``engine.earnings_release.binding.collapse_release_events`` earns every
collapse it reports from ``duplicate_filing_key``, ``identical_body_sha256``, or
``supersedes_without_amending``.  It resolves the corpus's fourteen
``duplicate_release`` cases without an assertion, exactly as the chain below
does.  If a future wave bridges those verdicts into this resolver, the basis it
carries is the earned reason it arrived with — never a "declared" one.
