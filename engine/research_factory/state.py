"""engine.research_factory.state — §4 state machine.

Enforces: allowed-pair matrix, actor-class allowlist, mandatory-field
presence, monotonic as_of, and the respin human-gate.

All logic is pure (no I/O except the one optional ledger existence check for
the 'screened' gate).  Callers do the I/O; this module just validates.

Note: the on-disk append-only discipline lives in ledger.py (RF-8).
