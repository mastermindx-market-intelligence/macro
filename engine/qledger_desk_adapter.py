"""engine/qledger_desk_adapter.py — desk thesis row -> Universal Scoreboard
PROSPECTIVE claim (Eval OS P3).

WHY THIS EXISTS. `engine/qledger.py` is the claims+grades substrate (the
Universal Scoreboard). Three desks already emit an engine-derived, falsifiable,
machine-checkable lean but were never registering it there:

    engine               store                             declared ruler
    engine/stock_desk.py     data/stock_desk/theses.jsonl       20 trading days
    engine/thematic_desk.py  data/thematic_desk/theses.jsonl    20 trading days
    engine/demand_ledger.py  data/demand_chain/theses.jsonl    126 trading days

This module is the TRANSLATOR + GATE between a desk's own ledger row and a
qledger claim. It is deliberately narrow:

  * DIRECTION IS NEVER INFERRED. Every desk here writes a REAL `lean` enum
    (constructive/neutral/cautious/avoid; overweight/underweight/avoid;
    outperform/underperform). Direction is a straight TABLE LOOKUP from that
    enum (`_LEAN_DIRECTION`) — never derived from a computed predicate, a
    price, or a script's own judgement (rule R4 / constitution A7 holds at
    this boundary). A lean absent from the table (stock_desk's `neutral`) is a
    declared NO-CALL and is SKIPPED, never filed as direction=0 — 71% of the
    existing qledger corpus is already direction==0/salience-only, and filing
    a desk's own explicit "I have no view" as a scored salience claim would
    grow that share with rows the desk itself refused to make a call on.

  * THE PRICEABLE LEG IS READ FROM THE ENGINE'S OWN FALSIFIER, NEVER THE
    DISPLAY LABEL. `scope_key`/`bench` are `falsifier.check.subject_ticker` /
    `.vs` — for thematic_desk that is the theme's resolved proxy ETF, never the
    unpriceable theme name. A row whose falsifier is `kind: "soft"` (no scalar
    proxy) carries no `subject_ticker` and is skipped for the same reason.

  * FORWARD-ONLY, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT (CEO P3 — "the absolute
    constraint"). A prior attempt (branch `claude/eval-os-t9-adoption`, never
    merged) registered stock_desk/thematic_desk rows whose `state_asof` was
    already 1-4 completed trading sessions stale by the time the row was
    written — so the very first bar of the graded window had ALREADY PRINTED
    at registration time, i.e. the "prediction" was partly a description of a
    known past. `_outcome_not_yet_determined` is the fix: it resolves the
    claim's own window through `qledger.claim_window` (the SAME resolver
    `grade_claim` uses — one clock, reused, never reinvented) and refuses any
    claim whose fill session is not STRICTLY AFTER the registration date. A
    claim that clears this gate has NO price bar anywhere in its graded window
    yet, by construction — the outcome cannot be even partially known.

  * NO `backfilled` FLAG. The prior attempt's `backfilled=True` provenance tag
    was a decorative no-op (nothing in qledger read it, so a family built
    entirely from after-the-fact imports cleared every promotion gate exactly
    like a live-forward one — blocker B3). The fix here is not a better flag:
    it is registering NOTHING that fails the forward gate above. A rejected
    (retrospective / no-call / region-excluded) row is counted and logged, it
    is never registered under a flag that asks a future reader to remember to
    check it.

  * ANCHOR-AT-REGISTRATION (stock_desk, thematic_desk only; Eval OS E1).
    Production receipts show these two families' desk rows always carry a
    `state_asof` that is a completed prior session — the desk logs its lean
    describing a session that already closed, and registration always runs on
    a later UTC date. Under the forward-only gate above, that state date is
    the claim's `asof`, `qledger.claim_window` resolves the fill session from
    it, and the fill is never strictly after the registration date: every row
    was refused `retrospective_at_registration`, forever, by construction —
    these two families have never registered a single qledger claim. The lean
    itself is still a genuinely FORWARD call: it is made AT registration time,
    about what happens next, from a state snapshot that is necessarily a
    little stale (the desk reasons from the last completed session's data).
    So `FamilyConfig.anchor_at_registration` anchors the claim's `asof` at the
    REGISTRATION date itself rather than the row's own state date — the
    graded window becomes fill = the next session strictly after today, which
    is provably forward under the SAME unchanged gate. The row's own state
    date is never discarded: it is preserved on the claim as
    `state_asof_source`, so the staleness of the snapshot that informed the
    call stays fully auditable. `demand_chain` keeps its unmodified crawl-date
    anchor — its family basis is already established and its evidence clock
    is already live; an accruing family is never re-anchored.

  * CALLERS PASS ONLY ROWS THEY JUST WROTE. Every call site
    (engine/stock_desk.py, engine/thematic_desk.py, engine/demand_ledger.py)
    hands this module the rows THIS run appended to its own ledger — never a
    re-read of the full committed history. A historical row already sitting in
    the store before this program existed is HISTORY; this module has no path
    that can turn it into a claim (there is no `include_backfill` switch here,
    unlike the prior attempt's adapter).

REGION SCOPE (thematic_desk only). Only `market == "us"` rows are translated.
canada/hk/china proxies have no price parquet in this repo, and the CN leg
additionally needs its own ruling against `DNR:KILL-CN-ADJUSTED-TAPE-LEGAL-
LIMIT` — both out of scope here; the census that identified the three P3
families explicitly carried this exclusion forward.

FAILURE IS LOUD AND COUNTED, NEVER SILENT. A source-collection failure
upstream of this module (the caller could not even read its own ledger) must
be told apart from "read fine, found nothing to register this run" — the first
is `source_error` (an explicit `::warning`), the second is an honest small (or
zero) `n_candidates`. A `register_batch` exception is caught, printed as a
GitHub `::error` annotation (bare `print(..., flush=True)` — never through a
logger; a prefixing log formatter would swallow the `::` prefix and the
Actions summary would show nothing, exactly the defect `tests/
test_gh_annotation_line_start.py` exists to catch), and returned in the stats
dict rather than propagated — accrual must never sink a desk's build.

    stored both `sector` (the resolved vocabulary value) and `control` (its own
    `control_for_sector` lookup), so no second implementation of the resolution
    can drift from the one that actually registered.

    `raw_sector_of` IS THE FIX FOR A COLLAPSED BUCKET (review round 2, F1). A
    NORMALISING resolver — `qledger.membership_gics_sector_of`, the C2.3
    construction — returns None for BOTH "this ticker is absent from
    membership.parquet" AND "this ticker's sector is a vocabulary the alias table
    cannot map". Both then reach here with an empty `claim["sector"]`, so every
    D0-2 mismatch was reported as `sector_absent` and the `::warning` carried no
    vocabulary sample at all: the one family this wiring serves could not report
    the refusal class the census demands ("normalise the alias set explicitly AND
    count what it refuses"). Measured before the fix, a store holding
    `{NVDA: "Technology", WEIRD: "Quantum Widgets", OFFIDX: absent}` reported
    `{'sector_absent': 2}` and named nothing.

    So when — and ONLY when — the claim carries no `sector`, the RAW resolver is

    can name it. Nothing else changes: `make_claim` never sees this resolver, the

    `rows` MUST be exactly the rows the caller's OWN ledger append just wrote
    this run — never a re-read of the full committed store (see module note).

    `source_error` — set this when the CALLER could not even collect its rows
    this run (e.g. an exception reading its own ledger). This is a DIFFERENT,
    LOUDER state than "collected fine, 0 rows to register": it short-circuits
    before any translation is attempted and emits its own `::warning`, so a
    "could not look" run is never confused with an honest zero.

    `sector_of` — the registration-time control construction (P0d C2.3):
    `subject ticker -> sector NAME`, which `translate_row` hands to
    `qledger.make_claim(sector=...)`, which resolves the sector ETF itself. The
    resolver must return a GICS sector NAME, never an ETF ticker (census D0-1 in
    reverse); `qledger.membership_gics_sector_of(root)` is the canonical one.
    Whatever it returns, EVERY candidate's control outcome is counted into
    `n_control_valid` / `n_control_missing` / `control_refusals` (C2.4), and a
    `matched_control_required` family with any missing control emits one
    `::warning` naming the split and the offending vocabulary values — silence is
    how a dead control wiring survives four months.

    `raw_sector_of` — TELEMETRY ONLY, never used to build a claim: the
    UN-normalised `ticker -> raw sector value` read (for demand_chain,
    `qledger.sector_of_ticker`). It is consulted only for a candidate whose
    `sector` came back empty, to tell "the universe file has no row for this
    ticker" (`sector_absent`) from "the file HAD a value and the alias table
    could not map it" (`vocabulary_unmapped`) — a distinction a normalising
    `sector_of` structurally cannot report, and the one census D0-2 exists to
    make countable. Omitting it is safe and keeps the previous behaviour; the
    cost is that every such refusal reads as `sector_absent`.

    `dry_run=True` runs the EXACT same translate/gate/register_batch path
    against a throwaway temporary store (never the real `root`) so the
    reported accept/reject counts are the real registrar's own verdict, not a
    re-implementation of its rules. The temporary store is discarded when this
    call returns; nothing under `root` is touched.

    ANCHOR-AT-REGISTRATION (`fam_cfg.anchor_at_registration` — see module
    docstring). For stock_desk/thematic_desk, `translate_row` is called with
    `asof_override=today.isoformat()`: the desk's lean is a forward call made
    AT registration time, so anchoring the claim's `asof` at the registration
    date (rather than the row's always-completed `state_asof`) makes the
    graded window provably forward — fill = the next session strictly after
    today — under the SAME unchanged forward-only gate. Nothing about the gate
    itself, or about `demand_chain` (which keeps its live crawl-date anchor;
    its family basis is already established and an accruing family is never
    re-anchored), changes.

    Never raises. A `register_batch` failure is caught, printed as a GitHub
    `::error` annotation, and returned in `stats["error"]` — the caller's
    build must not die over an accrual step (matches every sibling desk's
    "additive, never fatal" contract), but the failure is no longer silent
    (the prior attempt's blocker: "a total registration failure was silent
    and, for stock_desk, permanent").
