"""Point-in-time (PIT) truth-layer accessor — audit #5 #14 #16 #39, masterplan W1a.

The live feature frame (engine/inputs.py) stamps every FRED series on its native
*reference* index (the month/week the data describes) and forward-fills. For monthly
econ prints that publish weeks later, this bakes a look-ahead into every historical
row: the growth/inflation axes "know" a payrolls or CPI print on the 1st of the month
when it was not published until ~the first Friday of the *next* month (#5, timing
leak), and they read the *latest-revised* value rather than the number that was on the
screen at the time (#14, revision leak).

This module is the SHADOW accessor that produces a leak-free frame. It never touches
the live path. `series(name, as_of, basis)` returns a daily business-day series a
real-money backtest can trust as genuinely as-of:

  basis='reference'  -> current live behaviour: native reference stamping, ffill.
                        Byte-identical to inputs.put() for the same series. The
                        control leg for the leakage-tax diff.
  basis='latest'     -> latest-revised finals, reference-stamped, ffill. (Same
                        numbers as 'reference' for the local store — the store only
                        keeps revised finals — but the accessor keeps the axis
                        distinct so a future revised-vs-initial study can split them.)
  basis='release'    -> the LEAK-FREE frame. For each historical business day d it
                        carries the value that was actually AVAILABLE on d:
                          * vintaged series (ALFRED matrix): the latest vintage whose
                            realtime_start <= d (initial release, revision-free), via
                            an as-of join on realtime_start. A period is never visible
                            before it was first published.
                          * non-vintaged series: the reference-stamped value shifted
                            forward to its MODELLED release date (static schedule
                            priors in config `pit.release_lags`, documented per series;
                            learned lags accrue via engine.pit_lag_recorder).

Design invariants (see tests/test_pit_accessor.py):
  * A value is NEVER visible on the release frame before its realtime_start (vintaged)
    or its modelled release date (non-vintaged). This is the whole point.
  * The 'reference' basis reproduces inputs.put() exactly (backward-compat control).
  * No fork of the axis math: engine.inputs.build_features(pit_basis=..., pit_as_of=...)
    routes the *same* put() through this accessor, so axes/regime run unchanged.
