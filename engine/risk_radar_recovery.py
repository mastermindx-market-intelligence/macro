"""Risk Radar DE-ESCALATION — the "risk has peaked / the risk-off may be ending" read.

DISPLAY-ONLY · LEAF · NEVER RAISES. The mirror image of the rising-risk radar. It surfaces
ONLY after the radar has been genuinely hot, when two things line up:

  (a) RISK DERATING — the radar's own intensity has peaked and the pullback odds are rolling
      over (engine/risk_radar.trajectory; leak-free, from the same causal sub-score history); and
  (b) a LIQUIDITY TURN — the macro money tide is turning supportive: Fed net liquidity expanding
      (TGA drawdown / reserves rising), the Fed pricing or signalling cuts (incl. an emergency
      cut), the PBoC easing (RRR / LPR), or the global central-bank balance-sheet tide
      (Fed + ECB + BoJ) expanding.

When risk DERATES while liquidity is INJECTED, history says the risk-off is often nearing its
end — so we ILLUSTRATE that turn (a "↘ receding / TURN" panel on the .rrx card) rather than
leave the user staring at a still-red alert.

HONESTY (this never moves money on its own):
  • The rising radar earns the right to CAP Market State because its legs cleared a strict
    forward-lift bar. This recovery read has NOT been forward-tested to that bar yet, so it is
    a CONTEXT ILLUSTRATION only. It is wired in as a display-only sibling field on the radar
    view-model and DOES NOT relax the radar's one-directional score ceiling
    (engine/market_state._radar_override) — the guardrail stays intact.
  • The de-risk → re-risk response is SIZING: scale exposure back in deliberately, in tranches,
    keep stops, let price confirm. Never a single buy call.
  • BoJ has no isolated easing detector freely available, so it enters ONLY via the aggregate
    global central-bank tide (global_liquidity, which sums Fed+ECB+BoJ); the chip says so.
  • Every input is display-only context already on the page; every field degrades to absent,
    never crashes the build.

MARKET CHANNEL (added W1, RRX-R2..R7):
  • engine/risk_radar_market_catalysts.py adds 7 market-internal confirmation chips (C1–C7)
    plus a vol-instability veto (C8). Each chip is ACCRUING / display-only — not forward-tested
    yet. Forward-grading is managed by engine/risk_radar_recovery_audit.py on the rebound ruler
    pre-declared in research/RISK_RADAR_EXPANSION_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md §3.
  • turn_confirmed_full (new sibling key) = liquidity channel AND market channel confirmed.
    The existing turn_confirmed field is UNCHANGED for backward compat.
  • channels dict (new sibling key) exposes {liquidity, market, veto} booleans separately.
