"""engine.etf_board_ledger — forward measurement ledger for the ETF consensus board.

ETF page upgrade masterplan §3 W3. The Fund Flows board (``etfs.html``) has never
carried a measurement loop: it publishes a ranked consensus board every night and
nothing anywhere records what those names then did. This module is the missing
half — an append-only fire log of the board as it was published, plus a derived
forward-return store that fills in as each window matures.

THREE ARTIFACTS, three different jobs:

  ``data/etf_board_ledger/snapshots.jsonl``   — the PIT fire log. One JSON object
      per (as_of, ticker) on the night that board shipped, keep-FIRST: a row that
      already exists for a board date is NEVER rewritten. This is the evidence;
      everything else is derived and may be recomputed.

  ``data/etf_board_ledger/retro_grades.parquet`` — the derived grade store. One row
      per (as_of, ticker, horizon). Price-derived columns are FROZEN at first grade
      (``_FROZEN_PRICE_COLS``) exactly as ``scripts/grade_us_board.py`` freezes its
      own: the price ladder can re-base a series underneath us, so a keep-FRESH
      merge would silently restate an already-published measurement.

  ``site/factordata/etf_board_track.json``  — the small display projection the
      Calibration Lab reads. Summary per horizon + a capped tail of graded rows.

LANE LAW (house rule: nightly is the sole advancer of forward ledgers; masterplan
§0.7). Every ``data/`` write here is gated on
``engine.ledger_lane.nightly_advance_enabled()`` (``COLLECT_LANE=nightly``), fail-
closed, exactly like ``engine.board_ledger.append_board``. Off-lane the append and
the merge return without touching the filesystem — no file is created — so a render,
an intraday lane, or a local experiment can read and project the ledger but can
never advance it. The ``site/`` projection is derived from what is already on disk
and is therefore safe in any lane (same split as the Price Pressure lobe: ledger
gated, display artifact rebuilt anywhere).

WHAT THIS IS NOT. Display tier, context only. Nothing here feeds a rank, a score, a
gate or a size, and no ranking on etfs.html consults it. It exists so that a FUTURE
promotion (masterplan §4 — predictive fund weighting) has real forward evidence to
be gauntleted against instead of an assertion. Until then the honest reading of a
thin ledger is "collecting", and the surface says so.

SCHEMA TOLERANCE. Sibling waves are still adding fields to the consensus row
(flow/selection dollars, persistence, coverage flags). ``snapshot_record`` persists
whatever scalar fields the row carries, by iteration rather than by a hard-coded
column list, so a new engine field starts accruing the night it ships and an ABSENT
field is simply absent — never a crash. Heavy nested values (sparkline trajectories,
per-fund history) are dropped: the fire log has to stay small enough to commit every
night for years.

    missing from that night's panel, a board date the bench series does not reach),
    and freezing the bench leg on the name's maturity wrote those nulls in forever —
    the row would sit graded-but-uncomparable for the rest of the ledger's life,
    quietly shrinking the "x of y ahead of SPY" denominator with no disclosure.
    ``excess_bench`` is then RE-DERIVED from whichever pair survived, so the printed
    difference always equals the two numbers printed beside it. Where both legs were
    already frozen this recomputes the same value it replaces; where only the bench
    newly filled it publishes a first measurement, which is not a restatement.
