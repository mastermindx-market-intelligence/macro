"""DISCOVERY / scan layer — admit pre-consensus names the five desks MISS.

The Intelligence Hub's universe is the set-union of names the feeders already
surfaced (engine/intelligence.py) — every feeder is a recognition gate, so a name
that nobody is writing about, that isn't on a buy-list, and whose tape hasn't
diverged is invisible by construction. This module scans LEADING sources directly
for OFF-DESK candidates and hands them to the hub so accumulation can surface
BEFORE a lagging desk flags it.

Two feeds (both already collected, neither consumed by the hub today):

  • RADAR QUIET-but-accumulating — the divergence radar computes a full signal
    (signal_score / channels / crowd / options / activity) for QUIET names too,
    then engine.intelligence DROPS them (`_radar_for` returns None on QUIET). A
    QUIET name with a real, multi-channel, uncrowded, not-extended signal is
    accumulation before a divergence forms — exactly the pre-consensus setup.

  • FEDERAL contract-award VELOCITY — data/usaspending/obligations.parquet is a
    dates × tickers matrix of obligated $ for ~41 federal-exposed names with the
    ticker crosswalk already resolved (curated, narrow by design). Accelerating
    obligated $ = funded backlog → revenue over 1-4q, before the tape prices it.

CONTEXT-ONLY · DEGRADE-NEVER-RAISE · PURE (load_* read artifacts). Nothing here
scores or sizes; it republishes leading signals the hub was throwing away.
