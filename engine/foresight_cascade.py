"""Foresight Cascade — the per-theme STAGE machine of the Thematic Foresight Desk
(research/THEMATIC_FORESIGHT_DESK.md). v1 = T1 (bottleneck) x T4 (revision breadth).

The desk's one number is not a score, it is a STAGE — where the leading edge of a theme
is right now — because that is what tells you whether there is edge REMAINING:

  PRECIPICE   bottleneck TIGHT + revision breadth FLAT/low      -> early; thesis; size small
              (the June-2024 HBM state: supply sold out, estimates not yet moving)
  BROADENING  bottleneck TIGHT + breadth RISING/positive        -> revision wave underway; runway confirmed
  RE-RATING   breadth already broad/high                        -> late; await dislocation, do NOT chase
  GLUT-RISK   bottleneck LOOSE while estimates still high        -> supply catching up; exit clock
  WATCH       neither firing                                    -> nothing here yet

Entry is NOT decided here. Detection tells you WHAT and THAT IT'S DURABLE; it does not tell
you WHEN to pay up. The buy is deferred to the dislocation/anticipation overlay (wired in
Phase 1) — 13D was right and ~9 months early, and the real HBM entry was the early-2025
tariff flush, not the day estimates ticked up. DISPLAY-ONLY; ranks by EDGE REMAINING
(PRECIPICE first), per the house convention that elevated agreement is late, not better.
