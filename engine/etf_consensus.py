"""Cross-fund consensus over the ETF holdings radar — "which stocks are the
curated/active funds collectively favoring, and where is real position-sizing
moving?"

This sits ON TOP of ``engine.holdings_signals`` (the per-fund flow-normalized
share-decision engine, D71) and adds three read-only, display-only aggregations
for the rebuilt ``etfs.html``:

  * ``consensus_favored`` — group every flagged fund decision by the STOCK it
    touched, so a name accumulated by several funds at once (real cross-manager
    conviction) rises above a single fund's idiosyncratic add.
  * ``weight_trajectory`` — the last N daily weight_pct readings for one
    (fund, ticker) pair, so the page can draw a sparkline of position sizing
    growing / shrinking over time.
  * ``fund_coverage`` — per-fund freshness + depth (latest snapshot, #snapshots,
    sponsor, theme), so the page can show the whole tracked universe and surface
    any feed that has gone stale.

Everything here is additive and degrade-never-raise: a missing store, an
unreadable parquet, or an engine error yields ``[]`` / ``None`` and the page
simply hides that panel. It NEVER feeds a score, size, or allocation path — same
contract as the rest of the holdings plane.

# W2b structural weighting lens (masterplan §4) — a SECOND WAY TO READ the same
# board, never the board's order.
#
# The operator's question was "should some funds count more?". Fitting weights to
# forward returns is the obvious answer and the wrong one here: most funds carry
# weeks of history, so a fitted weight is a promotion-to-authority move on an
# honest-N of nearly nothing (§4, rejected; the W3 ledger accrues what a future
# gauntlet would need). What IS defensible is structural — three mechanical
# factors, no parameter learned from any outcome:
#
#   (a) SIGNAL-TYPE MATCH. Each fund type only really reports one of the two
#       components W1 separates. A passive basket's "selection" is mostly index
#       reconstitution and an active fund's "flow" is mostly its sponsor's
#       marketing, so the MISMATCHED component is kept — it is not noise-free
#       zero — at `mismatch_discount`.
#   (b) $ MAGNITUDE. Aggregation runs on the dollars W1 already computed, so a
#       $4B fund moving 0.5pp stops reading like a $30M fund moving 0.5pp. The
#       equal-weight COUNTS are untouched beside it: breadth is the most
#       manipulation-resistant stat on the page and stays the primary read.
#   (c) FRESHNESS. A fund that has not published since last month is not part of
#       "this cycle" — its events are excluded from the weighted aggregates and
#       counted in the receipt, rather than silently aging into the number.
#
# Everything here is additive. `consensus_favored`'s sort key does not read one
# field of it, and a test pins that the default board is byte-identical.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

    accumulation surfaces first.

    ``min_funds`` (default 1) filters out single-fund names from the headline
    board — a name multiple funds touch is the stronger cross-manager read.

    ``selection_usd`` (with ``n_funds_usd``/``usd_complete`` disclosing how much
    of the row the dollar estimate actually covers), ``n_funds_flow`` vs
