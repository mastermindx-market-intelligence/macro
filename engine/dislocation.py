"""Dislocation Gate-1 — the Fed-put master switch that CONDITIONS the capitulation
gauge (the missing veto from the narrative-shock research).

ADDITIVE / LEAF module. It never touches the split-half-validated quad and nothing
in the scoring path imports it. engine.run writes its snapshot to
latest.json["dislocation"]; it never crashes the run.

DEGRADE CONTRACT (corrected 2026-07-29 — the previous docstring claimed "a missing
input degrades to verdict=unknown", which was FALSE for the two verdict-deciding
legs). The verdict turns on exactly two readings: real-time Sahm and the smoothed
10y breakeven. A missing or STALE leg used to read as "leg not firing" -> put
present -> buyable_washout, i.e. a data outage failed OPEN toward the permissive
verdict. Each leg now carries a staleness budget measured against its OWN last
carried stamp (`sahm_max_stale_bd`, `breakeven_max_stale_bd`); on absence or breach
`put_state` becomes "unknown", `stale_inputs` names the offending legs, and — when a
dislocation is actually live, so the verdict really does depend on the dead leg —
`verdict` becomes "unknown" instead of "buyable_washout". A CALM read is unaffected
by design: `dislocation_active` is a pure OR of VIX / drawdown / VRP /
term-structure readings and never consults either put leg, so "calm" stays honest
with both legs dead.

WHY IT EXISTS. engine.conditions already detects capitulation (VRP extreme + VIX
panic + COT washout) and advertises a measured "+9.3%/86% bounce". The dislocation
research (scripts/research_dislocation.py, research/DISLOCATION_VALIDATION.md)
showed on SPY 1997-2026 that this UNCONDITIONAL read is survivorship-inflated: the
AQR null holds (panic-buying alone does not beat staying invested), and the same
capitulation signals fired into the 2000/2008/2022 declines. What separates a
buyable washout from a knife — out-of-sample, in BOTH split-halves — is the
FED-PUT MASTER SWITCH:

    PUT-ABSENT  = recession (real-time Sahm >= 0.50)
                  OR Fed-put-off (sustained 10y breakeven >= 2.5%, inflation
                  blocks easing)
    PUT-PRESENT = neither.

MEASURED (episode block bootstrap, ~10 put-absent crises): put-present washouts
had ~4pp SHALLOWER MEDIAN 3-month drawdown than put-absent — the ONE effect whose
95% CI excludes zero ([+0.3, +6.3]). The larger hit-rate / 1-year-tail gaps point
the same way but their CIs span zero at this effective sample, so they are carried
by SIGN-CONSISTENCY (leave-one-year-out 26/28, both split-halves), NOT by
significance. This is a RISK / DRAWDOWN FILTER, not a return signal — surfaced
with that honesty, never as alpha.

WHAT THE DECLUSTERED REPLAY ACTUALLY SHOWS (do not overclaim the veto). The gate
REFUSED the 2008 crash — put_absent from 2008-04 through the trough. It did NOT
refuse everything: it printed buyable_washout three times early in the 2000-02
bear (first on 2000-09-06 at a −2.4% drawdown, fwd252 −25.1%) and twice inside 2022
(2022-01-21 and 2022-07-12), both 2022 prints with the 21d breakeven within 0.02pp
of the 2.5% cutoff — i.e. on the wrong side of a knife-edge, not comfortably clear
of it. So the honest claim is "refused 2008; printed buyable early in 2000 and twice
in 2022 within 0.02pp of the threshold", NEVER "the whole edge is in refusing the
2000/2008/2022 falling knife".
