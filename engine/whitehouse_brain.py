"""White House alert brain — the Claude-Opus policy analyst.

LEAF · GATED · CONTEXT-ONLY · DEGRADE-NEVER-RAISE. For each NEW White House
announcement (engine.whitehouse_feed) this asks Claude Opus to do the judgement a
keyword rule can't:

  1. SIGNIFICANCE — is this market-moving enough to earn a site-wide alert banner?
     The vast majority of WH posts (proclamations, ceremonial days, nomination
     lists, personnel notes) are NOT. Only a genuinely market-relevant policy
     action — tariffs, sanctions, a sector-shaping executive order, fiscal /
     regulatory / energy / defense / health / tech moves — clears the bar.
  2. If it clears it: a concise BANNER TITLE that states the market importance
     (not just the headline), a banner LIFESPAN (1-7 days, scaled to durability),
     an overall TONE, and a full REPORT — implications, why it matters, analysis,
     the SECTORS facing head/tailwinds, and the specific liquid US-listed TICKERS
     that benefit, each with a one-line thesis.
  3. If it does NOT clear it: `activate=false` and nothing else is written — no
     banner, no report (per the desk's contract).

AUTH (the "Opus brain via the CLI"): Claude via the user's Claude-Code OAuth token
(CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN → the SDK `auth_token=` Bearer path + the required
`anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20` header), model claude-opus-4-8. Falls back to an
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, then a DeepSeek reasoning model (Anthropic-compatible endpoint)
so the desk still runs in CI without the subscription token. No provider → a clean
no-op (the item is marked seen / inactive).

This is analysis, never advice or a trade signal. Nothing in the scoring path
imports it; the tickers it names feed no score, size, or allocation.

    "restatement of the headline (e.g. 'Trump 25% auto tariff — supplier margins squeezed, "
    "domestic OEMs shielded'). This is what scrolls on the ticker.\n"
    "- importance: 0-100, how broadly market-moving (100 = a sweeping tariff regime or a "
    "Fed-level shock; 60 = a real but contained sector action). Below ~60 you should "
    "usually NOT activate.\n"
    "- banner_days: integer 1-7 — how long the banner should stay live, scaled to how "
    "DURABLE the market impact is (a one-day headline = 1-2; a structural policy shift = "
    "5-7).\n"
    "- tone: overall market read — 'tailwind' (net risk-positive / pro-growth), 'headwind' "
    "(net risk-negative), 'mixed' (clear winners AND losers), or 'neutral'.\n"
    "- summary: 1-2 sentences a reader sees first.\n"
    "- analysis: 2-4 short paragraphs — what the action actually does, WHY it matters for "
    "markets, the transmission mechanism, and the key uncertainty. Plain prose, no advice.\n"
    "- sectors: the industries facing a tailwind or headwind, each with a one-line "
    "rationale.\n"

    "direction ('benefit' or 'hurt') and a one-line thesis tying it to the action. Name "

    "You are a senior macro-liquidity strategist for a solo trader's dashboard. You are "
    "handed a PRE-DETECTED, quantified move in the Treasury General Account (TGA) — the "

    "liquidity/regime backdrop already spelled out in the text below. The numbers are given; "
    "your job is the MARKET READ, in two stages.\n\n"
    "MECHANISM (ground truth): when the TGA FALLS, Treasury is spending cash that lands in "
    "private bank deposits and reserve balances — a mechanical liquidity INJECTION that adds "
    "to the system; when the TGA RISES (a rebuild), Treasury is pulling cash OUT of reserves "
    "— a mechanical DRAIN. The impact on risk assets is largest when the overnight RRP buffer "
    "is near-exhausted (the flow hits bank reserves directly instead of draining RRP first) "
    "and is amplified or muted by the net-liquidity trend and regime given in the text.\n\n"
    "STAGE 1 — SIGNIFICANCE GATE. Decide whether THIS move warrants a site-wide banner. Be "
    "selective and context-dependent: routine mid-month/quarterly tax-date swings of roughly "
    "$40-80bn that quickly reverse are usually NOT banner-worthy. ACTIVATE for genuinely "
    "market-relevant plumbing: multi-hundred-billion quarter-end releases or rebuilds, "
    "debt-ceiling-driven cash draw-downs or post-resolution refills, or a sizeable drawdown "
    "landing into an already-exhausted RRP buffer — i.e. a move big and durable enough to "
    "measurably backstop or tighten the tape.\n\n"
    "STAGE 2 — only if it clears the gate. Write the read:\n"
    "- banner_title: ONE punchy line (<=90 chars) stating the MARKET significance (e.g. "
    "'Treasury spends down $175bn quarter-end cash — reserves injection backstops the tape').\n"
    "- importance: 0-100 (100 = a system-level liquidity shock; 60 = a real but contained "
    "flow). Below ~60 you should usually NOT activate.\n"
    "- banner_days: 1-7, scaled to how durable the liquidity impulse is (a one-day tax swing "
    "= 1-2; a multi-week quarter-end drawdown = 5-7).\n"
    "- tone: the market read — 'tailwind' for a reserves INJECTION (TGA drawdown), 'headwind' "
    "for a DRAIN (TGA rebuild), 'mixed' when the net effect is genuinely ambiguous (e.g. a "
    "drawdown offset by heavy coupon settlement), 'neutral' if truly de-minimis.\n"
    "- summary: 1-2 sentences a reader sees first.\n"
    "- analysis: 2-4 short paragraphs — the mechanism, HOW it conditions the CURRENT tape "
    "(is it backstopping an incipient drawdown or amplifying a selloff?), which factor/sector "
    "complexion it favors (a reserves injection into an exhausted RRP typically supports the "
    "long-duration, rate-sensitive megacap-growth complex over defensives; a drain does the "
    "reverse), and — confirmation over prediction — what would FALSIFY the read (e.g. the "
    "drawdown reverses within days, or a coupon-settlement drain offsets it). Be blunt and "
    "honest; never claim to know more than the market or to time it.\n"
    "- sectors: the sector/factor complexion facing a tailwind or headwind, each with a "
    "one-line rationale (e.g. 'Megacap growth — reserves injection eases the marginal "
    "discount-rate pressure').\n"
    "- tickers: specific, LIQUID, US-LISTED names or ETFs plausibly sensitive to the liquidity "
    "swing (index/duration/rate-sensitive proxies are fair game — e.g. QQQ, TLT, IWM — as well "
    "as individual megacaps), each with direction ('benefit'|'hurt') and a one-line thesis. "
