"""Signal Lab — the honest, consolidated validation scorecard.

The dashboard already runs an institutional-grade validation battery
(``engine.validation``: deflated Sharpe, purged k-fold + embargo, block
bootstrap, Newey-West HAC t-stats, Benjamini-Hochberg FDR, Brier/Platt
calibration, cost-aware backtests) across ~25 ``scripts/*_phase0.py`` /
``validate_*.py`` harnesses.  The verdicts have lived only in ``reports/*.md``
and a ``data/edgar/ic_scorecard.json`` wired to nothing.

This module assembles those verdicts into ONE structured payload so a single
page can show, per signal: rank-IC, IC-IR, Newey-West HAC t, BH-FDR q,
Deflated Sharpe, backtest Sharpe, hit-rate, n — and crucially the *verdict*,
including the signals we **measured and refused to ship**.  Publishing the
graveyard is the point: it is the difference between a dashboard and a model.

It is a pure assembler — no new computation, no new data.  The 11-factor
cross-section is read LIVE from ``ic_scorecard.json`` so it stays current; the
rest is a curated registry whose every number is quoted from a named report in
``reports/`` (the ``source`` field), so the page is auditable.

# --- BTC Vector: promotion stats sourced from the calibrator, not typed --------

# at build time from data/vector/{calibration,trial_log}.json — the artifacts
# ``scripts/calibrate_vector.py`` writes. ``_BTC_VECTOR_FROZEN`` is the fallback
# for a data-less build (fresh clone / CI without the store); it is a stamped
# quote of that same artifact, never an independent number.
#
# Why this plumbing exists: the card shipped "DSR 0.9945 (n=68 = 65 base + 3
# override dof_cost)" long after the Override Registry grew midterm_blackout to
# dof_cost=6 (n=71), AND after the headline DSR moved onto the block-bootstrap
# T_eff basis — so a card claiming 0.9945 sat next to an engine computing 0.9661.
# A hardcoded promotion stat cannot survive its own engine being re-run; the
# only durable fix is to read the number the calibrator actually produced.
