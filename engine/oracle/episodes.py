"""Oracle O2 — Episode layer: hysteresis state machine + rotation episode catalog.

WHAT
----
Detects rotation *episodes* — persistent directional relative-strength moves
by a node — and catalogs them with onset, confirmation, exhaustion dates plus
forward-outcome columns.  Consumes the O0 rotation panel (panel.py) and,
optionally, the P2a rotation-groups file.

WHY
---
group_flow Phase-0 tested daily cross-sectional rank-IC of fingerprint legs and
found noise.  Oracle tests *conditional persistence of detected episodes*
(onset-gated, confirmed states with hysteresis) — a different quantity.
The prior is informative: expect modest, regime-conditional edges; the system
must be valuable as a risk/exposure router even if the persistence null holds.

HONESTY FRAMING
---------------
* accel_z raw run median is 2 days (p90=5 — measured on panel_s 1998–2026).
  Single-day threshold crossings are noise.  ALL onset tests require a 5-day
  smoothed accel_z (accel_z_5d) to suppress this.
* Outcome columns are LOOK-AHEAD free: they use only forward price data that
  post-dates the detection timestamp.  Episodes whose outcome window extends
  past the panel's last date receive outcome=NaN + outcome_mature=False —
  never partially-filled forward windows.
* Two-sided pairing requires overlapping opposite-direction episodes on the
  SAME panel — rotation_groups.json is consumed when present (P2a) but the
  module degrades gracefully to node-level overlap pairing when it is absent.
* Tier-M survivorship watermark (declared-hindsight membership) propagates
  through the episode catalog: episodes on Tier-M nodes carry survivorship_flagged=True.

PUBLIC API
----------
run_state_machine(node_series, cfg=None) → list[EpisodeRow]
    Pure function over one node's panel slice.  Returns raw episode dicts.

build_episodes(panel, rotation_groups=None, cfg=None) → pd.DataFrame
    Run the state machine over every node in `panel` and assemble the catalog.
    Adds outcome columns and two-sided pairing.

EPISODE_CFG (one dict, all thresholds)
---------------------------------------
All defaults are grounded in §4 of ORACLE_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md + measured
distributions on the real panels (2026-07-04 census).  Provenance comment on
each value.  They will be re-tuned in the Phase-3 calibration; scatter is
impossible — every knob lives here.

    """Run the episode state machine over every node in panel.

    Parameters
    ----------
    panel : pd.DataFrame
        MultiIndex (node, date) Oracle rotation panel from panel.py.
        Tier S or Tier M — caller passes which.
    rotation_groups : dict | None
        Parsed data/oracle/rotation_groups.json from P2a (optional).
        When None, two-sided pairing falls back to same-panel overlap.
    tier : str
        "s" = survivorship-clean (Tier S), "m" = survivorship-flagged (Tier M).
        Controls the survivorship_flagged field on each episode.
    cfg : dict | None
        Override EPISODE_CFG keys.

    Returns
    -------
    pd.DataFrame
        One row per episode with columns from _EPISODE_COLS + outcome columns.
        Sorted by onset_date.  Empty DataFrame if no episodes detected.

    Notes
    -----
    * The state machine is run per-node over the node's full history.
    * Outcome columns are added in a SEPARATE pass after all episodes are
      detected to enforce the no-lookahead invariant: detection code can never
      accidentally branch on outcome data.
    * Two-sided pairing is also a post-detection pass.
