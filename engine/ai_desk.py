"""AI Desk — the accountable analyst layer (LLM Tier-C, CONTEXT-ONLY).

LEAF · GATED · DEFAULT-OFF · NEVER-SCORED. This is the inference layer that sits on
top of the dashboard's TRUST-GRADED detection engines and turns detection into
*falsifiable, accountable directional leans*:

  • Engine-1 thematic/sector flow  (engine.group_flow → site/basketdata/flow.json)
  • Engine-2 regime-snap relief radar (engine.regime_snap → data/regime/regime_snap.json)

Both were deliberately built DISPLAY-ONLY because Phase-0 validation proved they
DETECT where flow concentrates / when a relief snap fires but CANNOT predict forward
returns. The whole point of that discipline was to hand a trust-graded signal to a
layer that can make the durability judgement a mechanical leg structurally can't.

WHY THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM master_brain (the morning note): a fluent brief that
never learns it was wrong is a horoscope. Durability comes from a falsifiability
loop, the Phase-0 discipline applied to the AI's OWN output:

  Quant DETECTS (trust-graded) → AI JUDGES (accountable) → track-record GATES (later).

Every thesis the desk emits carries a CONDITIONAL DIRECTIONAL LEAN, a human
falsifier, AND an ENGINE-DERIVED machine-checkable predicate + a check-by date, and
is appended to data/ai_desk/theses.jsonl. A future scorer (Phase C,
engine.ai_desk_scorer) evaluates those predicates against realized closes and feeds
the measured hit-rate back into conviction. The ledger MUST start accruing the day
this ships — you cannot retro-fit falsifiers onto calls already made.

Discipline (mirrors master_brain + regime_snap_veto):
  * CONTEXT-ONLY — a lean is NEVER a number in any score / size / allocation; nothing
    in axes / regime / conditions imports this module. It writes a SEPARATE artifact.
  * NEVER SIZED, NEVER A TRADE — the output is a lean (overweight / underweight /
    fade-fear / avoid) and what would invalidate it, not a weight or an order.
  * GROUNDED + GUARD-RAILED — it reasons over the deterministic detector state and
    carries flow.json's own ai_handoff guardrails (do_not_conclude / ai_directive /
    caveats) INLINE, and is told to honour them and not to fabricate.
  * FIREWALLED + graceful — needs DEEPSEEK_API_KEY; absent the key, disabled, or with
    no detector artifacts present it returns None and never raises into the pipeline.
  * ACCOUNTABLE BY CONSTRUCTION — the MODEL authors the judgement; the ENGINE derives
    the machine-checkable falsifier from (subject, lean, horizon), so every logged
    thesis is scorable (or explicitly marked 'soft' → unscored, never fudged).

Runs on DeepSeek V4 Pro via its Anthropic-compatible endpoint by default (reuses
master_brain's client); one config line swaps it to Claude Opus.
