"""The owner's WEIGHTED tier cascade for the Standout grids — extends signal_gate.

A single signal is one DOOR in a cascade (the sector-cycle engine + the owner's
leadership/rotation read are the other doors); this grades a name into the owner's
ladder, strongest-confirmed -> earliest, each tier weighted by its held-out balance of
earliness-vs-stop-out. Every return carries ``anchor_era`` = ANCHOR_ERA: the 2D/3D buckets
are anchored to an ABSOLUTE session calendar (engine/session_anchor), not to the caller's
first timestamp, so a verdict is a function of the price history alone — ruling
research/SESSION_ANCHOR_ABSOLUTE_CALENDAR_ADJUDICATION_BY_FABLE.md.
Tier table (research/signal_engine/TIERED_CASCADE.md, 110 held-out US names):

  TIER  WEIGHT  definition                                              held-out stop-out
  T1    0.90    3D MACD-RSI x 3D StochRSI, buy-filter endorsed (master)   38.3%   (= signal_gate TAKE)
  T2    1.00    2D MACD-RSI cross  & 3D StochRSI crossed (recent)         40.6%   (operator re-ranked above T1 2026-07-06)
  T3    0.60    2D MACD-RSI PROJECTED<=1-2d & 3D StochRSI already crossed 42.3%   (the early prediction)
  T4    0.40    2D MACD-RSI PROJECTED & 2D StochRSI crossed & ABOVE-200MA 43.1%   (earliest; anti-falling-knife)

Temporal provenance is tier-native and never borrowed from the §7 marker by accident:
``tier_event_date`` is the immutable close that fired T1/T2, while projected T3/T4 carry
null there; ``tier_observed_date`` is the daily session whose close produced this verdict.
The two are equal only for a same-session fire.  ``tier_observation_provisional`` names
forming T1 and projected T3/T4 without changing the incumbent calibrated ``provisional``
badge (which remains T3-only and has downstream display behaviour).

The gradient is GENTLE (~5pp master->earliest) so the earlier tiers get REAL weight, not
token. `sub` = the StochRSI cross came from DEEP oversold (<20) vs a SHALLOW cross (>20).
The assessment found shallow crosses are NOT lower quality (lower stop-out, calmer pullback),
so `sub` is a DISPLAY modifier only — it never lowers the tier weight.

T1 is the validated master (passed in as `take_active` from signal_quality.analyze, so the
chart marker and the grid tier never disagree). T2/T3/T4 are computed here from the daily
close — faithful RSI-MACD (NOT price MACD), leak-free 2D/3D->daily known-date mapping,
close-only (works on every market incl. close-only HK/CN). T4's PROJECTION is leak-free: it
extrapolates the 2D MACD histogram forward from PAST bars only; it never reads the future.

# ── HISTORY FLOOR — the MEASURED warmup requirement, not a round number ──────────────────
# Operator order 2026-08-05 ("200 bar indicator floor, lets lift this?"). The incumbent
# MIN_HISTORY = 200 was a round number matching NO leg's actual warmup: it simultaneously
# locked out names on which every T2/T3 leg was ALREADY computable (159 bars) and admitted
# names on which the 3D RSI-MACD leg was STILL NaN (needs 232) — so the not-topped veto's
# macd_bear leg has been silently fail-open on every 200-231 bar name since the floor was set.
#
# Every number below was MEASURED, not derived, and RE-MEASURED under the absolute session
# anchor (R7, era abs-session-2026-08-06). Buckets are now phased to a fixed reference
# calendar, so a trailing N-bar window's bucket count depends on WHERE the window sits: the
# same N yields ceil(N/n) TF bars when the window starts on a bucket boundary and one MORE
# when it straddles. The floor must therefore be the PHASE-WORST case, not one lucky
# alignment. Basis: REAL NYSE sessions (lib.nyse_calendar) ending 2026-08-04 — real phases,
# real holidays — with the window slid across 14 consecutive reference sessions, which
# covers every 2D/3D/weekly/fortnight phase. Method per offset: truncate to N trailing daily
# bars, ask whether the leg is non-NaN at the final bar, take the smallest N that holds for
# all N' >= N; the tabled floor is the MAX over offsets.
#
# OUTCOME: every session-counted leg re-measured to its INCUMBENT value — the phase-worst
# case IS the old phase-0 business-day measurement, because a window that starts exactly on a
# bucket boundary yields ceil(N/n) TF bars either way, and a real session maps to a
# CONSECUTIVE reference position (holidays are absent from both sides). MIN_HISTORY therefore
# stays 159 and no cohort boundary moves under this era.
#
# The two CALENDAR-WEEK legs (`wbull`, `htf_2w`) are the exception, and NOT because of the
# anchor: `wbull` runs on the untouched pandas W-FRI path, and both are dominated by how many
# calendar weeks a window spans, which depends on HOLIDAY DENSITY rather than bucket phase.
# On real sessions they measure lower (14-phase worst case 376 / 759; worst over a decade of
# window ends 379 / 764) than the tabled 391 / 776. The tabled values are kept: they are the
# NO-HOLIDAY worst case, they are the null-SAFE direction (over-disclosing a leg as
# not-yet-knowable costs nothing; under-disclosing asserts a leg is live when it is not —
# the PLTR error class), neither leg gates any tier, and relaxing them is a separate decision
# from this anchor change (R8 keeps warmup-floor SEMANTICS put). Both numbers are pinned in
# tests/test_confluence_warmup_floor.py so the gap is measured, not assumed.

    interior rows read the last COMPLETED bucket, but the FINAL row sits on the in-progress
    partial bucket `_tf_bars` still emits — the live board's provisional basis. The last row
    and the interior rows are therefore NOT one basis; a consumer reading a historical day D
    must truncate the series at D BEFORE calling (the prophet_stage_shadow pattern), or its
    day-D read can differ from what the gate saw on ~8% of days. Settled-day parity with
    :func:`cascade` is pinned by tests/test_provisional_replay.py::
    test_tier_stream_matches_cascade_on_settled_days (reproduction requires take_active=True;
    cascade awards no T1 from the raw cross alone, and the live board's §7-validated T1 set
    is NOT a subset of this stream's — 5/18 sampled live T1 days were absent here).

    The provisional-basis replay compares this stream (completed buckets) against the per-day live
    ``cascade`` (provisional tail) to measure the repaint (#22). T1 here uses the raw 3D RSI-MACD
    cross as ``take`` (cascade's own fallback when no §7 take_date is supplied), so the stream is a
    self-contained close-only signal; the live board's T1 (validated §7 master) is a strict subset.

    Returns a daily-indexed frame: tier (T1..T4|None), weight, ticks, not_topped, eligible, sub,
    s1/s2 and a constant ``anchor_era`` column (R5 — the bucketing era every row belongs to).
