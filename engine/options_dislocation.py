"""engine/options_dislocation.py — options information-dislocation feature layer.

WHAT THIS IS. A per-(date, underlying) block of options-surface primitives computed from
the chain snapshots the GEX desk already persists (data/polygon_gex/chains/<date>.parquet),
each **cross-sectionally neutralised against implied-volatility LEVEL and size** before it is
allowed to mean anything. Plus four categorical READS (confirmation / crowding / vol-regime /
pre-event) built from named primitives, and a forward-accruing ledger + dormant gate.

WHY NEUTRALISATION IS THE WHOLE POINT (measured here, 2026-08-05, 41 chain dates × 392 names).
Run naively, almost every "options information" feature is a repackaged bet on implied-vol
LEVEL — a long-known priced characteristic, not information. Measured on our own panel, raw
per-date cross-sectional rank IC vs SPY-relative 5d forward returns, then again after
per-date rank-space residualisation on (iv30, log spot):

    feature          raw IC5    neutralised IC5   what survived
    em30             -0.2297    (IS iv30)         nothing — expected move IS the IV level
    iv_rv            -0.1090    -0.0148           86% of it was the vol level
    turn             -0.0599    -0.0071           dies, and flips sub-period
    kv_conc          +0.0403    +0.0065           dies, and flips sub-period
    term_slope       -0.0922    -0.0402           survives, halved
    oi_tilt          -0.0673    -0.0873           survives and STRENGTHENS

An engine that skipped this step would ship `event_expected_move_gap` at an apparent
IC of −0.23 (t≈−9) and be, in fact, short high-vol stocks in one six-week window.

WHAT THE PANEL CANNOT DO. 41 trading dates in ONE regime. At h=5 that is ~8 independent
windows; at h=21 it is ~1. Every t-statistic on this panel is vacuous by construction —
overlapping windows inside a single regime. Nothing here is validated, and no number in
this module may be described as such. What the diagnostics above DO establish is narrower
and still worth shipping: which primitives are not merely IV level wearing a hat. The gate
(scripts/validate_options_dislocation.py) stays dormant until the panel reaches 120 dates.

SHAPE LAW — WHY THERE ARE READS AND NOT SCORES (binding: OPTIONS_NW_ENTRY_INTELLIGENCE
_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE RO-2 / Signal Commons R3). Fused escalating composites are a FORBIDDEN
shape pre-gate: "no ... scores, or ranks anywhere a reader can lift them pre-gate ... Any
summary of options state may only ever be a post-hoc roll-up of already-gated survivors."
So the four multi-primitive families ship as CATEGORICAL reads over named, separately-visible
primitives — never a 0-100 or −3..+3 number. Only genuinely single-primitive measures
(skew acceleration; the pre-event implied/realised move gap) carry a numeric value, because
a single measured quantity is not a fusion. Per RO-3 the reads are caution/context-only and
may only ever LOWER confidence in a candidate — never originate or escalate one.

MEASURED NULLS, PRINTED NOT HIDDEN (house epistemics; "nulls printed, not hidden").
Trade-direction-dependent features are NOT computable on our entitlements and the cheap
substitutes are measured dead, so they are emitted as explicit nulls carrying their evidence
rather than silently omitted — see `MEASURED_NULLS`. `research/OPTIONS_FLOW_DATA.md`: OPRA
trades+NBBO are 403 on our plan; the minute tick-rule recovers a contract's net daily sign
at 0.41 — worse than a coin flip — and delta-adjustment was tested and REJECTED (0.39).
On our own panel the two bar-only directional proxies flip sign between sub-periods
(call-vs-put volume tilt +0.049 → −0.030; delta-weighted +0.006 → −0.044). Cboe Open-Close
(the dataset Pan-Poteshman used) would supply the real thing at ~$2,000/mo and is already
adjudicated DENIED (RO-10, W6 SKIP-ALL) — do not re-propose it here.

REGISTRY ADJACENCY — DECLARED, NOT EVADED (research/DO_NOT_REBUILD.md).
  * "DOI (options delta-OI family) | DEAD" — that kill closed DOI *persistence tested at
    SECTOR-ETF level* (W-E1, 0/12 on ~24 roots). `oi_tilt` here is a different construction
    on a different population: a single-name CROSS-SECTIONAL, IV-level-neutralised standing
    positioning tilt over ~390 names. The masterplan lists single-name cross-sectional claims
    as BLOCKED ON DATA ("Store has only NVDA"), i.e. never tested — not killed. It ships
    display-only, and it does not revive DOI or claim the kill was wrong.
  * "Skew-deceleration | UNSUPPORTED" — that kill closed the *bullish-deceleration*
    hypothesis. W-E1's lone survivor pointed OPPOSITE the bullish premise; `skew_accel` here
    is that opposite sign (rising skew → lower forward returns), so this is concordant with
    the existing evidence, not a re-litigation of the killed direction.

      * GAPS.  Even session-only, the store's collection outages stretch the remaining
        windows (6→2,490, 7→1,485, 8→356).  Calendar resolution fixes those exactly
        when the endpoint exists and refuses when it does not: 86.4% measurable,
