"""Bucket grids and the known-ts map each producer's own convention implies.

**The whole point of this module is that no grid is re-derived here.** A 2D/3D Macro
bucket comes from ``engine.signal_quality._tf_grid`` — the module's own absolute-session
grid — because a second implementation of "which sessions are in bucket k" is exactly the
silent fork the archaeology (§4.2) names as the standing hazard. What this module adds is
the *stamping* rule the known-ts law needs, which the producers do not export:

===========  ==================================  ==========================================
grain        ``signal_ts``                        ``signal_known_ts``  (``known_basis``)
===========  ==================================  ==========================================
1D           the session itself                  the same session's close  (``daily_close``)
2D / 3D      the bucket's OPEN date (the §7       the bucket's LAST session that carried a
             public marker contract)              close  (``bucket_last_session_close``)
W-FRI        the completed weekly bar's Friday    the last actual session in that week
             label                                (``w_fri_completed_close``)
===========  ==================================  ==========================================

A 3D marker is therefore stamped with a ``known_ts`` up to two sessions AFTER its own
``signal_ts`` — that asymmetry is not a defect, it is the availability truth (Radar §3.1
records the same, with measured examples: NVDA ts 2026-01-21 -> known 01-23). Every
consumer of these events must key off ``signal_known_ts``.

The trailing bucket is **excluded** wherever it is still open: its close, and therefore
every oscillator on it, keeps moving until the bucket completes, so a fire read off it is
not knowable (``engine.us_early_turn._completed_bucket_mask`` records the measured ghost
re-dating this prevents). ``completed_mask`` implements that as a pure function of the
grid, so truncating the input frame and masking after the fact agree by construction.

The Terminal twin's ``resample("2B")`` bucketing lives in :mod:`..grey_dot`, not here —
it is part of that locked-spec port, not a house grid.

    A right-labelled resample (``W-FRI``, ``2W-FRI``, ``ME``) stamps each bucket with a

    the period — so using it as ``signal_ts`` would put the event's own date AFTER the
    close that made it knowable, which inverts the known-ts law. The fix is to carry the
    bucket's first and last ACTUAL sessions and let callers stamp
    ``signal_ts = open_session`` / ``signal_known_ts = known`` — the same "opens here,
    becomes final there" semantics the session-anchored 2D/3D grids already have.
