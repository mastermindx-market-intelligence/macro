"""Ticker-identity hygiene (masterplan §9.6) — run on every name before it is read.

A reused ticker splices a *different company's* history into one series "born
clean". The behavioral layer is the worst possible consumer of that: a fingerprint
computed across a splice describes an instrument that never existed, and an
episode catalog invents a decline where a corpse handed its symbol to a newborn.

Four repo sources are cross-checked, plus a first-print sanity read:

``config.yml quality.reused_ticker_acks``   symbols knowingly carrying a foreign
                                            prior holder's era in the same series
``config.yml quality.ticker_key_migrations`` rename pairs (old key -> new key): the
                                            SAME security continuing, which is
                                            instrument-level CONTINUITY, not a splice
``config.yml breadth.ticker_fixups``        the breadth-side rename map
``config/delisted_symbols.yml``             securities that stopped existing
``data/ipo/calendar.parquet``               first-print sanity vs the deal record

A rename and a reuse look identical in a bare price series and are opposite facts.
The rename keeps one instrument's identity; the reuse ends one and starts another.
This module never resolves one with the other's mechanism.

Historical/current split: sealed W1 receipts preserve the original finding and its
then-current ``unacknowledged`` wording. PR #5613 subsequently acknowledged and
ratified both recycled symbols. ``data/baskets/ohlcv/ABX.parquet`` is Abacus Global
Management's 2020-09-14-> tape and contains zero Barrick rows; ABX stays blocked only
to reproduce the sealed W1 compute population. ``GOLD.parquet`` is readable, continuous
Gold.com/A-Mark dealer history from 2014-03-17, but it is never Barrick/miner evidence.
Barrick Mining has traded as NYSE B since 2025-05-09, and PR #5632 seeded its curated
``data/baskets/ohlcv/B.parquet`` tape. Frozen W1 artifacts are not rewritten by these
current-code corrections.
