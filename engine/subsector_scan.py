"""Subsector radar — the bottleneck x revision signature over the FULL Finviz taxonomy
(research/THEMATIC_FORESIGHT_INSTITUTIONAL_UPGRADE.md §6; data/sp500_heatmap/industry_map.json).

WHY. The cascade runs over 18 hand-curated themes. The desk also has a practitioner-grade
classification of the whole S&P 500 — 503 names -> 11 sectors -> 113 sub-industries
(data/sp500_heatmap/industry_map.json, the Finviz heatmap source). These names have analyst
coverage (so T4 revision breadth is real) and EDGAR filings (so the scarcity-language read is
real), which makes them a clean, comprehensive universe to run the desk's core signature over.

This engine generalises the cascade from 18 themes to all 113 sub-industries: for each it rolls
up revision breadth (REUSING engine.theme_revisions.theme_revisions_for over the same
data/revisions store) and counts members reporting manufacturing-SPECIFIC scarcity language
(REUSING the market-wide sweep in data/edgar/emergence_hits.parquet), then applies the cascade
STAGE logic. It is the systematic-coverage complement to engine.theme_emergence (which finds
UNTRACKED small-cap clusters): this scans the KNOWN S&P 500 at sub-industry granularity so you
can see, market-wide, WHERE supply scarcity and estimate revisions are aligning.

HONEST. The bottleneck here is a TEXT-ONLY proxy (EDGAR scarcity language), not a FRED
physical confirmation — so a "PRECIPICE" on this radar is a screen to investigate, not a
confirmed thesis (it would carry the text-only score cap in the curated cascade). DISPLAY-ONLY,
forward-graded, None on shortfall.
