"""China Prophet loser + miss telemetry — OPS-TELEMETRY tier, **ZERO AUTHORITY**.

WHAT THIS IS
------------
A nightly read-only forensic pass over the board ledger that answers three questions the
board itself cannot answer about itself:

  1. **Which of our own picks lost, and did they share a shape?** Per matured episode
     it recomputes the "chase" shape — did we buy a name that had already gone (closed
     at its own high on a limit-move day, gapped away from us overnight, or arrived
     after a 21-session run) — and reports the loser/winner split inside that cohort
     against the cohort outside it.
  2. **Which real runners did we never surface, and where did they stop?** Rolling
     top-150 trailing-63-session runners are joined against the point-in-time candidate
     ledger, so a name we missed is attributed to the exact funnel stage that dropped
     it (``featured`` / ``more_actionable`` / ``late_or_unfillable`` / ``forming`` /
     ``not_raw_eligible`` / ``absent``) rather than to a vague "we missed it".
  3. **Is the SCORE ITSELF any good — on every dimension, not just the one that is
     easy to count?** ``rank_effectiveness`` grades the ordering nightly: a rank-IC
     ladder across every realized outcome the ledger carries, top-6 oracle regret per
     admission date, a risk/time profile per score tercile, and a per-component
     attribution. The multi-metric shape is deliberate and is the whole point (see
     §RANK EFFECTIVENESS below): a shortlist can be *right* in a way an immediate-win
     count cannot see.

WHAT THIS IS NOT — the authority boundary
-----------------------------------------
This module has **zero authority**. It never scores, ranks, gates, sizes, vetoes, or
orders anything. It writes to its own store (``data/cn_prophet_audit/``) and to nothing
else; no production artifact, template, or lane reads from it. Its outputs are
operator-facing telemetry for deciding what to *investigate*, and every number in them
is display-tier until it is separately promoted through the gauntlet (CLAUDE.md
§Epistemics: the gauntlet is a PROMOTION gate, never a build gate — a null here blocks
nothing and the accrual continues regardless).

CONVENTIONS THAT ARE LOAD-BEARING
---------------------------------
* **Never pooled across ``board_definition``.** The legacy cascade/setup board and the
  selective ``cn_prophet_v2`` shelf are different instruments; a union measures neither
  (the same law ``china_standout_track._latest_definition_frame`` enforces). Every
  aggregate in this module is keyed by definition and the definitions are never summed.
* **The ledger's own scorer.** Episodes come from ``track_scoring.build_episodes`` over
  ``{date → tickers}``; grading is the forced H=10 verdict via ``score_from_fill`` with
  the CN T+1 fill from ``china_standout_track._t1_fill`` (locked-limit rows excluded —
  unfillable is unfillable) and CSI300-relative excess off ``_bench_close``. Re-deriving
  a second scoring path here would produce a second, incomparable win rate.
* **PIT only for the miss funnel.** A name's funnel state on a session is the lane the
  candidate ledger *recorded that day*. ``gate()`` is never replayed and history is
  never backfilled — both are far too heavy for the asia lane, and a replayed gate is
  not point-in-time anyway. Coverage therefore starts at the candidate store's birth
  (2026-07-30) and ``coverage_start`` is printed in every artifact.
* **Write discipline.** Best-effort, never raises. Writes are gated FAIL-CLOSED to the asia
  collection lane (``lane == 'asia'`` writes; an unrecognised lane, or a caller that never
  named one, refuses) and refused on a mid-session partial panel via the SAME
  ``china_standout_track.session_status`` check ``append_board`` uses. The forward log
  is append-only, keep-first per ``(date, board_definition)``.

RANK EFFECTIVENESS — how the score grades itself
------------------------------------------------
A track record that counts only "did the pick go up within 10 sessions" will condemn a
ranker that is in fact doing its job on a dimension that record cannot see. A top-ranked
name can carry a shallower drawdown, a bigger 21/63-session excursion, or a slower
path to its high than a mid-ranked one, and a single immediate-win number scores all of
that as a miss. So the ordering is graded on EVERY outcome the ledger already carries,
and each is published whether it flatters the score or not:

  * **The rank-IC ladder** — Spearman IC of the ordering against ``excess`` at the forced
    H=10 verdict (the incumbent number), the MAE proxy (worst forward close vs the fill),
    the maturation spine's ``fwd_mfe_{5,10,21,63}``, the catastrophic flag (abs P&L
    ≤ −15%), the rotational CLEAN_LIFTOFF partition, and post-cushion breach.
  * **Top-6 oracle regret** — per admission date, what the top-6-by-score actually earned
    against what the best-6-in-hindsight from the SAME date's pool earned. This is the
    only number that asks "did we highlight the best of the shortlist we ourselves drew",
    which is a different question from "did the shortlist go up".
  * **Risk/time profile by score tercile** — loser rate, median excess, median MAE,
    catastrophic rate, CLEAN_LIFTOFF share, median 21-session MFE, and median day-of-max.
    "Maybe the top-ranked picks are lower-risk, or slower but bigger" stops being a
    speculation here and becomes a measured row.
  * **Per-component attribution** — each stored score leg gets its own IC, so which leg
    earns its weight is visible nightly rather than assumed (glass-box law).

ORIENTATION (stated once, because a sign error here inverts every reading)
    Every IC is emitted in ONE canonical orientation: the ordering key is built so that
    a LOWER key is the board's OWN claim of a better pick. ``board_rank`` is used as-is
    (rank 1 = best); ``prophet_score`` and every component are NEGATED (higher score =
    better pick). So for an outcome where higher is better — excess, MFE, CLEAN_LIFTOFF —
    a well-ordered board scores a NEGATIVE IC, and a POSITIVE IC is the V1 failure
    (measured legacy baseline: board_rank IC vs excess = **+0.073**, anti-predictive).
    For a COST outcome — catastrophic, post-cushion breach — the signs flip, so every
    metric ships its own ``good_sign`` and a ``wrong_sign`` boolean rather than leaving
    the reader to work it out. IC method is the per-date Spearman then the MEAN across
    dates, gated at 5 distinct ordering values per date — the same convention
    ``china_standout_track.grade`` publishes ``board_rank_ic`` with, and the one that
    reproduces the audited +0.073. The pooled cross-date IC ships alongside it.

BUDGET
------
Render budget is law. The whole pass is designed to stay well inside the ~90s allotted
to it on the asia lane: per-ticker price frames are memoised across every episode, the
runner universe is scanned with ``columns=['close']`` only, and no per-name recompute of
any production signal happens at all. ``rank_effectiveness`` adds NO store reads at all —
it is pure arithmetic over the episode records section 1 already built, and carries its
own ``elapsed_seconds``. Measured ``elapsed_seconds`` ships in the artifact so a
regression is visible the night it lands.
