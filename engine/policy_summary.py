"""Policy-layer scorecard — unify the layer's accountability data into one scannable
read, and surface the SHARPEST DIVERGENCE (a TARGETED theme the rotation map asserts is
policy-favored but that is actually lagging worst vs SPY).

Pure + defensive; never raises. Display-only synthesis of already-computed structures
(prediction counts, rotation realized-check, Fed-stance streak, intel dating)."""
