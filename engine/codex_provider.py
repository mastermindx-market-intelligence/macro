"""Anthropic-compatible adapter for the attached Codex subscription.

The site already standardizes model calls on ``client.messages.create`` and
``client.messages.stream``.  This module gives the existing provider waterfall
that same interface while executing an ephemeral, non-interactive Codex CLI
turn on hosts where a Codex login is already attached.

Security boundary
-----------------
Codex is deliberately reduced here: shell, web search and sub-agents are
disabled; the sandbox is read-only; user configuration and repository rules are
ignored; and the working directory is the system temp directory.  The credential
is never read by Python and never logged.

The ONE tool that can be enabled is ``view_image``, and only on a call that
carries image blocks (operator directive 2026-07-31 — chat vision runs on the
attached Codex subscription rather than metered Anthropic).  Such a call gets a
throwaway temp directory as its cwd, holding just the decoded attachments, and
that directory is deleted when the call returns.  Image URLs are never fetched
server-side; the model is told it cannot see them.

The provider auto-discovers either a trusted-automation environment credential
(``CODEX_ACCESS_TOKEN`` / ``CODEX_API_KEY``) or the attached login under
``CODEX_HOME`` (default ``~/.codex``).  Hosts without Codex and an attached
login simply omit this provider from the waterfall.
