"""engine/subsector_confluence.py — the MACDRSI×StochRSI confluence ENTRY gate + the
validated rotation state machine, run on a SYNTHETIC equal-weight member-average index
for every Finviz S&P-500 sub-industry (and the 11 sectors), then funnelled into a
DOUBLE-GATED stock watch list (stock buyable AND its subsector buyable).

WHY. The existing subsector surfaces are orthogonal lenses: `subsector_rotation` is an
RRG/relative-strength read off Finviz's own % snapshot, and `subsector_scan` is an
EDGAR-scarcity × revision STAGE — neither runs the owner's price confluence. The Standout
board (`build_stock_library` → us_standouts.json) gates SINGLE names with the validated
T1-T4 cascade but has NO subsector-condition gate, so a great stock in a sector institutions
are distributing ranks identically to one with a tailwind. This module closes that gap by
COMPOSING existing, validated machinery — it adds no new signal math:

  • engine.subsector_scan._industry_map  → 503 S&P names → 11 sectors → 113 sub-industries
    (data/sp500_heatmap/industry_map.json, the Finviz heatmap clone)
  • engine.basket_index.consolidated_candle(mode="equal", pit=False) → the equal-weight
    member-average LEVEL series — the "combined members' weighted-average performance" chart
  • engine.signal_gate.gate → the owner's T1-T4 MACDRSI×StochRSI cascade (the ENTRY tier:
    T1 just-crossed master, T2 2D-MACD cross & 3D-Stoch crossed, T3 about-to-cross, T4 earliest)
  • engine.sector_signals.sector_signal → the validated BUY/SETUP/EXTENDED/TOPPING/SELL
    regime state machine (the rotation CONTEXT — the strong, era-robust edge is the AVOID side)

THE DOUBLE GATE (the user's spec, made context-aware rather than a sparse strict-AND):
  A subsector is ENTRY-NOW when its basket gate is a fresh buyable tier (T1/T2/T3) — i.e. it
  "just got a signal in the last 1-2 3D ticks, or has the 3D StochRSI and is about to get a
  2D MACDRSI". A member stock is a DOUBLE-CONFLUENCE buy when its OWN gate is buyable AND its
  subsector is a tailwind (entry-now, or a BUY/SETUP regime). A member whose own gate fires
  but whose subsector is TOPPING/SELL is surfaced as a HEADWIND warning, NOT a buy — that is
  the validated "don't chase the leadership institutions are distributing into" edge.

HONEST BY CONSTRUCTION. Equal-weight (the scored baseline — cap weights are partial and add
look-ahead). Membership is TODAY's S&P 500 with no point-in-time add/remove history, so the
index is a DESCRIPTIVE consolidated tape (survivorship-tinted), NOT an out-of-sample backtest.
EOD daily only. 3D buckets are calendar-business-day (not TradingView's session-from-IPO
anchor — the same known offset that already applies to single names). The SPDR-calibrated
STATE_BASE_RATES are OUT OF DOMAIN here and are deliberately NOT surfaced as validated numbers.
Every read is point-in-time / leak-free (the underlying gates project from PAST bars only).
DISPLAY-ONLY entry-QUALITY / RISK — one door; confirm before acting. None/empty on shortfall.
