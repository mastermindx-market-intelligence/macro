"""engine/marker_integrity.py — the append-only marker law (Rotation Command RC-R2).

The bug this kills (masterplan §0.4, verified from committed renders): signal-marker
files are fully recomputed each night, so a marker the site already RENDERED can be
silently re-dated or deleted — site/subsector_signals/b-ai-software.json carried a
2026-07-06 buy in the 07-07 render that became 2026-07-09 in the 07-10 render, and a
software-application rebuy was re-graded take→block. A file that mutates its own history
is not a point-in-time record, so nothing built on it (ledgers, graders, the §7 chart)
is falsifiable.

THE LAW, applied at every marker write (one merge with the previously rendered file):

  • every previously rendered marker persists — original date, original type, forever;
  • a recomputed marker of the SAME type within TOL_DAYS of a rendered one is the SAME
    print → the rendered date wins (never re-dated), and only if the rendered marker is
    still inside FRESH_DAYS of the previous as-of may its quality/reason refine
    (pending→take/block is the designed confirmation flow); outside that window a
    relabel is blocked and counted;
  • a recomputed marker with no rendered counterpart is APPENDED if it is recent
    (inside FRESH_DAYS of the previous as-of — a genuinely new signal), DROPPED and
    counted if it lands deep in history (a recompute inventing the past);
  • a rendered marker the recompute no longer produces is RETAINED and counted;
  • the DERIVED date fields (`signal_date`, `confirmed_date` — functions of the marker's
    own `date` plus the grid, not independent facts) are BACKFILLED when the rendered
    marker carries no value, and a non-null rendered value is never overwritten. That is
    what lets a marker published mid-confirmation with `confirmed_date: null` name the
    date it cleared, without opening a channel that could re-date a shown marker. A
    `confirmed_date` is admitted atomically with a final take/block verdict: if an old
    pending marker is outside the refinement window, both stay frozen pending/null;
  • `recorded_at` — the run that FIRST published a marker — is sticky: a rendered marker
    keeps its stamp, and one rendered before the field existed discloses null rather than
    being back-stamped with tonight's run (see `merge_markers`).

All divergence is disclosed in the payload's `pit` dict (cumulative across nights) —
the merged file may drift from tonight's pure recompute, and that is the point: the
file is the record of what was shown, not of what tonight's data revision implies.

THE ONE EXCEPTION — AN ADJUDICATED ERA CHANGE (R-SQ7). The law above exists to stop
UNEXPLAINED nightly mutation. It cannot be allowed to absorb an EXPLAINED one: when the
marker engine's bucketing grid is deliberately re-anchored, every historical marker
legitimately re-dates at once. Under the same-era law that re-draw would be swallowed —
re-dated markers inside TOL_DAYS keep their old rendered date forever, re-phased ones
beyond it are DROPPED (`drift_deep_new`) or ghost-RETAINED (`drift_lost`) — so the
rendered chart would keep the OLD grid while every live `gate()` consumer (boards, the
HK/CN lanes) moved to the new one the same night: a permanent split-brain, plus a
one-time drift-counter burst burying real future drift. So `merge_payload` compares the
payload's `anchor_era`, and on a MISMATCH it yields exactly once — tonight's recompute
replaces the marker history WHOLESALE, `pit["era_cutover"]` records the crossing forever,
and the append-only law resumes under the new era on the next night. That is the same
doctrine as `regen_hk_g1_fixture --force`: an engine-change PR knows itself. Unexplained
re-datings stay blocked exactly as before.
