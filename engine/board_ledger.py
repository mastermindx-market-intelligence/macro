"""Standout-board forward ledger for HK and Canada stock pages.

Masterplan §5.4 + §0 'honesty spine'; audit HKCA-12; red-team product-critic FATAL 2.

W0 Stage B-c additions (§5.1 sub-task 4, §3.4 Asia-lane stamping, §1.1 spine):
  1. GRADE LOOP → grading.forward_metrics (one-grader law §1.2): grade() now calls
     grading.forward_metrics once per (ticker, date) for all 4 horizons instead of
     per-horizon grade_next_bar_return calls. Parity: forward_metrics is the same
     function grade_next_bar_return delegates to; max_abs_diff = 0.0 on all horizons
     and all existing rows. Suspension rule, excess-vs-market, and accruing-status
     gate are PRESERVED EXACTLY. grade() is keep-FRESH (re-grades every row each run
     from the live close store — not keep-FIRST). This contract is unchanged.
  2. SPINE COLUMNS (schema-union, nullable): fwd_mfe_{5,10,21,63}, fwd_mfe_63 (63d
     already in _HORIZONS_D), terminal_state_clean15_126, terminal_state_clean8_21,
     post_cushion_breach(horizon=21). Suspended rows: spine cols stay null (sacred
     rule). Legacy rows null-extended via schema union.
  3. ASIA/CA-LANE REGIME STAMPS (§3.4):
     (a) Own-market primary stamp: NULL + documented. Both HK regime_history.parquet
         and CA regime_history.parquet are RECOMPUTED each run from latest-state
         sources (engine/hk_run.py L44, engine/canada_run.py L83: store_df.to_parquet
         overwrite — not PIT append-only). The signal_archive/{hk,ca}_regime.parquet
         files are PIT but started only 2026-06-17 and have <12 rows each — not a
         reliable stamping source for a graded ledger. Therefore: own_market_regime=null
         on all rows; own_market_regime_note documents this constraint. A future
         initiative that persists a daily-append PIT file for HK/CA regime state can
         wire it here.
     (b) US context stamp (validated global-factors-drive-HK finding): us_rate_pressure,
         us_quad_hard_label, us_fused_risk_label, us_vol_regime, us_risk_radar_state,
         us_regime_vector_degraded from get_vector_for_date on the persisted US
         data/regime/regime_vector.parquet. Columns prefixed us_* to mark them as
         CONTEXT, not primary regime.
     (c) vector_asof + staleness_hours on every row (may be negative-or-zero when
         the US vector's asof is same-day as the HK/CA render).
     append_board stamps new rows; grade() backfills null stamps from the persisted
     vector only; residual unstamped count printed in scorecard output.
  4. SPECIES/ARCHETYPE: no species in data/species/registry.json binds to this ledger
     (checked: S1..DISLOC all bind to us_board_ledger / china_standout_track). Neither
     build_hk_library.py nor build_canada.py passes an 'archetype' key in the calls
     dict. Therefore: species_id=null, archetype=null on all rows (documented below).

Problem addressed
-----------------
The existing name_score_grader grades the per-name POTENTIAL score (primed / setting_up /
watch / no_setup). It does NOT grade the standout board rank — the order in which the page
actually surfaces names to the user. This module is the explicit standout-board scoreboard
the plan mandates: it logs the RANKED board each render, then grades it honestly.

Three public functions
----------------------
* append_board(calls, market, asof)  — log the ranked board at render time.
* grade(market)                      �� compute forward returns + IC for matured calls.
* scorecard(market)                  — per-group hit-rate + rank-IC; returns 'accruing'
                                       status dict until the min-IC-dates gate is met.

Honesty guarantees (enforced in code, not cadence)
---------------------------------------------------
1. NEXT-BAR fill: a call logged on asof is FILLED at the next available bar, never the
   signal bar itself (via engine.grading.forward_metrics — the one-grader law §1.2).
2. SUSPENSION rule (HK-native, red-team MISSING #5): if no valid print exists within
   5 sessions after the fill date, the call is marked 'suspended' and EXCLUDED from
   hit-rates. HK names suspend for weeks (deals, going-private, regulatory); silent
   ffill through halts fabricates returns. No silent-ffill ever.
   Suspension check runs BEFORE any grading; spine columns stay null for suspended rows.
3. Accruing-status gate: scorecard() returns {'status': 'accruing', ...} until
   ≥ MIN_IC_DATES matured dates each carry ≥ MIN_NAMES_PER_DATE names. This prevents
   early-alert fatigue in the admin experiments tracker.
4. Survivorship stamp: 'no_dead_name_store' is always set (no ex-HK/CA dead-name store
   exists — losses on delisted names that disappear from the close store are NOT graded
   and the count is stamped). This is the survivorship BOUND, not a caveat sticker.
5. Excess return: scorecard computes 21d excess vs market index
   (HK = _HSI, CA = _GSPTSE) — not raw return — so the IC is against market-relative
   performance.

Store
-----
data/board_ledger/{hk,ca}_board.parquet — small (one row per board-date × ticker),
append-only, keep-FIRST per (date, ticker), git-tracked (not R2: the table is tiny
and grows ~50-120 rows/day; even a full year is <50 KB per market).

Schema (one row per board snapshot entry)
-----------------------------------------

                         render. Log-and-grade only — never a rank input. None = not stamped
                         (caller predates the port or doesn't compute it).
extended      bool|None  CN-port stamp (§5.3): extension read in {stretched, parabolic}.
                         Log-and-grade only. None = not stamped.
placement_flag bool|None H-PLC risk-gate stamp (masterplan §3, W1c): dilutive

                         90d window at render (HK only). Flagged names are demoted off
                         the entry groups; the stamp lets the gate itself be graded.
                         None = not stamped (pre-W1c row, non-HK market, or the
                         placement store was degraded that render — distinct from

        because grade_next_bar_return is a thin alias for forward_metrics.
      * SPINE COLUMNS: fills fwd_mfe_{5,10,21,63}, terminal_state_clean15_126,
        terminal_state_clean8_21, post_cushion_breach back to the parquet.
        Suspended rows: spine cols stay null. Legacy rows: null on first mature run,
        schema-union means no data is lost.
      * REGIME BACKFILL: rows with all-null us_* stamp cols are backfilled from the
        persisted regime_vector.parquet. grade() only backfills null slots — it never
        overwrites a non-null stamp. The count of still-unstamped rows is reported in
        the return dict.

    For each logged call:
      1. Find the fill bar = NEXT bar after the call date (next-bar fill via grading).
      2. Check suspension BEFORE grading: if fewer than SUSPENSION_SESSIONS bars exist
         after fill, mark 'suspended' and exclude from IC and hit-rates. SACRED RULE.
      3. Compute forward returns via grading.forward_metrics (one grader, all horizons).
      4. Compute spine columns: fwd_mfe_{h}, terminal_state_*, post_cushion_breach.
      5. Excess return vs market index: excess = name_fwd_ret − bench_fwd_ret.
      6. Write updated spine + regime-stamp columns back to the parquet (keep-FRESH).

    packet PROPHET_HK_CANADA_REVAMP_EXECUTION_PACKET_2026_08_18.md §7).  When the
    ledger carries a stamped ``board_definition``, EVERY current-scope selection
    metric — ``rank_ic`` (fenced since 2026-08-03) AND, as of this change, ``n``,
    ``n_buy``, ``hit_rate_21d``, ``by_group`` — is computed ONLY over rows
    carrying that newest definition (the scoped/``ic_frame`` rows).  ``board_pos``
    AND ``group`` both live inside one selection instrument; HK's hk_prophet_v1
    buy-lane re-sort and Canada's ca_prophet_branch_b_v1 stamp each changed the
    instrument mid-ledger, so a hit rate or by-group breakdown pooled across the
    old and new instrument would misrepresent the CURRENT model's track record
    with the OLD model's calls — the same contamination the rank_ic fence was
    built to prevent, now closed for the group metrics too.  A ledger where
    nothing is stamped (every HK row written before the stamp existed, and any
    ledger that never adopts one) has ``definition`` None and pools exactly as
    it always did — see ``metrics_scope``.  Excluded legacy rows are NEVER
    dropped or restamped: they stay fully queryable, graded under the identical
    rules, inside the top-level ``historical_context`` block.  ``n`` and
    ``n_scoped`` now always agree (``n`` used to report the all-era row count
