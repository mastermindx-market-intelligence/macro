"""Prospective grader for Government Revenue research candidates — Wave 9G.

WHAT THIS IS FOR
----------------
The Government Revenue lobe can produce evidence-bound, receipt-backed,
well-argued candidates and still have **no predictive value**.  This module is
the instrument that is allowed to say so.  Every construction below is chosen so
that a null cannot be dressed up as a result, and so that the honest answer
"this family does not predict anything" is reachable from the data.

It grades ONE preregistered family at a time (``research/
GOVERNMENT_REVENUE_CANDIDATE_GRADER_PREREG.md``).  The family's horizons,
benchmarks, entry rule, hit definition, maturity gate, and kill condition are
frozen in that document BEFORE any observation exists, and a copy of the
horizons travels on every issuance row so a later edit to the document cannot
retro-change what a live cohort was promised.

AUTHORITY (unchanged, non-negotiable)
-------------------------------------
Output is ``display``/``context``.  This module cannot create, rank, size, or
gate anything, and an attractive interim number is not a promotion.  Promotion
requires the existing gauntlet and an operator ruling.  ``_authority()`` mirrors
``engine/government_revenue/candidates.py`` exactly.

THE STATISTICAL TRAPS THIS FILE IS BUILT AROUND
-----------------------------------------------
Each of these has actually shipped in this repository.  The structure that
prevents each one is named so a future edit cannot quietly remove it:

1. **Resolution-conditioned denominators delete losers.**  The cohort is
   enumerated from the issuance log at ISSUANCE (``cohort_rows``), never from
   the graded subset.  ``CohortOutcome.issued_n`` is fixed there.  The
   graded-conditioned ``hit_rate`` is emitted ONLY beside its ``coverage`` and
   beside ``hit_rate_bounds``, whose width IS the coverage penalty: the lower
   bound counts every ungraded row as a miss, the upper bound as a hit.  A
   retraction never removes a row from the denominator — you cannot retract your
   way out of a loss, only into a wider bound.
2. **An unresolved endpoint is not 0.5.**  There is no imputation path.  A row
   the grader cannot resolve is ``ungraded`` with a named reason and is excluded
   from BOTH the numerator and the denominator of the conditional rate.
3. **Median of a binary rate can flip sign versus the pooled rate.**
   ``monthly_and_pooled`` returns both or raises; the payload cannot carry a
   median of monthly rates without the pooled figure beside it.
4. **A cadence change makes an N-gate vacuous.**  Re-observing one event nightly
   must not manufacture cohort members: ``cohort_rows`` keeps the FIRST issuance
   per ``candidate_id``, and the maturity gate counts distinct source events,
   distinct issuers, and distinct event months — never row count alone.
5. **``resample("nB")`` start-anchors every bin.**  There is no pandas here and
   no business-day arithmetic.  Horizons are counted as INDEX STEPS along an
   explicit :class:`SessionCalendar` supplied by the caller, and a horizon whose
   exit index runs off the end of that calendar is ``ungraded``, never clamped.
6. **Price vintages move.**  The collection lane re-adjusts historical closes in
   place, so a grade computed today may not reproduce tomorrow.  Every grade row
   records the :class:`PriceBasis` it was computed against (field, adjustment,
   vintage id, vintage clock), a panel whose ADJUSTMENT differs from the
   registered family is refused outright, and :func:`regrade_diff` surfaces rows
   whose value moved under a new vintage instead of silently overwriting them.
7. **A track record built on incomplete history is an artifact.**  No rate can
   be emitted without its coverage: :class:`Rate` refuses construction without a
   :class:`Coverage`, and :func:`assert_rates_carry_coverage` walks the finished
   payload and fails closed on any bare ``*_rate`` value — and on every
   coverage-bearing SUMMARY (``*_summary``, ``*_mean``, ``*_bound``), because the
   kill-bearing statistic is a mean, not a rate, and a walker that only knows
   about rates is blind to the number the verdict actually reads.
8. **A point comparison at the gate floor is a coin flip.**  Every verdict input
   carries an SD, a standard error, and a bootstrap interval, and each verdict
   region requires the INTERVAL to clear its registered threshold.  The
   registered N is the N that threshold needs (§7 of the registration states the
   power calculation); an N chosen for convenience makes a preregistered kill
   fire on noise.
9. **You cannot ungrade your way out of a loss.**  A correction may not rewrite
   the fields that DEFINE the measurement (``known_at``, ``ticker``,
   ``horizons``, ``entry_rule``, the source event, the issuer), the reason must
   come from a closed vocabulary, and — the supersession ratchet — a grade a
   superseded row already earned is RETAINED for the verdict statistic when its
   superseding row cannot be graded.  Supersession may lower coverage; it may
   never delete a number.  Below the registered verdict coverage floor no
   verdict fires at all.
10. **A null endpoint is not a loss, and a degenerate interval is not an
   interval.**  ``NaN <= 0`` is ``False``, so every non-finite close sailed
   through the panel accessor: a NaN entry bar produced ``nan > 0 == False`` and
   graded as a **MISS** — trap 2 inverted, a null scored as a loss — while the
   report carried a bare ``NaN`` literal no strict JSON parser accepts.
   :meth:`PricePanel.close` now refuses non-finite values and
   :func:`_canonical_json` refuses to emit them.  Symmetrically,
   :func:`_bootstrap_mean_ci` returned a ZERO-WIDTH interval at ``n == 1``, and a
   zero-width interval passes every threshold test a point estimate passes —
   which is the exact comparison trap 8 exists to prevent, reintroduced as its
   own remedy.  ``n < 2`` now has no interval.

11. **A frozen id is not a frozen ruler.**  A row froze ``calendar_id``, and a
   vendor revision of that calendar keeps the same id, so a session inserted or
   removed inside an already-frozen window re-cut it bit-for-bit differently and
   :func:`regrade_diff` attributed the move to the price vintage — under an
   IDENTICAL vintage id.  ``entry_rule`` now freezes the session-list PREFIX
   digest, a revision grades ``ungraded(calendar_revised)``, and the diff carries
   a calendar axis and a deletion axis (a grade that simply vanished from a run
   produced no drift row at all).

12. **A guard in the constructor is not a guard on the record.**  The
   correction allowlist was enforced only in :func:`build_correction_row`.  A
   hand-built superseding row carrying the identical ``known_at`` rewrite passed
   every log-side gate and flipped a verdict.  The allowlist is now enforced
   where the record is: :func:`parse_issuance_log`,
   :func:`append_issuance_rows`, and :func:`cohort_rows`.

13. **A family name is not a measurement unit.**  ``admit`` gated on
   ``candidate_family == "award_obligation_change"`` with no rail restriction,
   and the candidate contract admits BOTH the action rail and the snapshot rail
   into that family.  A family registered as positive funded-ACTION acceleration
   would therefore have begun issuing on snapshot-derived cumulative-balance
   deltas — a different measurement unit pooled into one graded cohort.  The
   family is fenced to :data:`GRV_FA1_SOURCE_RAIL`; anything else is
   ``family_rail_mismatch``.

14. **An unmapped issuer is an abstention, not an exception.**  ``admit`` had no
   ticker check, so an issuer the recipient graph could not map was ADMITTED and
   then raised inside the row builder — batch-fatal on the first one, no
   abstention row, no printed null.  The reviewed graph in this repository
   carries unmapped issuers today.  ``mapping_missing`` is now emitted.

15. **Absence of data reads as absence of event.**  The disclosure labels
   (earnings windows and subsequent filings) would, in the natural
   implementation, return an empty list for an issuer no calendar covers — so
   every issuer with the WORST data would score as the cleanest window.
   :class:`DisclosureCalendar` therefore declares the tickers it covers, and
   ``none_in_window`` (looked, found nothing) is a different state from
   ``unavailable`` (could not look) that no code path merges.  The labels are
   computed AFTER :func:`evaluate_verdict` returns, so they cannot be a verdict
   input: §7.2's registered N is derived for the paired market-relative mean,
   and a decision rule that grew a term would leave that N wrong in the
   document.

THREE COVERAGES, NEVER ONE
--------------------------
The handoff is explicit that a lobe can have excellent identity coverage and no
predictive value.  ``identity`` (issuers with a reviewed exact mapping),
``event`` (eligible events the spine actually observed), and ``outcome``
(issuance rows the grader could resolve) are three separate
:class:`Coverage` objects with three separate keys, and an outcome rate may only
cite an ``outcome`` coverage.  There is deliberately no code path that fuses
them into one number.

REUSED IDIOMS (not a second scheme)
-----------------------------------
The canonical-JSON + ``sha256`` content-address shape is
``engine/government_revenue/candidates.py``'s (``_canonical_json`` / ``_digest``,
delivery clocks excluded from identity).  The append-only JSONL discipline —
LF-only, one canonical object per line, trailing newline, prior-prefix hash
binding — is ``scripts/build_government_revenue_candidates.py``'s candidate
ledger, and the receipt shape is its projection-state ledger receipt.  The entry
convention (fill strictly after the signal bar, forward-only windows) is
``engine/grading.py``'s.  Those modules are NOT imported: this one stays free of
``jsonschema``/``pandas`` so it can be graded in a minimal environment, and the
duplication is three helper functions, deliberately.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# disclosure labels — earnings windows and subsequent filings
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The handoff asks for "earnings-window and subsequent-filings outcome labels
# where available".  Those three words carry the whole design.
#
# WHAT THE LABEL IS FOR.  A graded horizon may span an earnings print or a
# subsequent periodic filing, and if it does, the return it produced is not
# cleanly attributable to the award action the family issued on.  The label
# records that fact so a reader can partition the cohort after the fact.  It is
# a CONTAMINATION marker, not an outcome and not a signal.
#
# WHY IT IS STRUCTURALLY OUTSIDE THE VERDICT.  §7.2 of the registration derives
# N = 545 from a power calculation over the paired market-relative mean.  Adding
# a term to the decision rule would invalidate that N while leaving the
# registered number in the document — the "registered N is the N the threshold
# needs" trap, inverted.  So the labels are computed AFTER ``evaluate_verdict``
# has already returned and are attached to the report beside the verdict, never
# inside its inputs.  ``build_cohort_report`` enforces the ordering and
# ``test_disclosure_labels_cannot_reach_the_verdict`` pins it by comparing the
# verdict block of a report built with a calendar against one built without.
#
# WHY "unavailable" AND "none_in_window" ARE DIFFERENT STATES.  This is the
# whole reason the class exists rather than a bare integer.  "We looked and no
# earnings fell in this window" is evidence.  "We have no earnings calendar for
# this issuer" is the absence of evidence.  Collapsing them — the natural
# implementation, a ``defaultdict(list)`` returning ``[]`` for an unknown ticker
# — silently converts every uncovered issuer into a clean, contamination-free
# row and flatters the cohort exactly where coverage is worst.  A calendar
# therefore declares the tickers it COVERS, and a ticker outside that set is
# ``unavailable`` with a named reason, never ``none_in_window``.

#: Kinds of disclosure a window may span.  ``filing`` is the "subsequent
#: filings" half of the handoff line: a periodic or current report published
#: after issuance and inside the frozen window.
DISCLOSURE_KINDS = ("earnings", "filing")

#: A label is either computed (and then says what it found) or it is not
#: computed (and then says why).  There is no fourth state and no default.
DISCLOSURE_LABEL_STATES = ("observed", "none_in_window", "unavailable")

#: Every reason a disclosure label may be absent.  Mirrors ``UNGRADED_REASONS``
#: in spirit: a row is never silently dropped from the label census, so the
#: three counts always sum to the cohort.

class DisclosureEvent:
    """One earnings print or filing, with its OWN availability clock.

    ``known_at`` is when this pipeline could first know the disclosure happened,
    and it is a separate clock from ``event_date``.  Filing indexes are
    published on a lag, so a label computed from an event whose ``known_at`` is
    in the FUTURE relative to the report would be reading tomorrow's index.

    Stated exactly, because the looser phrasing oversold it: the clamp is
    ``known_at <= as_of``, the REPORT's clock — not the graded window's exit.  A
    disclosure whose date fell inside a window closed months ago, but which this
    pipeline only learned about last night, DOES label that window.  That is
    deliberate and registered (§11): the label is a descriptive contamination
    marker computed after the verdict, so knowing more later can only describe
    the past better, and it can reach no decision.  It is therefore NOT the same
    clamp ``grade_row`` applies on the price side — that one is bounded by the
    row's own window, because a price outside the window changes the measured
    number.  Conflating the two invites a future edit to "fix" a clamp that is
    doing what §11 registered.

    A kill condition no code path can emit is a detector with an unsatisfiable

    SUPPORTED condition no plausible signal can reach — the prior rule required
    ``hits/issued > 0.50`` over the FIXED cohort, which at the registered 0.70
    coverage floor demanded a conditional h63 hit rate above 71.4%.  Both
    branches must be reachable or the instrument only has one answer.

    Three exhaustive regions, each testing an INTERVAL against a registered
    threshold rather than comparing a point estimate to zero:

    * **KILL** — the interval rules the minimum interesting effect OUT, both
      absolutely and against the family's own placebo.
    * **SUPPORTED** — the interval rules it IN, and the hit rate clears its
      floor with its own interval.
    * **TESTED-NULL** — everything else: measured, and neither ruled out nor
      supported at the registered power.  There is no fall-through region with a
      label that contradicts its own numbers.

    Two protections against optional stopping and post-hoc ungrading:
    ``latched_verdict`` implements §7's "evaluate H1 ONCE" (a decided verdict is
    reported forever, with any later recomputation printed beside it, never in
    place of it), and the verdict refuses to fire at all when the verdict-basis
    coverage is below the registered floor.

    And two more, added when an audit showed the registered N was not actually
    protecting either half of the decision rule (§7.6):

    * **The paired placebo delta carries the same coverage floor.** The basis
      coverage check reads the real side only; the paired intersection is a
      different and strictly smaller set, and it had no floor at all.
    * **The verdict is gated on INDEPENDENT DRAWS.** §7.2's N is a power
      calculation; ``window_independence`` already computed the honest
      non-overlapping estimate and nothing consulted it, so an interval narrowed
      by window overlap could clear a threshold the same evidence fails at its
      honest N.

    It decides nothing.  The state is display context for an operator ruling and
    confers no authority in any branch, including ``supported``.
