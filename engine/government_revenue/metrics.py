"""Deterministic Government Revenue Foresight context payload.

This module intentionally has no predictive or portfolio authority.  It turns official
USAspending observations into auditable company context: lag-aware obligation velocity,
contract funding/backlog arithmetic when ceiling fields exist, modification activity,
concentration, and date-rule recompete candidates.  The output is shaped as one member of
the reusable Vertical Intelligence Workbench family.

Point-in-time contract
----------------------
``effective_at`` is when the government record says an event occurred. ``known_at`` is
when this repository first observed it.  Optional action/snapshot ledgers are filtered on
both clocks for historical ``as_of`` requests.  The legacy monthly obligations frame has
only a collection-level ``known_at`` in ``data/usaspending/_meta.json``; the payload says
so explicitly and never claims that frame is historically replayable before that stamp.
