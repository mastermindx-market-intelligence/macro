"""Falsifiable forward TRACK-RECORD for the Subsector Rotation read — measure, don't assert.

The rotation engine ranks 268 subsectors by ``emerging_score`` and labels each
emerging / fading / neutral. Those are CLAIMS about the future. This harness
records them daily and, once a horizon elapses, grades them against realized
forward returns — so the page can show whether the read has ANY edge, and so an
unproven signal is flagged rather than trusted.

Structure mirrors engine.hub_track_record (Pattern B) with one real change: a
subsector has no price series, so its forward return is the **equal-weight mean
forward return of its FROZEN member tickers**, SPY-relative. Members are frozen
at snapshot time (no survivorship drift); only members we actually hold prices
for are used, and a subsector with too few priceable members is left unscored.

  1. snapshot(subsectors, member_map, today) — append today's per-subsector
     {date, key, score, stage, lean, members} to data/subsector_rotation/
     snapshots.jsonl. Idempotent by (date, key), where `date` is the NYSE SESSION
     the read describes, never the calendar day of the run (_session_stamp) —
     the nightly fires seven nights a week against an EOD board, so a weekend
     stamp would slip a re-description of Friday past that idempotency.
  2. compute(today) — for each horizon (5/10/21/63d) mature the snapshots old
     enough AND price-covered, compute member-EW SPY-relative forward returns,
     then: by-stage hit-rate (do 'emerging' subsectors outperform & 'fading'
     underperform?) + cross-sectional emerging_score IC (Newey-West HAC t) + an
     ERROR LEDGER of recently falsified calls.
  3. "proven" only with enough matured obs AND a significant positive HAC-t AND a graded
     span covering >= 6 non-overlapping horizon-length windows (_MIN_INDEP_WINDOWS). The
     window floor is the one that bites: matured rows count a 268-name cross-section, so a
     single date clears the row bar while buying no independent evidence at all.

CONTEXT-ONLY · DEGRADE-NEVER-RAISE — no matured data ⇒ a valid 'accruing'
payload, never an exception. Nothing here sizes a position.

# The note is the only sentence from this ledger a reader actually sees (it renders through
# scripts/build_subsector_rotation.py -> site/marketdata/subsector_rotation.json ->
# templates/subsector_rotation.js -> sector_central.html). Exactly ONE of these strings
# claims significance, and it is reachable from exactly one verdict.
#
# The strings live in a table rather than inline in compute() so `note_violation` can audit a
# STORED payload against them — the claim gate (scripts/check_validated_claims.py) cannot see
# this sentence at all: it never uses the word "validated", and it reaches the page through a
# runtime fetch of a 758 KB single-line JSON that no SCAN_GLOB covers (and whose
# `"verdict": "validated"` field is a _STRUCTURAL skip by design). The 2026-08-03 audit found
# the significance claim shipped for weeks with nothing able to fail because of it.
