"""Hong Kong IPO backdrop — DISPLAY-ONLY, NEVER-SCORED (Phase 3).

The US-vs-HK story (research/IPO_RADAR.md): HK is structurally MORE retail-tradeable
than the US — a mandatory public-offer tranche with a clawback, a published
over-subscription multiple, and a grey market (暗盘) that trades the night before
listing. The cruel irony is that the keyless data for those PRIMARY-market signals is
currently broken/blocked (akshare's HK IPO endpoint returns A-share data; the grey
market is broker-proprietary). So we cannot show the HK deal-level demand.

What we CAN show, keylessly, is the LIQUIDITY BACKDROP that drives HK's hot windows:
  southbound Stock Connect flow   mainland capital into HK (the 2025 boom's fuel)
  HIBOR (1-month)                 the cost of margin-financing IPO subscriptions
  HKD peg state                   strong-side (inflow) vs weak-side (outflow) pressure
  HK global risk state            risk-on/off receptiveness (engine/hk regime)

This is the backdrop, NOT a deal signal, and it is never scored. Reuses the existing
HK collectors; degrades gracefully (available=False) when the HK build hasn't run.
