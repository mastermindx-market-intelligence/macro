"""Deterministic "what changed since your last visit" spine (Watchlist+Portfolio W6).

The retention layer's engine half. Two pure functions and one section composer:

    snapshot_state(ctx, tickers)        -> portfolio_state_digest.v1
    diff_snapshots(previous, current)   -> [change, ...]
    compose_since_section(previous, current) -> brief section | None

**What a snapshot is.** A compact projection of the DESK's public state (stage number,
entry read, sector board class, earnings window, daily regime label) restricted to a
list of tickers. It is the smallest thing a client can keep between visits that still
lets us say what moved. It is a display artifact, not a record of the user.

**TWO-ORGANISMS LAW — the reason this module looks the way it does.** A snapshot carries
tickers and desk state and NOTHING ELSE: no shares, no cost basis, no entry price, no
weights, no account id, no timestamps of the user's own activity. That is not an
oversight to be "improved" later — it is the boundary. Consequences, all deliberate:

  * The user's holdings never enter a signal, score, or artifact write path. This module
    READS ctx and returns strings; it writes nothing, anywhere.
  * No snapshot is ever persisted to `data/` or to any repo artifact. Per-user state is
    the client's (or Supabase under owner-scoped RLS) — never this repo's.
  * Nothing here is loggable. Callers must not log a snapshot: even without money
    fields, the ticker set is the user's book. The composed CHANGE LINES are equally
    off-limits to logs (they name holdings).

**Descriptive, never prescriptive.** Change lines report transitions in the desk's own
vocabulary, copied verbatim (`entry.label`, `entry.state`, sector `class`,
`conviction_en`, regime `label_en`). No imperatives, no targets, no advice — the lines
pass the ask_brain advice filter by construction, and the zh strings avoid the
directional kill-list (买入/卖出/加仓/减仓/建仓/平仓 — RUL-NW4) by using neutral
transition verbs. Asserted in tests.

**Falsifier/refutation vocabulary is absent by construction** (operator 2026-07-27):
these are "what changed" lines, never "the thesis was refuted".

Determinism: pure dict/list math, no I/O, no clock reads. Same inputs → identical
output; names are iterated in sorted order so a dict's insertion order cannot leak into
the rendered sequence.
