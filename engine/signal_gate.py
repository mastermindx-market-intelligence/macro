"""Validated-confluence BUY GATE for the per-country Standout grids (US/CN/HK/CA/Intl).

Wraps :func:`engine.signal_quality.analyze` — the VALIDATED MACD-RSI x StochRSI confluence
buy-filter (reclaim-and-hold + bearish-div veto + 200MA bar-raiser; cut avg max drawdown
-23.7% -> -15.5% across 110 held-out US names; CHARTER.md §2/§5) — and turns its §7 marker
stream into a single grid ELIGIBILITY verdict so every country's "Standout Top Stocks" board
gates on the SAME validated signal that the chart renders.

This REPLACES the per-grid ad-hoc screens (the US standard-MACD(12,26,9)+StochRSI `cycles`
ladder; the non-US alpha-only floors) as the PRIMARY buy-entry gate. It is a DISPLAY-ONLY
entry-QUALITY / RISK gate, NOT alpha and NOT an auto-trade trigger (CHARTER §2).

Tiers (ranked; take is always above every anticipation — CHARTER §2/§7):

  TIER take          currently holding a buy-filter-ENDORSED entry: the last §7 marker is a
                     buy/rebuy with quality 'take' and no sell/cut has fired since. This is
                     the validated primary buy signal.
  TIER anticipation  imminently forming but NOT yet endorsed — surfaced as an *eligibility
                     exception*, never as a stronger buy than a take:
                       sub 'pending' = the confluence buy fired on the last 1-2 bars but its
                                       forward reclaim-and-hold confirmation isn't in yet
                                       (resolves to take/block next build; §7 'pending').
                       sub 'early'   = the validated 2D-MACD pre-cross advance-warning
                                       (early_now / m2d_s3d_early). Acting on it early is
                                       empirically WORSE entry quality (CONFLUENCE_TUNING.md
                                       §3), so it only makes a name ELIGIBLE to surface — it
                                       is never a take and never fed to conviction/auto-trade.
  not eligible       blocked buy, flat (last marker is a sell/cut), no buy signal,
                     insufficient history (analyze() returned None -> graceful skip), or
                     ENGINE ERROR (analyze() RAISED -> graceful skip, separately labelled).
                     The last two are both refusals but not the same claim, and they are
                     deliberately not interchangeable: one is a fact about the tape, the
                     other is a fact about this run. See gate().

signal_quality is CLOSE-ONLY by construction (it stochs the RSI of close; it never needs
high/low), so this gate runs on every market's close-only price store and self-degrades to
"insufficient history" on thin names instead of crashing. A name whose analyze() RAISES
degrades too — the gate still never crashes — but it degrades to "engine error", so a
broken input can never be read as a market fact about the name.

REASONS vs REASON. Every verdict carries BOTH `reason` (the single first-match label, unchanged
and back-compatible) and `reasons` (the ordered, exhaustive account, `reasons[0] == reason`
always). They differ only where a verdict is over-determined — today, a buy that more than one
buy-filter leg refuses. `reason` alone is a first-match LABEL: the bearish-divergence veto returns
before reclaim-and-hold is ever tested, so a name blocked twice reads as blocked once, and 77% of
divergence-vetoed CN fires were blocked by another leg anyway
(research/cn_prophet_audit/CN_DIVERGENCE_VETO_AUDIT.md). Neither field is a gate input — admission,
tier and eligibility are byte-identical with or without the account.

Anticipation-form decision: research/signal_engine/tuning_anticipation.py compared the
in-engine from-OS `early` leg (a) against a from-above-OS + 2D-cross relaxation (b) as
SURFACERS of imminent base3d buys on the 110 held-out US names. (a) dominated (b) on recall
(38.5% vs 21.9% of TAKEs), precision (32% vs 20.5%) and lead (4.6d vs 2.2d), so the gate uses
(a) = `early_now`; (b) was NOT adopted (it added mostly false alarms). See GRID_GATE.md.

    Strict tier-first buries the earlier tiers whenever confirmed masters outnumber the board
    cap (US/CN). The owner asked for a WEIGHTED blend instead: a name's board score is its
    base-score PERCENTILE within the pool, lifted by 0.5 and SCALED by the cascade weight
    (T1 1.0 .. T4 0.4) -- so masters still dominate, but a strong-conviction T2/T3 outranks a
    weak master and surfaces. Percentile-based ⇒ robust to the per-market base scale
    (US/HK composite_z, CN/CA alpha/setup). `base_of(x)`->market rank score; `verdict_of(x)`->
    the signal_gate verdict (for .weight). Ineligible / weightless names sink (score 0).

    `bonus_of(x)` (optional) -> an ADDITIVE per-row lift on the 0..1 blend scale (e.g. the China
    2W-StochRSI washout-reclaim bonus, or a NEGATIVE anti-chase extension penalty). It is added on
    top of the tier×conviction blend, so a bonus of ~one TIER_FRAC lifts a row by roughly a full
    tier WHILE the cascade tier still orders rows that share the same bonus. Default None = no lift.

    `tier_frac` overrides the module TIER_FRAC (how much the tier vs conviction drives the blend);
    `wn_floor` COMPRESSES the tier weight toward parity — the normalised tier weight wn (T1→1 ..
    T4→0) is remapped to [wn_floor, 1], so wn_floor=0.6 means T4 still gets 60% of T1's tier credit.
    Both default to the US behaviour (unchanged callers). CHINA passes a lower tier_frac + a wn_floor
    so a FRESH T2/T3 competes with a fresh — but often already-extended — T1 (medium-term A-share
    momentum is dead; a confirmed breakout is frequently already run). Anti-chase is handled
