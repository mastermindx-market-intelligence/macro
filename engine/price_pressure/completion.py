"""engine.price_pressure.completion — the §10.1 VIXCLS stamp-completion pass.

Registered contract: ``research/PRICE_PRESSURE_R4_VIX_GRADIENT_PREREG.md`` §3
("Lag completion (§10.1)") and §10 item 1.  The problem it exists for, in the
prereg's own measurement: the VIXCLS store trails the tape by one session at
the 22:30Z harvest (store last observation 2026-08-06 while 2026-08-07 had
already traded), so a forward row typically stamps ``vix_pctile = NULL``
through no property of its own — and under the exclusion rule that preceded
this amendment **both evidence arms would have starved to zero permanently**,
an ungradeable registration by construction.

The repair, implemented here literally:

* a **non-null** stamp is immutable and decides the arm forever — this pass
  never touches one, and never recomputes one;
* a **null-at-harvest** stamp is completed ONCE, null → t0's own close
  percentile under the shipped §3 transform (``context.vix_percentile_of`` on
  ``context.clean_vix_closes`` — the same construction the harvest ranks, not a
  re-typed copy), an exact late-arriving value and never a forward-fill;
* only by the first subsequent **nightly producer** run on which t0 is present
  in the store, and only while that row's ``fwd5`` endpoint is still immature.
  Grading-time code may consume the receipt but is forbidden to complete a
  stamp itself;
* only for ``era == "forward"`` rows dated on/after the registered 2026-08-11
  evidence boundary; gap/backfill rows and the 2026-08-10 forward slice remain
  frozen and can never enter the exception;
* the completing producer appends an immutable receipt binding row identity,
  the completed value, ``observed_at``, and the exact SHA-256 of the VIXCLS
  file bytes the value was computed from;
* a row that misses its window is **left null forever** — counted and logged,
  never repaired.

Two structural properties worth stating because they are the whole safety case:

**Receipts are appended only after the ledger write succeeds.**  ``run`` writes
nothing; it returns the completed frame and the receipts it would file, and the
caller (``pipeline.advance``) appends them only once ``write_ledger`` reports
``written``.  A receipt filed against a write that was skipped — the off-nightly
lane, say — would fence the row out of its own completion window forever, which
is the one way this pass could permanently destroy evidence.

**The pass is O(rows with a null stamp).**  It scans one boolean column and then
loops only the nulls; a 35k-row ledger with three null stamps does three
lookups, not 35,000.
