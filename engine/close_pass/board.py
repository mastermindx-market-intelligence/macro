"""engine.close_pass.board — the provisional board payload, from closes alone.

WHAT THIS COMPUTES, AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO
==========================================
Membership and ordering are different questions with different answers here, and
conflating them is the whole trap this module is shaped around.

MEMBERSHIP is exact. ``engine.signal_gate.gate()`` takes one data argument — a
daily close series — and everything it calls stays inside that: ``analyze()`` is
close-only by construction (``signal_gate`` docstring: it stochs the RSI of
close and never needs high/low) and ``confluence_tiers.cascade()``'s only
positional data argument is the same series (``market`` is a static suffix
label, ``event_latch`` an in-memory cache over the same history). No FINRA, no
open interest, no fundamentals, no SUE, no insider, no 13F, no LLM. So "who
would tonight's gate admit" is answerable at 16:20 ET and the answer is the real
one, not an approximation.

ORDERING is PARTIAL, and the masterplan's premise that it is not was measured
false. Of ``us_board_rank.SCORE_WEIGHTS``' five legs, exactly two are computable
from closes alone:

  signal  30  verdict.tier_cascade / provisional / ticks — all written by
              gate() above.                                        CLOSE-ONLY
  runway  10  row.ext_z / antichase_shadow_blocked — engine.extension reads a
              close matrix and nothing else.                       CLOSE-ONLY
  entry   25  entry.status ← engine.cycles.ladder_state(), which formally takes
              a net-liquidity regime, a macro risk score, THIS NAME'S SECTOR
              BETA and a vol regime; cycle_state() also takes `high`.  OMITTED
  edge    25  row.alpha ← engine.residual_alpha, which is sector-NEUTRALISED by
              construction: it needs a GICS label per name and a full-universe
              cross-section, not one name's history.                OMITTED
  quality 10  row.coiled{star,coiled} ← coiled.cohort_fractions(), a
              sector-cohort percentile. (washout_ctx alone IS close-only; the
              star/coiled verdict that scores 1.0/0.8 is not.)      OMITTED

Those three are OMITTED AND DISCLOSED — never imputed, never back-filled from
last night's artifact, and the weights are NOT renormalised over the surviving
legs. Renormalising would silently redefine what a point means and produce a
number that looks like the nightly's score and is not it; the payload carries
``weight_covered: 40`` and the reader of the payload is told which 60 points are
missing and why. A provisional order over 40 points of evidence, honestly
labelled, is worth more than a fabricated 100.

None of the omitted inputs is a FINRA / OI / fundamental figure — every one of
those is already in ``us_board_rank.ZERO_SCORE_AUTHORITY`` at zero weight. What
the omitted legs actually need is a sector classification and a macro regime
read. That is a weaker claim than "the score legs are 100% price-derived" and a
stronger one than "the board needs alternative data", and it is the true one.

WHY THE FUNCTIONS ARE IMPORTED, NEVER REIMPLEMENTED
Both surviving legs are scored by calling ``us_board_rank``'s own
``signal_value`` / ``runway_value``. A local copy would be a second definition
of the board's scoring language that drifts the first time either is re-tuned —
and ``signal_value``'s docstring documents a deliberately frozen non-monotone
shape that a reimplementation would "fix" and thereby disagree.

    Returns None rather than a partial dict: a row that cannot fill
    `CARD_REQUIRED` is dropped from the projection by `board_state`, which is
    what keeps `card_complete: true` an honest claim about every row that ships
    (W-L1d gate 3). Every `CARD_FIELDS` key is always PRESENT so the shape does
    not vary row to row; the optional ones may be null.

    `edge` IS NEVER EMITTED, and no 100-scale number appears here at all. The
    board's edge leg is sector-neutralised and this pass cannot compute it
    (OMITTED_LEGS); `points` is a figure on the real 100-point weights of which
    this pass covers 40, so publishing it beside a card would read as the
    nightly's score and would not be it. The client gets the two legs that ARE
    computed, on their own [0,1] scale, and derives its own words from them.

    `runway` may be NULL — meaning no extension reading existed, which the
    client renders as "not checked" rather than as thin room. `close_legs` owns
    that distinction and explains why it is not `0.0`.

    `spark` SHIPS NULL, AND THE REASON IS THE POLL, NOT THE PIXEL (ruling
    2026-08-09). Measured at the real board width of 131 rows, the `board_state`
    key is 37,757 B raw / 6,351 B gzip without sparklines and 265,173 B /
    39,142 B with them: ~1,700 B of SVG per card against ~281 B for all twelve
    other fields combined, so charts are 86% of the payload. That payload rides
    an artifact the dashboard polls every 120 s to detect a key that changes
    ONCE A DAY — ~1.16 MB/hour/reader to notice a daily event. And the evening
    chart is the weakest card element, not the strongest: its buy-zone band
    derives from the omitted `entry` leg, so it renders bandless. Paying 86% of
    the payload for a visibly degraded copy of the morning chart inverts the
    cost/benefit.

    IF CHARTS ARE EVER WANTED HERE, THE ANSWER IS NOT A TOP-N CAP. It is a
    separate one-shot artifact fetched only when the stamp qualifies: 265 KB
    once beats 39 KB × 30/hour for any session over ~15 minutes. A new `/live/*`
    file inherits the `@reg_asset` paywall automatically, but it needs VPS
    mirror work, so it is its own PR rather than a rider on this one. It also
    preserves "one artifact, one poll, one client" — a conditional one-shot
    fetch is not a second poll.
