"""Unified per-stock **Conviction Profile** — one engine, four markets.

This is the cross-market home of the "Standout individual stocks" verdict. It does
NOT invent a new statistical edge; it is a TRANSPARENT DECOMPOSITION of the legs we
already compute (validated and context alike), composed *around* — never replacing —
the calibrated ``engine/cycles.analyze`` ladder. The honest product is a *profile*
(four sub-axes you can read), not a single precise number.

Design contract (see ``research/STOCK_CONVICTION_DESIGN.md`` v2):

* **Four axes**, each a signed z built from ALREADY cross-sectionally standardized
  legs (so this module never re-standardizes — that is the panel builder's job):
    - ``selection``  — "will it go higher": the market's validated selection leg
      (US/CA residual alpha · CN reversal context · HK relative-strength screen).
    - ``entry``      — "how good is the entry": cycle entry/urgency + pullback vs
      extended + drawdown-from-high + RSI + an extension PENALTY (parabolic only).
    - ``tailwind``   — "how much higher": host-sector RS + thematic-basket strength
      (a declared sector-level TILT, small weight, never blended as within-sector).
    - ``quality``    — "how good is the business": SUE + insider (validated) and the
      orthogonalized factor composite + ex-US fundamental priors (context), CAPPED
      by the accounting-quality verdict.

* **The cycle state is a HARD VERB MODIFIER, not a side note.** A name in a
  downtrend/exit/avoid (or a parabolic blow-off) has its entry axis capped and can
  NEVER read "Buy/Add" — the headline verb says "strong name, wrong tape" instead.
  This is what actually kills the dashboard-vs-detail mismatch.

* **Honesty gates.** The 0-100 ``score`` is a DISPLAY skin (within-market percentile
  or a logistic), never a probability and never compared across markets as if equal.
  A per-market ``trust_tier`` states what the number means (US/CA weak-context · CN
  reversal-validated · HK no-edge screen). The SHIPPED board rank stays each market's
  validated leg unless a deep-CI Phase-0 persists ``gate: GO`` — this module's
  composite is display/ordering context by default.

Everything here is pure (per-name funcs are pure-python; the panel helper uses
pandas) so it is trivially unit-testable and reused by every ``build_*_library``.

# SUE's cross-sectional edge to ~0 (IC .039->.0006, HAC t 2.85->0.06, fails BH-FDR). The lone
# (borderline) cross-sectional FDR survivor is now insider net-buying (q~0.10, mid-cap habitat
# — a confirmer, not a standalone sizer; engine/signal_lab.py, factors.html), so insider LEADS
# the blend. SUE is kept as a per-name PEAD CONFLUENCE leg, not the dominant anchor: the deep
# collapse is cross-sectional + survivorship-biased (an optimistic bound), and PEAD as a
# per-name event effect can persist where the rank-IC is thin — but it no longer outweighs the
# leg that actually survives FDR. Revision is literature-strong; residual momentum is light,
# regime-scaled context. None is a standalone alpha -> this is a DISPLAY/confluence composite,
# never a validated sizer. Renormalized over whichever legs are present per name.
# v2.2 (de-anchored from the AVGO/NVDA two-name calibration): the prior v2.1 reweight set SUE 0.18
# / revision 0.32 by rebuilding until two NAMED tickers cleared a target band — a single-name fit.
# Re-derived here from the IC EVIDENCE ALONE: SUE's cross-sectional edge is ~ZERO on deep PIT
# history (reports/sue-deep-history-phase0.md, IC .039->.0005, HAC t 0.06, L/S Sharpe ~0) and the
# repo's own verdict DEMOTES SUE scored->display/confirmer. So SUE drops to a light CONFIRMER FLOOR
# (0.10, not scored alpha), and the freed weight goes to INSIDER (the lone borderline FDR survivor),
# which takes the clear top weight (0.50). Analyst REVISIONS stay a strong co-lead at their prior
# level (0.30 — deliberately NOT raised, since raising them would just re-boost the same two names);

# momentum's forward edge is STRONGLY regime-switching — sector-neutral rank-IC +0.030 in a
# calm/risk-on tape (SPY>200dma & low realized-vol) but -0.028 in a down tape and -0.017 in
# high-vol — while the SUE event edge is regime-ROBUST (+0.002..+0.006 everywhere). Switching
# momentum→SUE by regime lifts overall IC 0.0098→0.0192 and the long-only top-decile to
# 15.4% ann / Sortino 1.01 / maxDD -35% (vs SPY 13.4% / -47%). This is literature-grounded,
# not data-mined: Daniel-Moskowitz (2016) "Momentum Crashes" show momentum suffers severe
# crashes in panic/bear states and that scaling exposure by bear-state + variance ~doubles
# its Sharpe. So we scale ONLY the momentum (context) leg by the live `calm` score in [0,1]:
# near 0 in stress (momentum ~pulled out, SUE/insider dominate), up to _MOM_W_CALM in calm.
# `calm=None` (no live regime, ex-US, unit tests) keeps the v2 base weight -> behaviour
# unchanged. The validated SUE/insider/revision core is NEVER scaled down.

# PEAD freshness — DISPLAY-ONLY (the decay was retired; see below). SUE earnings drift fades
# over ~60-90d, so v3 weighted the SUE leg by exp(-days_since_filing / 45). That helped on the
# SYNTHETIC asof (period_end+60d), but once collectors/edgar_eps.py supplied the REAL filing
# date (~26d earlier, per-name staggered) the re-validation (scripts/pead_freshness_phase0.py,
# deep+PIT, τ swept 45/63/90) was decisive: the decay raises cross-sectional IC at every τ
# (0.0079->0.009+) but CONSISTENTLY LOWERS the long-only top-decile (13.6% flat -> 12.7-12.9%
# decayed, Sharpe .80 -> .73-.75) — recency-bias contaminates the extreme top decile (the names
# the board actually shows) with noisy just-reported surprises. The robust win is the REAL DATES
# improving the FLAT SUE's PIT (IC 0.0065->0.0079, long-only 13.3->13.6%, maxDD -38.1->-36.0%).
# So we score FLAT SUE and surface freshness (sue_fresh_days) as DISPLAY context only — never a
# score weight. (Kept honest per the no-overfit discipline: the better data overrode the
