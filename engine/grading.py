"""One honest grader for every US-side track record — the W1c "grading rebuild".

Audit #15/#46 (research/ENGINE_PROBLEM_AUDIT.md): the suite's proof-of-edge
artifacts were graded on the CHEAPEST data path — today's survivors, dividend-
adjusted total-return closes, and SAME-BAR fills — so the honesty gate that decides
"validated vs experimental" was itself dishonest, biased in the optimistic
direction. This module is the single place those four axes are made honest, so every
forward logger and desk grader can route through one convention instead of each
re-deriving a subtly-different (and subtly-flattering) one.

The four axes it standardizes
-----------------------------
1. NEXT-BAR FILL.  A signal that fires on the close of bar t is FILLED at the close
   of bar t+1 (``fill_index``/``forward_metrics`` here), matching the VALIDATED
   research convention (``research/signal_engine/tuning_harness.py`` enters at
   ``f = i + 1``) and ``engine/validation.py:70``'s ``alloc.shift(1)`` "act next
   bar". Same-bar fills flatter short mean-reversion signals most (you buy the exact
   trough the signal identified), which is precisely the direction that over-sizes a
   mechanical system. ``forward_metrics`` uses correct FORWARD windows
   (``FixedForwardWindowIndexer`` semantics — strictly ``(fill, fill+H]``), never a
   window that peeks at or includes the entry bar.

2. SURVIVORSHIP.  ``as_of_members`` (engine.universe_history — EXISTS, and this is
   its FIRST-EVER consumer) reconstructs the index membership as it stood on a date,
   so a historical cross-section grades the names that were ACTUALLY in the universe
   then, not today's survivors. Dropping delisted losers inflates every crisis-
   breadth and desk hit-rate. Cold-start caveat: membership accrual began 2026-06-13
   (see universe_history), so an as-of BEFORE accrual falls back to today's panel and
   is stamped ``survivorship='cold-start'`` — honest about the residual bias rather
   than pretending it is gone.

3. DUAL RETURN BASIS.  ``data/stocks`` (and ``data/yahoo``) ``close`` is split- AND
   dividend-back-adjusted TOTAL return (verified: AAPL has no gap across its 2020 4:1
   split). Splits cancel in every ratio, but an interim dividend rebases the entry
   bar and not the t+H bar — a bounded (<~1%/60d) but ONE-DIRECTIONAL optimism on
   forward drawdowns. Where a raw/price-only series is available we expose BOTH a
   ``price_return`` and a ``total_return`` column so a caller can size against the
   pessimistic (price-only) basis. When only the adjusted store exists, both columns
   equal the total-return number and the basis is stamped so the caller cannot mistake
   it for a true price return.

4. DELISTING TERMINAL VALUES.  A name that DELISTS mid-horizon must grade as its LOSS,
   not vanish. ``resolve_series`` falls back to the 8-K Item 1.03 bankruptcy-imputation
   store (``data/edgar/dead_name_prices.parquet``, source ``imputed_bankruptcy`` → a
   −100% terminal close) built by ``collectors/edgar_deadname_prices`` /
   ``collectors/edgar_delisting``. ``forward_metrics`` treats a name that stops trading
   inside the horizon as delisted at its last (or imputed-terminal) close, so the loss
   is realized instead of the position silently disappearing from the panel.

Design
------
* Pure pandas/numpy/pyarrow (no scipy/sklearn) — matches the thin data-bot env and
  engine/validation.py's dependency rule.
* Degrade-safe by construction: a missing dead-name store, a missing membership
  ledger, or a pre-accrual as-of date each degrade to the honest prior state with a
  stamped caveat, never a crash — but the caveat is LOUD (returned in the report), so
  "graded honestly" and "graded on the fallback" are distinguishable forever.
* This is a LIBRARY, not a runner: it does not read config or write artifacts. Callers
  (track_record, sector_signals, desk graders) pass their own series/panels in.

      - PRE-REGISTERED STRADDLE TIE RULE: if stop AND cushion/liftoff would both trigger
        on the same bar, STOP WINS (conservative; binding when high/low history is wired).

                       within [fill+1 .. fill+liftoff_horizon].

                       within [fill+1 .. fill+liftoff_horizon].
      - DEAD_MONEY:    never hit ±dead_band% AND ret_at_read < dead_cap,
                       over [fill+1 .. fill+liftoff_horizon].
      - CUSHIONED:     hit +cushion_mult before stop, but did NOT reach clean liftoff.

    Named parameterizations (§1.1):
      ``clean15_126`` — liftoff_mult=1.15, liftoff_horizon=126  (positional primary)
      ``clean8_21``   — liftoff_mult=1.08, liftoff_horizon=21   (rotational primary)

    Note on data basis: close is expected to be the dividend-adjusted total-return
    series (data/yahoo convention). Because barriers are computed as ratios to entry_price
    (also from the same series), the adjustment cancels and percentages are correct.

    ----------

    signal_date    : signal/event bar date.
    adverse_mult   : multiplier for the adverse barrier (>1; default SHORT_ADVERSE_MULT=1.05).
    favorable_mult : multiplier for the favorable barrier (<1; default SHORT_FAVORABLE_MULT_21=0.92).
    horizon        : forward window length in bars (default LIFTOFF_HORIZON_21=21).
    same_bar       : same-bar-fill override for shadow A/B tests (mirrors terminal_state).

      ``entry_price``   — fill-bar close.
      ``fill_date``     — ISO date string of the fill bar.
      ``adverse_at_bar`` — 1-indexed bar offset when adverse triggered, or None.
      ``favorable_at_bar`` — 1-indexed bar offset when favorable triggered, or None.
      ``ret_at_read``   — close[fill+horizon] / entry − 1, or None if not matured.
      ``note``          — human-readable summary.

                           from ``data/breadth/sp1500_pit_membership.parquet`` which

                           survivor-priced, but membership set is correct).
      * ``"cold-start"`` — neither the ledger nor the PIT file could supply membership;
                           falls back to today's panel (survivor-biased UPPER bound).

    W0.1a addition — ``pit_path``: explicit path to the PIT membership file; defaults to
    ``data/breadth/sp1500_pit_membership.parquet``. Pass a mock path in tests.

    ``include_dead`` unions in delisted names (from the dead-price store) that were
    members as of ``asof`` so their loss is graded, not dropped.
