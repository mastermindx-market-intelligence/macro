"""Per-name POTENTIAL score — a market-aware confluence / timing (buy-readiness) screen.

The unified "is this name set up to rise FROM HERE, and can I act on it now?" score
across every market. It answers the front-running question the user asks, instead of
a lagging within-market percentile or a reversal rank that crowned the most beaten-down
name. The legs combine as GATES, not an average, so a single deep-washout reading can
never carry a name that is still falling:

    score = 100 · trigger · (0.4 + 0.6·fuel) · survive · tailwind · confidence · edge_mult

  * trigger   — is the turn happening NOW (cycle ladder, gated by the entry gauge).
                A confirmed FRESH BUY clusters high; a still-declining knife gates to ~0.
                The trigger decides the TIER (the front-running / trend-following core).
  * fuel      — stored upside (off the 52w high + below the 200dma). Sizes WITHIN the
                tier (0.4 floor so a clean shallow-dip fresh buy stays actionable).
  * survive   — subtract-only distress haircut (crowding / panic-vol). Never a booster.
  * tailwind  — bounded theme / regime tilt (re-orders within a tier).
  * confidence— bounded forward anticipation-cone nudge (favourable shape; honest:
                ordering lever, direction ~coin-flip).
  * edge_mult — THE per-market validated-selection-edge blend (PRESERVES each market's
                real alpha). For US/CA/INTL the name's selection-axis z (US = the
                event edge: insider buying / earnings-surprise / analyst revisions; CA/
                INTL = a residual-momentum prior) tilts the score ±, so a washed-out
                turning name that ALSO has insider buying outranks an identical one with
                none — front-running timing AND validated edge, not one at the cost of the
                other. CN/HK have no validated cross-sectional name edge, so edge_mult=1
                (CN's reversal edge already lives in the washout/cycle).

HONEST CEILING: this is a TIMING + RISK + (where present) EDGE screen for entry, vol-
sized and forward-graded — never an alpha oracle. CN name selection has no proven
forward return-alpha (rank-IC ~0); the US event edge is real but small. The companion
grader (engine/name_score_grader) measures it forward by market so it earns trust.
