"""Shared plumbing for the Track-record popup ledger artifacts (`track_ledger/v1`).

Four host pages (US / CN / HK / CA) each ship a compact per-episode ledger JSON that
the Track-record popup dashboard fetches lazily and renders as a filterable table +
verdict cards. The four emitters live in their respective build scripts
(scripts/grade_us_board.py, scripts/build_china_library.py, scripts/build_hk_library.py,
scripts/build_canada.py) because each one consumes data ALREADY in memory on its own
render path (render budget is law — no redundant store reads). This module holds the
ONE piece they share: the schema shell, the numpy→pure-Python cast, the newest-first
truncation, and the tmp+rename atomic write.

Why a shared module (not four inlined copies): the numpy-scalar trap — json.dumps
crashes (or, worse, silently poisons the file via default=str) on np.float64/np.int64.
Casting every value once, in one tested place, is the only safe way to guarantee the
four artifacts are JSON-serializable. Mirrors engine/risk_radar_scorecard.py's
multi-writer atomic-write pattern.

Schema (track_ledger/v1):
    { schema, market, as_of, state, bench:{code,en,zh}, summary:{...}, rows:[...], meta:{...} }
Row compact keys:
    t ticker · nm name · sec sector · grp group · d logged/surfaced date · e entry ·
    l latest/exit · p pct vs entry · x excess vs bench pct (null ok) · dy days ·
    st up|stopped|flat|early|beat|lag|onboard · m matured bool · rk rank · tr tier ·
    fl flags subset of [locked, susp, delisted]. Nulls allowed except t, d, st.
Optional per-market row keys (consumers must tolerate their absence):
    xr exit reason · eb entry basis actually used (CN: t1_open|t1_hl2|t1_close) ·
    ed actual fill date (distinct from d, the surfaced date) · bd board definition/era ·
    er re-derived entry that DISAGREES with the published one, disclosed not substituted ·
    erw plain-word reason for that disagreement. eb/er/erw are the 2026-08-08 CN
    entry-price-integrity fields (see scripts/build_china_library._cn_ledger_rows).
