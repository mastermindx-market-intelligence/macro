"""Theme Rotation Desk — score, label and recommend across the thematic baskets.

This is the EXECUTIONAL layer the baskets page was missing. The page already shows
data (perf table, chart, the display-only Flow Lens); this engine turns that data
into a read: per theme a transparent 0-100 SCORE, a lifecycle LABEL (dominant /
emerging / fading / deteriorating / neutral), and an actionable RECOMMENDATION
(ENTER / ACCUMULATE / HOLD / TRIM / AVOID) — plus a 5-day rotation (weekly
climbers/fallers) and impulse / new-high-low scorecards.

REUSE, NOT REINVENTION. The scoring spine is engine.group_flow: `_setup()` gives the
exact close matrix (unioned with baskets/extras.parquet) + SPY benchmark the baskets
page uses, and `prep_group()` + `fingerprint_at(prep, i)` already compute the per-basket
texture (accel_z, broadening_z, breadth = % members > 50d MA, cohesion, persistence,
rs_pctile, lifecycle stage). engine.baskets supplies `_ew_level` / `_perf`. The macro
leg reads the live cross-site snapshots (regime / bonds / forex) — never recomputed.

HONEST BY CONSTRUCTION (house rule). The composite is a TRANSPARENT weighted blend and
every leg is surfaced, so the recommendation is decision-support you can audit, NOT a
validated forward-edge buy list. The baskets themselves are ~3y hindsight-curated; the
macro leg is a documented regime PRIOR (coarse economics), not fitted alpha. Framed
exactly like the Flow Lens, engine.narrative_rotation leans and engine.thematic_desk.

# forward-return IC for theme momentum and no edge for the vol-hole breakout — the ONE validated
# content is the long-trend / drawdown-control channel. So these legs carry MODEST weight, are

# Non-US regions (China A-shares / HK / Canada) usually carry no member-level OHLCV candle (the
# deep store is US-first) and no macro prior (the _MACRO_PRIOR / _SECTOR_PROXY maps below are
# US-keyed). A close-only equal-weight fallback now supplies honest D/3D/W/M structure everywhere;
# volume/tape legs remain absent when volume is unavailable. Rather than score those regions with
# (a) a dead-0 macro leg dragging every score toward 50 or (b) a blind drawdown-control gate, we
# also feed the gates two PRICE-ONLY, region-available proxies from the basket's own level:
#   • ext_abs   — how stretched the level is above its 50d MA vs its OWN trailing-year history
#                 (a self-referential z; a steady region-leader is ~0-1, a parabolic blow-off is
#                 high). Replaces the cross-sectional rs_pctile "extension" gate, which pins every
#                 trending leader at ~1.0 and so made the actual leaders permanently un-buyable.
#   • long_sign — sign of the basket's own 200d trend (price vs a rising/falling 200d MA), the
#                 region-available stand-in for mtf.confluence.long_sign (the drawdown gate).
# These are injected into `fp` for non-US ONLY, so the US page (which has the real mtf candle and
# the validated rs_pctile behaviour) is byte-identical.
# Only a genuine PARABOLIC blow-off blocks the leader's buy verb. The house rule
# ([narrative-rotation-validation]) is that crowding/extension DOWN-SIZES the dominant theme
# (via the crowding penalty → allocation sizing), it never FADES it ("fading the leader is the
# documented failure mode"). So EXT_HI is set high (≈top-2% of the theme's own stretch history):
# a leader that has merely run hard stays ACCUMULATE (down-sized), and only a vertical blow-off
# (ext_abs ≥ 2σ) is held back as "don't chase". EXT_LO starts the graded crowding penalty earlier.
EXT_HI = 2.0     # ext_abs z above this == parabolic / "don't chase" (blocks ACCUMULATE/EMERGING)
EXT_LO = 0.8     # ext_abs z above this starts contributing to the (down-sizing) crowding penalty
