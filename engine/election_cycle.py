"""Election-cycle context layer — a HONEST, evidence-gated calendar MODULATOR for the Risk
Radar. NOT an alert originator.

WHY THIS IS A MODULATOR, NEVER A LEG
------------------------------------
The owner proposed fusing the four-year presidential cycle with Brent Johnson's Dollar
Milkshake thesis: tighten in the midterm year, drain global dollar liquidity, crush
EM/HK/China/high-beta, then launch into the pre-election year. We BACKTESTED it on our own
data (SPY 1993+, the 11 SPDR sectors, DXY 1971+, SHCOMP/HSI/FXI/TSX, USD/CNH) before
wiring anything in. The verdict was sobering and is the reason this file is a *modulator*:

  • US midterm drawdowns ARE deeper on average — Apr-Oct max DD -14.6% vs -10.2% (n=8,
    Cohen d=-0.53) — but it is SUGGESTIVE-NOT-SIGNIFICANT (one-sided Mann-Whitney p~0.088;
    honest independent-episode count 5/8 vs 12/25, Fisher p=0.38). The worst year on record
    (2008, -47%) is NON-midterm: the tail does not live in midterms.
  • The Dollar-Milkshake DIRECTION is REFUTED in history: DXY Jun->Dec is -3.42% in midterm
    years vs -0.36% otherwise. The firm-dollar bucket is the ELECTION year (Y4, +2.09%). The
    dollar is, on average, WEAKER in a midterm H2 — the opposite of the thesis. (This cycle's
    firm dollar is the Iran-shock / Warsh-hawkish *idiosyncrasy* of 2026, which the radar's
    DXY/rate/CNH legs already measure directly — not a midterm-calendar effect.)
  • "EM/HK/China bears cluster in US midterms" FAILS a permutation test in all four markets
    (worst-year clustering p=0.24-0.79, none beats 25% chance). SHCOMP and FXI are actually
    MILDER in midterms; HSI's edge is one 1998 outlier; the only real hit is TSX (Canada).
    => the international radar must NOT encode a midterm EM-drawdown prior; it already has the
    validated dollar/rate/US-CN-diff/CNH/breadth legs that capture the real mechanism.
  • Sector seasonality ("XLV strongest / real estate worst") is directionally real for XLV
    (midterm Jul-Dec +7.2%, 83% win, n=6 — NOT the claimed 100%/+8%/5yr) but is MOSTLY
    ordinary defensive-H2 seasonality (XLV is +4.2% in non-midterm H2 too). Real estate's
    "0% over 5 midterms" is impossible: XLRE was born 2015-10 (only 2018 & 2022 exist, n=2).

So the ONLY genuinely non-collinear, directionally-consistent edge is narrow: in a midterm
Apr-Oct window WHILE THE TAPE IS STILL RISK-ON (SPY above its 200dMA), >=5% pullbacks have
arrived at ~1.25x the base rate (32.5% vs 26.0%). That is useful as a small sizing prior,
but the independent sample is too weak to change a measured signal's band. Everything here
is therefore display + sizing only.

WHAT THIS FILE DOES (all at the sizing/display tier — the evidence gate is untouched):
  context()    — where we are in the 4-yr cycle + the Hirsch midterm-drawdown window, with the
                 MEASURED odds (not assumed) printed so the chip can never imply false certainty.
  modulation() — a small gross (sizing) trim across the window. It NEVER changes a Risk-Radar
                 band or manufactures an alert; measured market evidence owns those decisions.
  sector_bias()— display-only defensive-rotation tilt for a midterm H2, labelled as mostly
                 generic seasonality.

All functions are pure (date in -> dict out) and never raise. Sources: this repo's backtest
(workflow midterm-milkshake-backtest); Hirsch / Stock Trader's Almanac for the window timing.
