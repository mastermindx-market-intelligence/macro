"""Advanced per-theme TEXTURES for the Theme Rotation Desk (display-only).

Refines the engine.theme_scoring read with the specific signals a user needs to time a
theme: how long it has been in a bull market, how overbought/extended it is, whether it is
an EMERGING clean entry, whether it is at ROLL-OVER risk — plus a market CONCENTRATION /
narrowness block (the user's core concern: the tape can get narrow, low advance-decline).

HONEST BY CONSTRUCTION: every texture carries `directional: False`. These DESCRIBE state
(trend age, stretch, distribution) — they do NOT forecast returns. Cross-sectional theme
momentum has ~0 rank-IC; the one validated edge is the absolute-trend (SMA-200) gate, which
is drawdown-control, not alpha. Mirrors the theme_crowding / group_flow honesty contract.
