"""engine/entry_radar/four_hour.py — the 4H session grid and C3 (W3, §18 A5.4).

BOUNDARY (contract §2), stated before anything else
---------------------------------------------------
``engine/washout_turn.py`` (WEEKLY washout-turn watch) and ``engine/mtf_upturn.py``
(TS-R3 multi-timeframe upturn, K-of-N legs) are ADJACENT display organs at a
different grain inside a different product.  C3 is a **confirmed-bar** 1D-washout
→ completed-4H-momentum-turn detector producing episodes and events.  Name
similarity is not identity; neither organ is imported or modified here (house
precedent ``engine/washout_turn.py:1-5``).

WHAT C3 IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT (§18 A5.4)
------------------------------------------
C3 is NOT "C1 fired live, now wait for 4H".  It is a CONFIRMED-BAR detector: its
daily leg is the latest **1D CONFIRMED** canonical StochRSI ``K < 20``, usable
only once that close is knowable — the next session's open, conservatively.  "The
historical parquet already has today's close" is not knowability, and a morning
C3 arm created retroactively from an evening bake is the exact leak §5 exists to
prevent.

THE 4H GRID IS A SESSION OBJECT, NOT A CLOCK OBJECT
----------------------------------------------------
Buckets are anchored at the 09:30 ET session open with a NOMINAL width of 240
minutes, and a bucket's EFFECTIVE END is ``min(start + 240m, the actual exchange
close)``.  A normal session therefore yields a full 09:30–13:30 bucket and a
CLIPPED 13:30–16:00 session-final bucket whose shorter duration is disclosed, and
a 13:00 early close yields ONE bucket ending at 13:00 — never a fabricated 16:00
and never a minute after the bell.  Windows come from
``engine.session_digest.session_window_et``, which is DST-safe and early-close
aware; wall-clock arithmetic is never used (§7).

A bucket is CONFIRMED only at its effective end.  The current incomplete bucket
may be exposed as a ``provisional`` diagnostic and C3@1 may not fire from it: a
live/partial-4H form is a separate detector version, default off (§4).

WARM-UP IS THE INDICATOR'S OWN
-------------------------------
No hand-tuned bar-count floor exists in this module.  C3 is ``unavailable`` until
canonical ``rsi_macd`` has produced enough finite histogram values to evaluate its
three-point predicate.  A hand floor is a second, wrong copy of a mathematical
fact — and it is exactly the kind of constant that drifts from the indicator it
was supposed to describe.

NETWORK STAYS OUT OF THE ENGINE
--------------------------------
Intraday aggregates arrive as an ALREADY-LOADED frame through an injectable
reader seam (:class:`IntradayReader`).  This module opens no socket, reads no
store, and holds no credentials; the bounded per-name REST fetch that feeds it
belongs to a script, and the delayed hourly chart store named in §7.2 is not a C3
substrate at any grain.
