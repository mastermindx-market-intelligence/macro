"""engine/entry_radar/indicator_core.py — Radar's ONE pinned indicator family.

BOUNDARY (contract §2), stated before anything else
---------------------------------------------------
``engine/washout_turn.py`` is the existing per-name **WEEKLY** washout-turn watch
organ; ``engine/mtf_upturn.py`` is the TS-R3 per-stock multi-timeframe upturn
organ (K-of-N legs, registered expected-NULL).  Both are ADJACENT display organs
at a different GRAIN (weekly / multi-week position and motion) inside a different
PRODUCT (watch vocabulary, not an episode ledger).  Radar's C1–C4 live at
1D-live / intraday motion grain and produce episodes, candidates and provenance.
Name similarity is not identity.  Neither module is imported here, neither is
modified by this lane, and the house precedent for stating the distinction in the
docstring is ``engine/washout_turn.py:1-5``.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS (contract §4, indicator-core law)
--------------------------------------------------------
The repo carries **two incompatible RSI families**: ``engine/canon.py``'s
SMA-seeded RMA (== Pine ``ta.rsi``, the cross-repo golden oracle) and
``engine/technicals.py``'s bare ``ewm`` variant.  They differ exactly in the
early warm-up — which is where crosses flip.  Nine StochRSI sites and five
RSI-MACD sites exist in this repo with divergent NaN policies and ``adjust``
flags.  So Radar pins **one named family, in one module**: everything a Radar
detector computes comes through here, and this module's only oscillator source is
``engine.canon`` (family R-A).

``engine.technicals`` is never imported (guard: the AST fence in
``tests/test_entry_radar_w2_guards.py`` and ``tests/test_entry_radar_w3_guards.py``).

TRANSITIVE-IMPORT NOTE, recorded rather than hidden: ``engine.stock_technicals``
— whose ``true_range``/``atr`` the §4(c) ATR law names — itself imports
``engine.technicals`` at module scope for an unrelated helper.  Importing the ATR
pair therefore LOADS that module into ``sys.modules``; it does not make Radar
compute with it.  No Radar detector calls ``engine.technicals.rsi``, the direct
import fence is intact, and ``tests/test_entry_radar_w3_guards.py`` pins both
halves (no direct import anywhere; Radar's ATR is byte-equal to
``stock_technicals.atr``, so nothing here is a second ATR implementation).

WHAT IS PINNED (and what a change to it costs)
-----------------------------------------------
``INDICATOR_CORE`` below is the constants block every detector spec embeds by
value, so changing a constant here moves every dependent ``spec_hash`` —
which is the point: a detector whose math moved silently is a detector whose
past results are no longer attributable to it.

ATR LAW (contract §18 A5.0, §4(c))
-----------------------------------
True-range Wilder ATR(14) on ACTUAL daily OHLC — ``engine/entry_signal.py``'s
``_atr_pct`` is never used anywhere in Radar (it is a close-only mean-absolute
-return misnomer, not ATR).  The value a Radar detector may use during session D
is ``atr14_prior_confirmed``, which EXCLUDES session D's own bar: a live detector
normalising by an ATR that already contains today's eventual high and low is
reading its own future.  The shift is the discipline
``engine/personality_relief_hazard.py:210-220`` already applies.

NO STATE, NO IO.  Pure functions over passed-in series.  Nothing here opens a
file, reads an env var, touches the network, or holds a cache.
