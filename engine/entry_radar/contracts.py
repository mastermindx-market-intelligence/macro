"""engine/entry_radar/contracts.py — frozen record shapes for the Radar funnel.

Three objects live here and nothing else:

  ``Nomination``     `mastermind.entry_probe_nomination.v1` — the enlistment record
                     a producer emits.  Field list FROZEN at contract §6.1.
  ``ProbeRecord``    one name in the Probe Set.  Field list frozen below.
  ``ProducerRead``   the availability tri-state wrapper every adapter returns.

Everything is validated at construction: a malformed nomination raises
``NominationError`` at the bus door rather than becoming a silently-wrong row in
a durable spool.

THE FROZEN NOMINATION FIELD LIST (contract §6.1) is exactly thirteen names.  It
is not extensible in PR-1 — a producer needing to say something the list cannot
express says it in ``reason_code``/``evidence_ref``, or the contract is amended
under §18.  ``NOMINATION_FIELDS`` is asserted against the dataclass in
``tests/test_entry_radar_w1.py`` so the freeze is mechanical, not editorial.

NO SCORES.  ``ProbeRecord`` has no score, rank, points, `candidate` boolean, or
bullish field, because admission is a coverage decision and not an opinion
(package docstring).  ``PROBE_RECORD_FIELDS`` plus ``BANNED_RECORD_TOKENS``
make that testable.  Note the asymmetry: a *nomination* may carry
``source_rank`` / ``source_value`` — those are the PRODUCER's own numbers,
preserved verbatim as provenance.  Preserving a producer's rank is honesty;
promoting it onto the probe record would be Radar adopting an opinion it did
not earn.

MEMBERSHIP-EXPANSION LAUNDERING GUARD (contract §6).  A basket-level fact must
never launder into a single-name fact.  The lock is bidirectional and lives in
``Nomination._validate``: a ``reason_code`` under the
``membership_expansion.`` prefix REQUIRES ``source_family ==
"membership_expansion"``, and that family REQUIRES that prefix.  Neither half
alone is enough — the family without the prefix lets a basket fact wear a
single-name reason, and the prefix without the family lets it wear a
single-name family.

POINT-IN-TIME (contract §5).  ``observed_at >= source_asof`` is enforced at
construction: a nomination may never be consumed before the producer artifact
that justifies it existed.  That is the "nomination postdate test" row of the
§5 leakage matrix, made structural.
