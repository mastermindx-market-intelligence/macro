"""engine/entry_radar/c5_adapter.py — C5, the Terminal Bottom Watch (W3, §18 A5.6).

BOUNDARY (contract §2), stated before anything else
---------------------------------------------------
This module is an INTERPRETER of events W2 already preserved.  It computes no
oscillator, ports no washout machinery, and opens no artifact: there is no second
production Bottom Watch implementation in this repo, by design.
``engine/washout_turn.py`` and ``engine/mtf_upturn.py`` are adjacent display
organs at a different grain and are neither imported nor modified here (house
precedent ``engine/washout_turn.py:1-5``).

WHAT C5 IS (§18 A5.6)
----------------------
The DETECTOR reading of the two preserved watch families —
``washout_early_watch``/``early_dot`` and ``washout_trigger_watch``/
``blocked_trigger``.  Three laws bind, and all three are about not damaging the
record C5 reads:

  1. **Reference, never mutate.**  A C5 reading/episode carries the watch event's
     ``event_id`` in ``evidence_refs``.  It never writes a ``detector_id`` back
     into that event, never edits it, and never mints a second event for the same
     market observation — a duplicate would double-count the observation in every
     later population read, and the append-only store would not notice because the
     two rows would carry different addresses.
  2. **Knowability is ``signal_known_ts``, never ``signal_ts``.**  A BOTTOM_WATCH
     event's ``ts`` is the 3D bar's OPEN date and can precede its own knowability
     by up to two sessions (§3.1's measured backdating: NVDA 2026-01-21 → known
     01-23).  A C5 candidate dated at ``signal_ts`` would claim a decision the
     data could not have supported yet.
  3. **``blocked_trigger`` takes precedence on a shared bar.**  That is the
     emitter's own de-duplication rule (§3.4), so when both watches land on one
     bar the trigger is the C5 candidate and the dot is recorded as superseded —
     recorded, not dropped, because "there was also a dot" is a fact about the
     bar.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT BUILT
-------------------------------
No locked-spec recomputation of the washout mask.  A5.6 permits a research-only
exact fallback for parity/PIT work "explicitly ``radar_derived``"; W3 does not
need one (the preserved events ARE the population), and building an unused
recomputation path is how a second production implementation is born.  The pinned
upstream commit and the exact formulas ride ``C5_SPEC`` so a future parity harness
inherits the pin instead of re-deriving it.
