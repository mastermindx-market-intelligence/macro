"""engine/entry_radar/nomination_bus.py — candidate enlistment bus.

The single door every lobe nomination walks through.  It does four things and
deliberately nothing else:

1. **Ingest** producer reads, preserving the availability tri-state.  A read is
   never unwrapped into a bare list — ``unavailable`` has to survive the door,
   because downstream retention branches on it (contract §5).
2. **Dedup on identity ``(source_id, ticker, source_asof, reason_code,
   evidence_ref)``.**  A duplicate is an idempotent re-read — the same producer,
   the same vintage, the same fact about the same evidence.  Everything else is
   kept: one ticker may carry many nominations from many producers AND several
   from one producer (a board lists a name in two lanes; a basket names it as
   both leader and strongest), and collapsing any of them is the §16 A1
   no-flattening violation.

   The invariant that makes this checkable: **what the spool holds and what the
   Probe Set publishes must agree.**  A narrower identity broke it silently —
   two events spooled, one record published, zero refusals counted.
3. **Expire** on ``ttl_until``.  Expiry removes a nomination from the ACTIVE
   set; it never deletes the spooled event (no silent signal deletion, §16).
4. **Disclose correlated families** by ``source_id`` prefix, so a downstream
   reader can see that ``stockdata:entry_signal`` and ``stockdata:setups`` are
   one artifact read twice rather than two independent confirmers (Track C §1.3
   shared-upstream clusters).  Nomination guarantees probing; predictive weight
   must be earned independently per family (§6.1) — the bus makes the
   correlation visible so nobody can double-count by accident.

SPOOL BEFORE CONSUME (contract §5, PR-1 acceptance)
---------------------------------------------------
When a spool is attached, a nomination becomes consumable only after its event
is durably spooled.  A failed spool write leaves the nomination in
``refused_unspooled`` with a line-start annotation, not in the active set.  The
ephemeral producers (hot_tape, flow_pulse fastpath) have no artifact vintage to
replay, so an unspooled nomination is a fact that will never be reconstructible
— admitting on it would put an ungradeable episode into the forward ledger.

A bus constructed with ``spool=None`` runs undurable and says so via
``durable``; that mode is for unit tests of the funnel, never for the lane.

NO SCORING HAPPENS HERE.  The bus counts nothing, weights nothing, and ranks
nothing.  Five nominations is not "stronger" than one.
