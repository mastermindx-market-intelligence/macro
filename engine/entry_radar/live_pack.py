"""engine/entry_radar/live_pack.py — the frozen evaluation substrate (W4, §7.1).

BOUNDARY (contract §2), stated before anything else
---------------------------------------------------
Nothing here is a detector.  Every firing decision in this module is delegated to
the UNMODIFIED W3 code path (``indicator_core`` → ``challengers`` → ``four_hour``);
this module freezes what those functions read and inverts their conditions into
price levels.  No spec block is defined here, no ``spec_hash`` is computed here,
and a drift between the published hashes and the registry REFUSES the build
rather than publishing a pack attributed to a detector that has moved.

WHY A PACK EXISTS AT ALL (contract §7.1, W4 design §1)
-------------------------------------------------------
§7.1's law is that **the intraday lane never re-derives a signal from a mutable
store**.  A mid-session store move (a corporate-action re-adjustment, a late
backfill, a wrong-session series) does not merely stale an oscillator — it
*fabricates crossings*, which is why §5's stale-pack row demands ``unavailable``
for the whole cycle rather than a best-effort read.  So the substrate is frozen
ONCE, off-RTH, per name:

  ``as_of_close``               the basis-audit anchor (§5 price-basis row)
  ``last_confirmed``            per-name, and may LAG ``as_of`` — such a name is
                                ``stale`` downstream through W3's own
                                :func:`challengers.freshness_state`, never
                                silently current
  ``atr14_prior_confirmed``     via :func:`indicator_core.atr14` on the frozen
                                frame — the house ATR, never a second one
  ``confirmed_k`` / ``confirmed_d``  canonical StochRSI on the frozen closes;
                                feeds the §10 re-arm ledger and C3's daily-leg
                                receipt
  ``c1_arm_price`` / ``c2a_cross_price``  the inverted thresholds

THE INVERSION IS A BISECTION AGAINST THE W3 ORACLE, NOT A FORMULA
------------------------------------------------------------------
There is no closed form for "the close at which %K crosses 20": %K is an SMA(3)
over a rolling-extreme transform of an RMA-seeded RSI.  Rather than derive a
second implementation — the exact defect ``indicator_core``'s docstring exists to
prevent — the boundary is found by BISECTING the same function the live lane will
run.  ``_oracle_kd`` mirrors :func:`challengers.build_observation_path`'s series
construction line for line (confirmed closes through ``as_of`` plus ONE appended
row indexed at the NEXT session — §7.1's measured append-not-replace law), so a
threshold and the reading it predicts cannot disagree by construction.

§7.1's two hardenings are implemented, not optional:

  (1) **degenerate cases are explicit** — a bracket over which no price reaches
      the condition emits ``no_threshold_exists`` with one of four named reasons
      (``flat_rsi_nan`` · ``always_true`` · ``never_true`` · ``non_monotone``),
      never an absent or unbounded level;
  (2) the **stale-pack gate** is the caller's (:func:`pack_is_fresh`); this module
      refuses to pretend a pack is current.

EXACTNESS AT THE BOUNDARY.  C1's arm is a STRICT ``K < 20`` and C2a's cross is a
STRICT ``K > D``, so "the price where it flips" is ambiguous unless the oracle's
verdict AT the returned level is recorded.  ``condition_at_boundary`` is that
verdict, and the evaluator's cross-check reads
``condition(p) == (p < price) or (p == price and condition_at_boundary)`` for a
``below`` threshold (mirrored for ``above``).

THE PROOF PACK IS A FALSIFICATION INSTRUMENT (W4 design §1, commission amendment)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:func:`build_inversion_proof` probes every load-bearing frozen boundary from BOTH
sides and refuses to publish a pack whose thresholds disagree with the oracle.
It tunes nothing, optimises nothing, reads no forward outcome, ranks nothing and
never touches a spec hash — a failing case marks the pack ``proof_failed`` and
the RTH evaluator refuses the cycle.  The proof re-derives each verdict FROM the
oracle rather than from the stored threshold, which is what makes a corrupted
threshold detectable at all (a receipt written from the variable it checks cannot
fail).

WHAT THIS MODULE MAY WRITE
--------------------------
The pack and its pointer, under an INJECTED ``state_dir`` (production:
``/var/lib/macro-live/state/entry_radar``).  Never ``data/`` — no ``data/`` path
literal appears in this file, and the daily store arrives through the injected
``store_reader`` so the engine cannot reach it directly.  No network, no wall
clock: ``as_of``, ``built_at`` and ``now`` are always passed in.

W4/W5 FIREWALL.  No forward return, MFE/MAE, hit rate, grade or detector
comparison exists here.  Every field is knowable at ``as_of``.
