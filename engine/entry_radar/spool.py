"""engine/entry_radar/spool.py — the durable prospective nomination spool.

WHY THIS EXISTS AT PR-1 AND NOT PR-5
------------------------------------
Two of Radar's highest-value nomination producers are **ephemeral**: the 5-min
``engine/marketing/hot_tape.py`` detector writes no ``data/`` artifact at all
(only a marketing outbox), and ``build_intraday_flow.py --mode fastpath`` writes
zero ``data/`` by design (HOUSE-U5).  Their history is therefore
**unreconstructible after the fact** — there is no vintage to replay
(contract §5 leakage matrix, ephemeral-producers row; §11 Q4).

So the record has to be made *as it happens*, from day one, before any detector
or episode exists to consume it.  Every ingested nomination event is appended
here at ingestion.  A nomination that was never spooled may never enter an
episode later — that is the "spool-before-consume" test.

WRITE TARGET — NEVER ``data/``
------------------------------
Convention SHAPE copied from the prophet-live R2 plane
(``engine/prophet_live/r2io.py``): **one object per pass-with-events**, keyed
``live_flow/entry_radar_nominations/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<HHMMSS>.json``, never
read-modify-write — two passes can never both be holding the day's file, so no
row can be lost to the shared-``.tmp`` erasure class.  The module is a *shape*
copy rather than an import: this package stays a leaf with no Prophet-side
imports (contract §16 non-interference (a)).

Backends, in order: R2 when credentials exist, else a local directory
(``$ENTRY_RADAR_SPOOL_DIR``) — which is what tests use.  Neither is under
``data/``: the nightly reconciler of PR-5 is the only durable ``data/`` writer.

``ENTRY_RADAR_NO_PUBLISH=1`` refuses every write with a line-start annotation.
Set it in any rehearsal or demo that runs the real lane end to end — the spool
is the forward ledger's raw input, and a fabricated row joined to real closes is
indistinguishable from a genuine one forever (the prophet-live precedent).

HOT-TAPE TAP — WHY IT LIVES HERE
---------------------------------
``tap_hot_tape_events`` is in the spool module rather than ``producers/``
because hot_tape is the one producer with **no artifact to adapt**: its
nomination does not exist unless it is captured at emission and spooled in the
same breath.  The tap is a pure function the marketing lane *could* call; this
PR does not modify ``engine/marketing/hot_tape.py``.

    FOLLOW-UP (one line, PR-4 wiring, deliberately not taken in PR-1):
    in ``engine/marketing/hot_tape.py``'s ``detect_events()`` caller
    (``scripts/hot_tape_radar.py``), after events are computed, add

        from engine.entry_radar.spool import spool_hot_tape          # noqa
        spool_hot_tape(events, source_asof=<merge ts>)

    That is the whole integration.  It is out of scope here because the hard
    laws for this PR forbid edits outside the Radar-owned paths, and because a
    tap on a 5-min marketing lane wants its own review.

Until that wiring lands, ``tail_outbox_events`` is the PROSPECTIVE fallback: it
reads the marketing outbox (``data/marketing/outbox/*.json`` — a READ, this
package writes no ``data/`` path) and recovers ticker mentions from posts
already emitted.  It is strictly weaker than the tap (the outbox carries what
was *published*, not what was *detected*) and is labelled ``data_quality =
degraded`` for exactly that reason.

READ-SIDE SEAM (LAB-0 §6, added for the Prophet Operator Lab's commissioning
prep — never a second R2 client)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
``r2_credentials_present``/``r2_client_for_read``/``r2_bucket_name``/
``list_r2_keys``/``get_r2_object_bytes``, just above :class:`NominationSpool`,
are a public wrapper onto the exact credential/client logic ``_put`` already
builds, plus a minimal list/get pair — extracted so
``engine.prophet_lab.sources`` (an injectable-root READER of this module's
own event-spool output) can resolve the identical R2-first-else-local ladder
without duplicating credential handling or building a second client. The
WRITE path (``NominationSpool``/``EventSpool``) is unchanged by this addition.
