"""engine/entry_radar/live_eval.py — the 5-minute RTH pass (W4 design §2).

WHAT THIS MODULE IS
-------------------
One bounded, PURE evaluation cycle: session window → pack gate → quote intake →
price-basis audit → journal append → observation construction → the UNMODIFIED
W3 evaluators → ledger diff → spool-before-commit → payload + health receipt.

Everything volatile is INJECTED — ``now``, the quote book, the pack, the state
directory, the ledger, the spool sink and the C3 minute reader.  The module
opens no socket, reads no clock and names no vendor.  That is what makes the
whole cycle replayable from a fixture and what keeps the PIT battery honest: a
mutation test can only prove "nothing after T influenced the reading at T" if T
is a value the test chooses rather than a value the module reads.

THE EVALUATOR IS STRUCTURALLY UNABLE TO READ TOMORROW
-----------------------------------------------------
There is no store access here at all.  The confirmed daily substrate arrives
frozen in the nightly pack (``live_pack.LivePack.substrate``), today's tape is
built ONLY from journaled quote points, and prior sessions' observations are
replayed from the journal VERBATIM rather than recomputed against a newer pack.
An eventual EOD bar, a corrected close, a next-session row — none of them are on
any read path this module owns.  ``data/`` is never opened, let alone written.

THE ONE DERIVED CONSTRUCTION, AND ITS PIN (W4 design §1)
---------------------------------------------------------
:func:`challengers.build_observation_path` recomputes the whole oscillator chain
per sampled point, which is exact but O(points²) per session across the probe
set.  :class:`IncrementalObservationBuilder` computes the per-session preamble
ONCE and takes each already-JOURNALED interval verbatim, so a pass costs one
chain evaluation per interval that closed since the previous pass — normally
exactly one — instead of one per interval since the open.

THE JOURNAL IS THE MEMO, and it has to be: the lane is a systemd ONESHOT, one
process per pass, so an in-memory memo on a builder constructed per name per
pass is empty on arrival and the cost is O(intervals-since-open) every time
(measured by the two-pass call-count regression below).  Today's derived
observations are therefore appended to the session journal beside the quote
points — append-only, frozen at write, pinned to the same ``pack_hash`` — and a
pass computes the chain ONLY for intervals with no journaled observation.  That
is lawful rather than merely cheap: an interval is emitted only once its END has
passed, and the journal refuses a point that would land inside an already-
sampled interval, so a journaled observation can never be contradicted by a
later tick.  Recomputing it would be re-deriving a published reading.

It is byte-identical BY CONSTRUCTION, not by inspection: the preamble is the
same expression list, the chain is the same two ``indicator_core`` calls on the
same appended series, and the availability/basis/freshness decisions are the
same branch.  ``tests/test_entry_radar_w4_live.py`` pins that claim against
``build_observation_path`` over the fixture corpus (PIT-W4-16) — including gaps,
stale history, basis mismatch and early closes — because a construction that is
merely believed identical is a second implementation waiting to drift.

THE BASIS AUDIT RUNS BEFORE THE ENGINE (W3-1 carried forward)
---------------------------------------------------------------
The pack's ``as_of_close`` is an ADJUSTED store close; the feed's ``prevClose``
is a RAW prior-session close.  When they disagree past tolerance the two halves
of the concatenated series describe different scales, and the seam between them
FABRICATES a move — which fabricates a cross, which mints a candidate.  So the
audit happens before any observation exists for that name: a mismatched name
gets no tape, no observation, no reading with a verdict, and a receipt carrying
both closes and the gap.  Nothing is ever re-based into compliance.  A name the
feed gave no ``prevClose`` for is UNVERIFIED, not verified: it still evaluates
(absence is not disagreement — §5's row is about a gap past tolerance) and the
health block counts it separately so a feed that stops publishing ``prevClose``
cannot look like a healthy zero-mismatch pass.

FAIL CLOSED, AND SAY WHICH DOOR CLOSED
---------------------------------------
Four whole-cycle refusals — ``killed``, ``out_of_window``, ``stale_pack``,
``proof_failed`` — publish a payload in which every probe name is
``unavailable``, ZERO transitions exist and NOTHING is spooled.  Per-name
refusals — ``basis_mismatch``, ``pack_integrity``, ``no_quote``,
``stale_quote``, ``no_substrate`` — dark exactly one name while the rest of the
pass proceeds.  Every one of them is a named reason on the row and a counter in
the health block, because "no events this pass" has to be distinguishable from
"nothing could be evaluated this pass".

NULL LAW.  ``unavailable`` and ``stale`` are never ``False``.  A refused name
carries ``condition_met=None`` and no episode; it never carries a measured
non-fire.  See ``challengers.NULL_AVAILABILITY``.

W4/W5 FIREWALL.  Nothing here inspects a forward return, computes MFE/MAE,
grades a detector or compares two of them.  RESOLVED-at-H is calendar
bookkeeping and lives in the pack builder's clock overlay, not on this path.
:data:`FORBIDDEN_KEY_TOKENS` (minus :data:`FIREWALL_EXEMPT_KEYS`) below is the
mechanical statement of that boundary — a blacklist of forward-knowledge SHAPES
rather than a whitelist of key names, for the reason given at its own docstring —
and ``tests/test_entry_radar_w4_liveness.py`` enforces it over every emitted key.

#: SIGTERM it mid-window, which loses the work rather than deferring it.
#:
#: The bound is not a haircut on the signal: a completed session is cached

#: state costs ONE request per name per pass (today's tail).  The budget is spent

#: lives in ``vendor_minutes``, and this module must not import the concrete
#: reader (the evaluator takes an INJECTED one — that is the whole seam); and a
#: future reader's own error class is classified by whatever it subclasses
#: without this table having to know it exists.
#:
#: The classes are siblings, NOT subclasses of each other: ``LiveEvalError`` and
#: ``ChallengerError`` are both ``EntryEventError``, ``C3Error`` is a
#: ``ChallengerError``, ``VendorMinutesError`` is a ``C3Error`` and ``LedgerError``
#: is a third ``EntryEventError``.  Catching only ``LiveEvalError`` — which is what
#: this module used to do — let every one of the others kill the whole pass.
#:
#: ORDER IS SIGNIFICANT — ``error_reason`` walks it and takes the first class name
#: present in the exception's MRO, so the SPECIFIC entries come first.
#: ``JournalRefused`` before ``LiveEvalError`` is the load-bearing pair: mapping
#: every ``LiveEvalError`` to ``journal_refused`` was correct while the journal
#: pin was the only one, and became a lie the moment the off-diagonal
#: tape-session guard raised the same base class — a BUILDER bug would have been
#: reported on the row as a journal refusal, sending a reader to the state dir to

#: (``live_ledger.NULL_ONLY_FIELDS``).
#:

#: is ever widened to ``size``/``gate``/``escalate``/``priority`` they would be
#: flagged together — and an exemption added in that moment, under pressure to
#: make the sweep pass, would be an exemption nobody reviewed.  Listing them now
#: makes that widening visible instead.  ``test_entry_radar_w4_liveness.py`` pins

    THREE LAWS, all mechanical:

    * **Append-only within a session.**  A point whose vendor timestamp is not
      strictly after the last journaled one is REFUSED and counted.  Without
      that rule a backdated or duplicated vendor row would land INSIDE an
      already-sampled interval, and ``sample_session_path`` — which admits every
      minute knowable by the interval's end — would silently rewrite a reading
      that had already been published.  A future tick cannot do this (it is not
      knowable at an earlier interval's end), which is why PIT-W4-1 is provable
      by construction; a PAST tick can, which is why it is refused here.
    * **Pinned to the pack.**  Every file records the ``pack_hash`` that produced
      it.  Reading a session's journal under a DIFFERENT pack refuses rather
      than replaying yesterday's prices through today's substrate — that
      re-derivation is exactly the backfill §7.1 forbids.
    * **Prior sessions are replayed VERBATIM.**  The observations a multi-day
      episode needs are the ones that were computed on the session's OWN pack.
      Recomputing them against a pack with one more confirmed bar would move
      every K and D in the episode's history.

    ``state_dir is None`` (no state plane — a dev checkout, a CI runner) degrades
    to an in-memory journal.  The pass still evaluates today; it simply has no
    prior sessions to replay and nothing survives the process.

    * the PREAMBLE (confirmed closes, their index, the prior-confirmed ATR, the
      basis agreement, the history freshness) depends only on the frozen daily
      frame and the session — computed once, in ``__init__``;
    * the CHAIN (``stoch_rsi_kd`` + ``rsi_macd_hist`` on the confirmed closes
      with one appended provisional close) depends only on the sampled close —
      memoised by that float.

    The memo is keyed by the sampled close rather than by the interval, which is
    what makes a carry-forward interval free: ``sample_session_path`` repeats the
    previous value across an interval with no prints, and the repeated value hits
    the same chain result.  It is also why a CHANGED journal point cannot serve a
    stale reading — a different price is a different key.

    THAT MEMO DIES WITH THE PROCESS, so it is not the one that matters.  The lane
    is a oneshot: one process per pass, one builder per name per pass, so
    ``_chain`` is empty on arrival every time and by itself buys only the
    carry-forward dedup WITHIN a pass.  The memo that survives is the session
    JOURNAL, handed to :meth:`observations` as ``journaled``: an interval already
    written there is taken verbatim and no chain runs for it at all.  Both are
    kept — the journal answers "has this interval ever been computed", the price
    memo answers "have I already computed this price in THIS pass".

        The branch order is ``build_observation_path``'s, line for line: basis
        disagreement or a missing sampled close or an empty confirmed history
        yields ``unavailable``; a stale history yields the freshness state and no
        chain at all; otherwise the chain runs and ``unavailable`` still wins when
        %K did not warm up.

        ``journaled`` is the ALREADY-COMPUTED prefix (design §1, the O(1) claim).
        An interval present there is emitted verbatim and its chain is never
        re-evaluated: it closed on an earlier pass, the journal refuses any point
        that could land inside it, so the only thing a recomputation could do is
        disagree.  ``journaled=None`` — every test of the parity pin, and every
        replay — computes the whole path, which is what keeps PIT-W4-16 a real
        comparison rather than a comparison of a cache with itself.

        THE TAPE'S SESSION MUST BE THE BUILDER'S.  ``confirmed_through`` and every
        emitted ``market_session`` come from ``self.session`` while the sampled
        grid comes from ``tape.session``; handing in a tape from another session
        silently produces a different %K against a different confirmed history
        (measured: 15.25 vs the oracle's 65.46, no error).  The oracle keys both
        halves off ``tape.session``, so the only lawful call is the diagonal.

        ``now`` TRUNCATES THE GRID, and it is the difference between a replay and
        a live pass.  ``sample_session_path`` builds every interval of the
        session and CARRIES the last known value across intervals with no prints
        — correct for a completed session, and a leak mid-session: a 10:02 pass
        would otherwise emit an observation stamped 15:55 with today's 10:00
        price, and C1 could arm at an instant that has not happened.  An interval
        is knowable at its END, so only points with ``observed_at <= now``
        survive.  ``now=None`` treats the session as fully elapsed — the SAME
        contract, spelling and default as ``four_hour.four_hour_buckets``, so the
        two grids cannot drift apart on what "confirmed" means, and the replay
        case stays byte-identical to ``build_observation_path``.

    refusal (PIT-W4-7) is that argument, not a filter applied afterwards.

    A reader exposing ``buckets(ticker, session, now=)`` is preferred over the
    bare protocol call: that is the cached path, and a completed session served
    from the state dir costs no request at all.  A plain callable — every test

    session range or it is not called: ``four_hour_turn`` reads positional
    neighbours of the completed-4H series, so a session dropped by a transient
    502 does not thin the series, it rebuilds every point of it and can put a
    calendar gap between prev2/prev/now.  A missing session is missing INPUT and
    the caller reports it as such (``c3_incomplete_window``, availability
    ``unavailable``) — never as a name with no turn.  ``completed_4h_gaps`` cannot
    cover this: it counts buckets that were FETCHED and empty, and a session
    never fetched contributes no bucket at all.

    THE WINDOW START IS CLAMPED to the reader's own bound.  An ARMED C3 episode
    older than ``max_window_sessions − warm-up`` otherwise makes ``assert_window``
    raise on EVERY pass, and C3's arm expiry is internal to ``run_c3`` — so the
    code that would expire the episode is the code that cannot run, and the wedge
    is permanent.  Clamped, the pass survives and ``run_c3``'s own §10 clock
    expires the episode on the shortened window.
