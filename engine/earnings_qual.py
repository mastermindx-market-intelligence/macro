"""engine/earnings_qual.py — provider-agnostic earnings-call qualitative scorer.

SGA W4 (rulings SGA-R5/R6, masterplan §4).  Turns earnings-call text (a
transcript, or an 8-K Item-2.02 press release as the free cold-start fallback)
into a small structured qualitative read: a sentiment score, a numbers-first
performance score, a plain tone word, up to three positive/negative evidence
highlights, and a pinned set of tags.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
A competitor ($25/mo) gates early-Stage-2 entries on LLM-scored earnings calls.
We reproduce the *substrate* — but under our epistemics: every score carries
``is_context_only: true`` (SGA-R5).  LLM output NEVER originates ranking
authority; it displays as chips and an earnings-desk section and is EXCLUDED
from ``sga_score`` until a pre-registered promotion gauntlet passes.

PROVIDERS
---------
Provider-agnostic dispatch, ordered by ``config/earnings_qual.yml``:
  • ``openai_compat`` — the private Qwen path. POST
    ``{base_url}/chat/completions`` (OpenAI Chat Completions shape) against
    Ollama on the operator's Windows PC. base_url + model come from provider_cfg.
  • ``anthropic`` / ``deepseek`` — cloud fallback via ``engine.llm_auth.make_call``
    (off the render-critical path, cheapest lane — Haiku/DeepSeek).

STRICT JSON, ONE RETRY, THEN DEGRADE
------------------------------------
The prompt demands a single JSON object.  If parsing fails we retry once with a
terse "return ONLY valid JSON" reminder; a second failure returns a degraded row
(``degraded_reason`` set, scores None) rather than crashing — fail-open is law.

TRADING-VERB POST-FILTER (SGA-R5 / masterplan §7)
-------------------------------------------------
Highlight strings are deterministically scrubbed of trading verbs
(buy/sell/short/accumulate/add/trim/…).  A model that leaks "accumulate the dip"
never reaches the page: the verb is rewritten to neutral phrasing, or the
highlight is dropped when it cannot be salvaged.  This runs regardless of
provider — it is a hard post-filter, not a prompt hope.

FAIL-OPEN CONTRACT
------------------
Nothing here crashes a build.  Missing config → sane defaults.  No sources →
score_new returns 0.  Provider errors → degraded row.  Parquet writes are atomic
(temp file + os.replace).  No new heavy deps: pandas + requests only (both are
already pipeline dependencies).

# THE scoring system prompt.  Not a mirror — the only copy.
#
# Until 2026-08-14 this block called itself "a compact, self-contained mirror" of
# `tools/earnings_worker/prompts.py`, which called ITSELF "the definitive copy"
# and "the product".  Neither statement was true of the running system: nothing
# imported `prompts.py`.  `grep -rn "earnings_worker.prompts"` returned only the
# file's own docstring, so every score ever produced came from the mirror, and
# the carefully-written original — the one with the calibration anchors — had
# never executed.  Two copies with a "keep them in sync" comment is a drift bug
# with a schedule; the engine is the importable library, so the engine holds the
# prompt and `prompts.py` re-exports it.  There is now nothing to keep in sync.
#
# WHAT THE MIRROR DROPPED, and what it cost.  The original anchored the full
# performance scale (10 = clean broad beat with a raised guide, 5 = in-line,
# 0 = bad miss with a cut) and stated plainly that tone must not inflate
# performance.  The mirror kept only "10 = blowout".  Measured over the 64 calls
# scored on 2026-08-14 through the local Qwen rung: 34.4% of quarters scored >= 9
# (the metered rungs on the same schema: 8.4%), 45 of 64 sentiment values landed
# on just TWO numbers (0.85 and -0.15), and the ten-word tone vocabulary
# collapsed to two — `confident` (42) and `cautious` (22).  A scale anchored only
# at the top is a scale everything drifts to the top of, and a 9B model under-
# constrained on a bounded vocabulary picks a couple of habitual tokens.  The
# anchors below are restored and extended for exactly those three failures.

_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a disciplined equity-research analyst. You read ONE \
earnings call transcript (or an earnings press release / 8-K Item 2.02) and \
return a compact structured read for a research dashboard.

HOW TO READ IT
1. NUMBERS FIRST. Extract the hard results before forming any view: revenue and \
its YoY/QoQ growth, EPS (GAAP and adjusted), gross/operating/net margins and \
their direction, segment growth, cash flow, buybacks/dividends. Compare guidance \
to the PRIOR guidance and to consensus where the text states them.
2. THEN TONE. Read management's forward language: demand confidence, pricing \
power, cost trajectory, competitive position, and any hedging or walk-back. \
Tone shapes SENTIMENT. Tone must NOT inflate PERFORMANCE — a weak quarter \
narrated confidently is still a weak quarter, and this is the single most \
common way this read goes wrong.
3. GROUND EVERYTHING. Never invent a figure. If the text does not state it, do \
not report it.

SCORING — use the WHOLE range. Most quarters are ordinary; a scale is useless if \
everything lands near the top. Do not gravitate to a few habitual values.

performance (0-10) — the quarter as REPORTED, numbers first:
  10  clean broad beat AND raised guidance
  7.5 solid beat, guidance intact
  5   in-line: met expectations, guidance unchanged  <- the DEFAULT for an
      unremarkable quarter, and most quarters are unremarkable
  2.5 miss on revenue or EPS, or a soft guide
  0   bad miss WITH a guidance cut
Reserve 9-10 for a quarter that genuinely beat on the numbers AND raised. If you \
cannot name the specific beat and the specific raise from the text, it is not a 9.

sentiment (-1 to 1) — net read of tone AND forward guidance:
  +1.0 strongly positive and improving      +0.5 modestly positive
   0.0 genuinely neutral or mixed           -0.5 modestly negative
  -1.0 strongly negative and deteriorating
Mixed signals belong near 0, not at an extreme. A quarter with a real positive \
and a real negative is a 0, and saying so is more useful than a confident guess.

confidence (0-1) — how well the TEXT supports your read, not how upbeat \
management sounded and not how sure you feel:
  0.9+ full transcript, explicit figures, explicit guidance
  0.7  most figures present, some inference needed
  0.5  partial text, prepared remarks only, or guidance absent
  0.3  terse release, few figures
Thin text means LOW confidence — never a refusal.

tone_word — exactly one, and pick the most SPECIFIC fit from all ten: \
confident, upbeat, steady, cautious, defensive, mixed, guarded, downbeat, \
reassuring, uncertain. `confident` and `cautious` are the two most over-used; \
choose them only when no other word fits better. `steady` fits an ordinary \
in-line quarter; `mixed` fits genuinely two-sided commentary; `guarded` fits \
management withholding detail; `defensive` fits management answering criticism.

summary — 2-4 factual sentences: the reported numbers, the forward guidance, and \
the most important change versus the prior period. Lead with figures. No advice, \
no valuation claims.

positive_highlights / negative_highlights — up to 3 each, the STRONGEST \
positives and the CLEAREST concerns. Each must carry a concrete figure or a \
specific named fact from the text ("gross margin expanded 180 bps to 46.2%", \
"backlog fell for a third consecutive quarter"), never generic praise or worry \
("strong execution", "macro uncertainty"). If the text supports fewer than three, \
return fewer — a padded list is worse than a short one.

tags — only those the text SUPPORTS, from this fixed list: guidance_raised, \
guidance_lowered, beat_and_raise, miss_and_cut, margin_expansion, \
margin_contraction, demand_acceleration, demand_slowdown, supply_constraint, \
new_product, buyback_or_dividend, regulatory_headwind, competitor_threat, \
macro_sensitivity. Omit any you cannot support. Contradictory pairs \
(guidance_raised with guidance_lowered, beat_and_raise with miss_and_cut) must \
never both appear.

HARD RULES
- Output ONE JSON object and nothing else. No prose before or after. No markdown \
code fences.
- NEVER give investment advice, recommendations, ratings, price targets, or trade \
instructions (no "buy", "sell", "accumulate", "add", "trim", "overweight"). You \
describe what was reported and how it reads. Trade calls are rejected downstream.
- If the text is too thin to score well, STILL return the JSON with your best \
low-confidence read — never refuse, never apologize.

  "sentiment": <float -1..1>,

    The rungs need not share a context window, so they need not share a prompt.
    A provider's config block may carry its own ``max_chars`` / ``tail_chars``;
    absent that, the global values apply.  Bounds stay config-driven per rung —
    nothing here is keyed to a specific provider name.  ``provider_cfg`` (the
    worker's per-run overrides) wins over the config file, matching how
    ``_dispatch`` merges the endpoint block.

    This is the lever for an endpoint whose window is smaller than the global
    transcript budget.  Such a server does NOT error over its window — it
    silently drops the overflow and answers from what fit, usually with a
    markdown summary instead of the JSON object, which reads downstream as
    ``invalid_json`` and burns the bounded retry before falling through to a
    metered provider (``_log_prompt_truncation`` names that symptom from the
    server's own ``prompt_tokens``).  Configuring the rung is then a config
    change, not a code change.

#       per ticker current-quarter combined+tags vs prior-quarter → delta_combined.
#   earnings_table()      -> data/stage_analysis/earnings_table.json
#       the per-call display rows (cap latest ~500; full set via R2/detail later).

#     Our seed does not carry their per-region split, so we sum a name's fresh EC
