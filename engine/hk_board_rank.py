"""HK Prophet v1 — the US priority engine, parameterised for the Hong Kong board.

Program: ``research/HK_BOARD_RESURRECTION_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md`` (gates G1-G8).
Machinery: :mod:`engine.us_board_rank` (the shared scoring pass).  This module holds the
HK PARAMETERS and the two-and-a-half HK-specific lanes; it does not re-implement
the score.  Weights, the tier/entry maps, the stage buckets, the featured cascade,
the percentile transform, the freshness resolver and the ran-lane anchor discipline
are all IMPORTED, so the two boards cannot silently drift apart — a re-tune of
``SCORE_WEIGHTS`` moves both, which is the point (one scoring language, two markets).

WHAT IS ACTUALLY DIFFERENT HERE, and why:

1. ``edge`` reads the FUSED HK EDGE, not ``row["alpha"]``.  The leg's charter is
   "the selection axis" — the quantity a market's own measurement found
   positive-IC.  The US spells that ``alpha`` (residual alpha).  HK does not: the
   HK board's selection axis is ``edge_z``, the regime-weighted fusion of southbound
   flow, A/H value and beta-neutral relative strength (``engine.hk_stock_signals.hk_edge``,
   landed in the ``stock_score`` selection slot by the builder).  ``row["alpha"]`` on
   an HK row is a DIFFERENT quantity — the raw trailing-3-month total-return z — and
   it is what the LEADERS lane ranks on.  Pointing ``edge`` at it would collapse the
   buy lane and the leaders lane onto one number and delete the distinction G2 exists
   to draw.  See :func:`selection_value`.

2. ``featured`` carries a TURNOVER floor (:data:`FEATURED_MIN_ADV_HKD`).  The US
   board inherits its liquidity hygiene upstream; the HK universe spans a 250x
   turnover range (measured 2026-07-31 across the 158 names carrying a reading:
   5th percentile HK$7.3m/day, median HK$248m), so a promotion flag with no
   turnover test can feature a name a reader cannot get filled in.  Fail-closed:
   an unknown turnover is ``adv_unknown``, never a pass.

3. Three lanes the US board keeps in its builder or does not have at all live here
   as tested functions: :func:`build_leaders_rows` (G2), :func:`build_ran_rows`
   (G3, a thin HK wrapper over the shared implementation) and
   :func:`build_vetoed_rows` (G1/G6 — see below).

THE VETOED LANE, and why it exists (read before deleting it).  MEASURED on the
committed 2026-07-31 close panel: of the seven names the operator named as missing,
a FAITHFUL port of the US lanes surfaces exactly TWO (9618.HK in leaders+ran,
3690.HK in ran).  The other five are not borderline — they sit 10-26% BELOW their
own 200-day averages and 29-52% off their 52-week highs, so every intact-trend gate
rejects them correctly.  They are nonetheless the names a reader looks for, and each
one carries a signal the board FIRED and then BLOCKED: ``last.quality == "block"``,
reason ``"counter-trend, no 200-reclaim/hold"``.  The vetoed lane prints exactly
that — the blocked marker, how long the veto has stood, and what the name did since —
which is the masterplan's G6 instruction ("ship display-tier relief first: make
blocked names VISIBLE with the blocking reason named") and, bluntly, the veto's own
receipt.  It is the lane that shows what the board MISSED, so it must not be quietly
dropped when it reads badly; that is when it is doing its job.

FENCES.
* ``hk_leadership`` is DISPLAY-TIER (HKRV-R5).  Its cohort may boost the LEADERS
  lane's order and chip any lane, and it orders the vetoed lane.  It never touches
  rank, size or gate on the GRADED buy lane — :func:`score_rows` cannot see it.
* Nothing here changes MEMBERSHIP of the buy lane.  The confluence cascade is still
  the only admission gate; this module adds fields and decides ORDER.
* The 200-day veto itself is NOT touched.  G6 routes any change to it through a
  pre-registered measurement, and a lane that made blocked names visible by loosening
  the gate that blocked them would have measured nothing.

#
# ONLY BLOCK REASONS BELONG IN THIS MAP.  :func:`veto_reason_copy` is called from
# exactly one place — :func:`build_vetoed_rows`, which admits ``quality == "block"``
# only — so a key for a take/pending reason would be unreachable copy that no
# surface can render, and a test asserting its wording would be pinning dead code.
# The complete block set `_buy_filter` can emit is the four keys below.
#
# WHY TWO KEYS SHARE ONE SENTENCE.  Read `engine.signal_quality._confirm_legs`: both
# "failed next-bar hold" (the hk_prophet_v2 counter-trend branch, reclaim_veto=False)
# and the legacy "failed reclaim-and-hold" (the FINAL branch, reached whenever the name
# is NOT both below-200 and weekly-down) resolve on ONE test — ``held = c.iloc[i+1] >
# c.iloc[i]`` on the 3D signal frame.  Neither evaluates a 200-day reclaim at all,
# so the same sentence is the whole truth for both.
#
# ⚠ "failed reclaim-and-hold" WAS A MISLEADING ENGINE STRING — and as of 2026-08-04 the
# engine no longer emits it.  It used to render as "Reclaimed the 200-day average, then
# lost it again", narrating a 200-day round trip its branch never measured, on a name
# that may never have been near its 200-day line.  The copy was fixed first (2026-08-03)
# and the literal deliberately left alone, because renaming it changes US/CN §7 marker
# bytes to fix a copy defect.  `research/cn_prophet_audit/CN_RECLAIM_HOLD_AUDIT.md`
# §10/§11 then MEASURED the cost of leaving it: 1,094 blocks in the audit year named a
# reclaim that never ran, and 002155.SZ — 5.2% ABOVE its 200-day mean at its buy bar —
# was misread by two separate investigations because of it.  The main branch now emits
# `HOLD_FAIL`, the literal that was already correct for the identical one-test outcome.
#
# THE KEY STAYS ANYWAY.  Rows stamped before that change still carry the old string in
# the PIT candidate stores, the graded ledgers and already-rendered signal files, and
# this map is what turns a stored reason into a sentence.  Deleting the key would blank
# the copy on every historical vetoed row.  It is a RETIRED key, not a dead one.
#
# UNITS: the confirmation bar is a 3-DAY bar, not a session — `signal_frame`
# resamples to "3B" before the filter reads i+1.  The copy says "3-day bar" for
# that reason; "the next session" would be the same species of small false narrative

    """Build the vetoed lane: signals the entry gate blocked, and what happened since.

    G6's display-tier relief, and the answer to "where is the name I was looking
    for".  MEASURED on the committed 2026-07-31 panel: 48 names qualify, and five of
    the seven mega-caps the operator named are among them — each blocked on the same
    ``counter-trend, no 200-reclaim/hold`` reason, one of them (1024.HK) on a single
    marker that has now stood for 59 sessions.

    SELECTION.  Cohort members are emitted UNCONDITIONALLY — they are the names a
    reader goes looking for, and truncating them to make room for a bigger number
    would defeat the lane.  The remaining slots go to the largest move since the
    blocked marker.  Ordering inside each group is move-desc.

    ANCHOR DISCIPLINE is the ran lane's, for the same reason: a row whose age cannot
    be anchored to a marker date or a ``fresh_bars`` session count is DROPPED, never
    shown with an invented age.  ``max_sessions`` bounds staleness — a veto older
    than a quarter is no longer news about this tape.

    THE MOVE IS ANCHORED ON THE CONFIRMATION CLOSE, NOT THE MARKER (2026-08-03).  It
    used to read ``cross_read(..., cross_date=marker_date)``, which is the anchor
    ``signal_quality._buy_filter`` explicitly forbids: the marker date is the 3B
    bucket's LEFT EDGE and the label there reads two buckets forward, so it precedes
    the first close at which the block was knowable by ~8 daily sessions — and it sits
    at the trough that CREATED the signal.  MEASURED across this lane's own 48-54 name
    population (2026-07-31 and 2026-08-03 as-of dates): +7.16pp of mean overstatement.
    Xiaomi (1810.HK) printed +20.1% here; from the confirmation close the same span is
    +1.7%, and +15.9% to its peak.  That is not a rounding error, it is the pre-signal
    move, and a lane whose whole job is to hold the gate to account cannot be the one
    surface on the page that flatters its own numbers.

    So ``anchor`` now has three words and they split the row's two facts:
    ``confirm`` (date + age from the marker, move from the confirmation close),
    ``marker`` (date + age exact, move NOT derivable), ``approx`` (no marker date at
    all — age counted back from recent bars, move not derivable).  ``pct_since`` is
    non-null ONLY under ``confirm``, which is what makes a marker-anchored move
    unreachable from here rather than merely discouraged.  The age deliberately stays
    on the marker: "this block has stood for N sessions" is a claim about the block,
    and ``max_sessions`` keeps measuring the same thing it always did.

    NO ENTRY CLAIM.  These rows carry no ``entry_signal``, no priority score and no
    conviction call.  ``pct_since`` here is not a missed profit — it is the distance
    the name travelled while the board stayed out, printed so the gate can be judged.
    Because the lane ranks by that move and then truncates to ``cap``, every row also
    carries ``population`` / ``population_measured`` / ``population_median_pct`` so
    the displayed set can never be read as the whole story.

    structurally thin whenever the tape is between waves — measured 2026-08-06:
    3 eligible of 158, two cards rendered.  China Prophet solved the identical
    product problem with a lifecycle shelf: names that are NOT eligible but whose
    weekly setups are LIVE (2W washout + imminent MACD cross, fresh 1W washout
    cross...) are shown as "setup forming — get ready", zoned READY / BASING by
    :func:`engine.setup_tier.assign_ripening_zone`.  This is that shelf for HK.

    SAME LAWS AS CN:

    * zone precedence is the classifier's (FALLING veto first — those rows are
      dropped here, see the constants note), READY evidence, else BASING;
    * ordering inside each zone is Article-2: 2W-MACD bars-to-cross ascending
      (None → 999), then 1W cross age ascending (None → 99), then 2W stoch
      ascending — imminence first, zones group READY before BASING;
    * quota: READY up to ``ready_cap``, BASING fills the remainder to ``cap``.

    DISPLAY-TIER, NO ENTRY CLAIM.  Rows carry ``display_only`` and watch-words
    stance; they never enter the graded ledger and never touch buy-lane
    membership.  Everything is fail-closed: no close series, a series the setup
    floor refuses, or a classifier exception each just drop the candidate.
