"""Alt-data falsifiable ledger — what EARNS alt-data a scored vote.

Every cross-signal CONVERGENCE (a ticker lit by >=2 independent alt-data channels)
becomes a DATED, BENCHMARKED, FALSIFIABLE thesis:

    "alt-data convergence on X  =>  X beats SPY over the next ~63 trading days"

We log it on the detection day with entry levels snapshotted, then grade it vs SPY
once the window elapses — reusing the EXACT engine.ai_desk_scorer evaluators (no new
scoring code, no LLM). This is the honest path into the score / model layer: the
signal earns a vote only after the track record shows it predicts forward returns.
Until then it stays display/context-only (conviction starts 'low', never sized).

  data/altdata/theses.jsonl       append-only falsifiable theses (we own this)
  data/altdata/scored.jsonl       one outcome row per matured thesis (idempotent)
  data/altdata/track_record.json  rolling hit-rate the page + brain read back

Only SCORABLE names are logged: the ticker AND SPY must have a price series. Thin /
private vehicles (ABTC, WLFI, …) are recorded in by_ticker but never scored.

LANE GATE (HOUSE-U5 — nightly is the sole advancer of forward ledgers).
Every `data/altdata/` write above is gated on
``engine.ledger_lane.nightly_advance_enabled()`` (COLLECT_LANE=nightly, set at the
job level by daily.yml's `engine` job). `scripts.build_alt_data` — the only caller —
also runs in closing-bell.yml, earlyclose.yml, render.yml and engine-render.yml,
none of which set COLLECT_LANE; those lanes commit `git add site/` only and discard
unstaged `data/` writes, so an ungated append merely SURVIVED by their cleanup
rather than by design. closing-bell.yml's header states the premise outright ("every
engine ledger writer self-gates on it") — this module was the exception, so any lane
that stopped discarding would have double-advanced the ledger. The `site/altdata/
track_record.json` copy stays UNGATED: it is the render output every one of those
lanes exists to refresh, computed from the COMMITTED ledger.

Per-channel claim families (ALTDATA_REBOOT W2, active 2026-07-12):
  Each thesis is tagged with a claim_family based on the HIGHEST-WEIGHT channel present.
  This routes to pre-registered horizon rulers in the qledger. See research/ALTDATA_REBOOT.md.
