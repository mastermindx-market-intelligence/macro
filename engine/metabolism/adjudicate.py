"""engine.metabolism.adjudicate — ADJUDICATE row-pair core (A5, ADJUDICATE stage).

Stage 3 of the Metabolism (masterplan §1).  Two DISTINCT stateless runs rule on
each PROPOSE docket entry and write a governance ROW-PAIR — the "two-key"
(R-AUT-6): an ORCHESTRATOR run and an ADVERSARY run, each with its own run_id.

  T0 (docs/tests/display-tier/bug-fix)  → authorized on ORCHESTRATOR grant alone.
  T1/T2 (engines/collectors/UI/algo/...) → authorized only on ORCHESTRATOR grant
                                           AND ADVERSARY non-veto (both keys).

The adversary has skin in the game (R-AUT-9): its structured findings +
pre-committed tripwire predictions are appended to
data/metabolism/adversary_ledger.jsonl so VERIFY can later credit materialized
defects it flagged and debit regressions it missed.

LAWS ENFORCED HERE
------------------
* R-AUT-1  — the LLM may only DE-ESCALATE a calibrated decision, never originate
             authority.  The orchestrator's grant is ANDed with a deterministic
             case-law screen, so a proposal the screen flags (a DO_NOT_REBUILD kill
             or an ACTIVE_BUILD_MAP collision) can never be granted no matter what
             the LLM says, and the LLM's veto/deny always stands.  The screen is a
             best-effort token floor (see _deterministic_screen) — the LLM
             orchestrator, the adversary key, and the operator merge gate are the
             layers above it, not replaced by it.
* R-AUT-6  — the two-key is realized as governance row-PAIRS written by two
             different stateless run_ids, never two live sessions.
* R-AUT-9  — the adversary ledger records findings + tripwire predictions.
* Fail-closed — if the adversary run could not form an opinion (no provider,
             missing judgment), its row records veto=True; a T1/T2 proposal can
             never be authorized without a genuine second key.

Reuses engine.neuralweb.governance.append_event() (schema neuralweb.governance.v1,
NEVER-RAISE) for the row-pair, and adds two event types to its vocabulary:
    metabolism_adjudication      — orchestrator grant/deny + two_key resolution
    metabolism_adversary_review  — adversary veto/non-veto

NEVER-RAISE CONTRACT: every public function returns safe fallbacks on any error.
