"""research_vault.excerpt — the PUBLIC first-pages excerpt for the SEO pages.

This is the "flexible sampling lead-in": a verbatim, plain-text sample of a
report's OPENING pages, published OUTSIDE the paywall on
``site/research/<slug>.html`` so an exact-quote Google search — someone pasting a
sentence a news blog lifted from the PDF — matches our page. A one-line catalog
teaser can never match those queries; only the report's own words can.

The dial constants below are the entire risk surface: they trade SEO reach
against how much of a THIRD PARTY's copyrighted research we redistribute for
free. Raising them is an OPERATOR decision, never a builder default — the values
here publish a lead-in (cover + roughly the first body page), not the report.

Two halves, both never-raise:
  * ``derive()`` — pure: pdftotext body text → cleaned paragraph list;
  * ``snapshot()`` + ``write_repo_snapshot()`` — corpus.sqlite → the repo-committed
    ``data/research_vault/excerpts.json`` that the nightly render reads.

Why the repo snapshot: the corpus (and every PDF) lives ONLY in R2, and the
render path must stay R2-free. So the hourly ingest job snapshots excerpts into
git exactly like it snapshots catalog.json. Serialization is deterministic and
TIMESTAMP-FREE so that hourly job only produces a git diff when the CONTENT
changed — a stamped payload would commit-churn 24×/day. stdlib only.

    Emails, URLs and phone numbers go first (a cover-page contact block and its

    indexed — stripping only the email would still publish the analyst's direct
    line), then all whitespace runs — pdftotext ``-layout`` leaves column
    padding — collapse to single spaces. Phones run BEFORE that collapse so a
    number broken across the layout's own spacing is still one match.

    ``_PHONE_RE`` only PROPOSES a match; it is stripped only when it carries ≥9
    digits. A real phone number carries 10-11+ (country/area code plus the line),
    while the same shape of digits-and-separators is also how a report writes the
    figures it is ABOUT: an ISO date (``2026-07-25``) has 8 digits and a year
    range (``2025-2026``) has 8, so both survive verbatim. The floor is set where

    SEO page. Losing an hour of new excerpts is cheap; losing all of them is not.

    ALSO REFUSES A COLLAPSE, not merely an empty read. The empty-only test was
    the whole guard until 2026-08-07, and it is not what the sentence above
    promises: on 2026-08-06 22:39 a partial corpus of 2 documents passed it and
    overwrote a committed snapshot of 912, blanking the excerpt block on ~900
    public report pages. A degraded restore rarely returns exactly nothing — it
    returns a handful — so "empty" is the one shape the failure almost never
    takes. The floor below is proportional for that reason.

    Shrinking is legitimate (a doc can be withdrawn), so this is a FLOOR, not an
    equality check: a write is refused only when the incoming corpus holds less
    than ``_COLLAPSE_FLOOR`` of what is already committed. An unreadable or
    absent committed snapshot means there is nothing to protect, so the write
    proceeds — the guard never blocks a first write or a genuine rebuild.
