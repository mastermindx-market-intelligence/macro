"""engine.research_vault.slugs — deterministic report-id -> URL-slug derivation.

Extracted from scripts/build_research_pages.py so that consumers which only need
the slug mapping (engine/chronicle/adapters.py builds each vault event's
``links.site`` from it) can import it WITHOUT dragging in the page renderer's
import closure.

The concrete failure: that adapter's import is FAIL-SOFT, and the renderer
imported jinja2 at module scope. ci.yml's ``chronicle-suite`` installs only
``pytest pandas numpy pyarrow pyyaml`` (replayed by the ci-pack orchestrator),
so there the ImportError was swallowed and every rebuilt vault event carried
``links.site=None`` — a rebuild in that lane produced genuinely different bytes
than a rebuild anywhere jinja2 exists, which reddened the store-vs-rebuild gate.
The committed store was never corrupted (the nightly runner has jinja2; all 105
committed vault events carry a populated link) — the divergence was in the CI
rebuild, which is precisely what a rebuild gate compares against.

Deferring the renderer's jinja2 import into ``build()`` (#3648) fixed that one
dependency. This module closes the class: whatever the renderer imports at
module scope in future, the adapter no longer sees it.

MUST stay stdlib-only (its one relative import, sidecar, is json/re/unicodedata):
anything heavier re-creates exactly the failure this module exists to remove, and
the fail-soft would hide it again. Slugs are public indexed URLs
(``/research/<slug>.html``) — any change here moves them, so the functions are
moved verbatim, not rewritten.
