"""research_vault.title — recover a report's REAL title from a PDF FILENAME one.

Some upstream desks hand us a sidecar whose ``title`` is just the source PDF's
filename, prettified: ``2026_07_24_Rearming_Britains_Supply_Side_en.pdf`` arrives
as ``"2026 07 24 Rearming Britain's Supply Side en"``. That title is a *valid*
sidecar field — ``needs_metadata`` stays False — so the ingest ladder in
``sidecar.normalize`` has nothing to fall back FROM; the bad title is simply
believed. It then flows to ``templates/research_report.html.j2`` as the
``<title>``/``<h1>``/``og:title`` of the report's SEO landing page, which is the
one thing those pages exist to get right: someone Googling the exact report title
must land on us, and a prettified filename matches nothing anyone ever types.

So this module adds a rung to the ladder that distrusts a *shape* rather than an
absence — the same move ``sidecar._looks_truncated`` already makes for MarketDesk's
dropped ``.EX)`` suffix:

  1. :func:`clean` strips filename furniture (leading date stamps, trailing
     language tokens + document ids, ``(1)`` duplicate-download markers). A title
     that cleans to itself was never filename-derived — that is exactly what
     :func:`looks_filename_derived` reports, so detector and repair can never
     drift apart.
  2. :func:`recover` looks the cleaned title up in the report's own first page
     (the body text ingest already extracts with ``pdftotext``) and returns the
     properly punctuated, properly cased headline the PDF prints.

Recovery is ANCHORED, never generative: it only ever returns a span of a line that
starts with the cleaned title's own words, in order. It cannot invent a headline —
the worst it can do is return the words we already had. Every gate below fails
CLOSED to the cleaned title, which is still strictly better than the filename.

Pure + stdlib-only (no I/O, no PDF library) so both callers share one algorithm:
``ingest._ingest_one`` for new documents, and ``ingest._repair_titles`` for the
ones already in the catalog — which is the only way a fix reaches them, since
ingest skips every PDF that already has a receipt.
