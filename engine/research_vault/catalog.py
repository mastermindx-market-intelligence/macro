Items are the public-safe subset of a normalized sidecar (NO body text — search
lives in corpus.sqlite). Items are sorted newest-first by ``published_at``. This
is the ONLY research artifact that carries publicly-visible content; the PDFs
themselves are never public.

The catalog lives in the store at ``research_vault/catalog.json`` and is also
snapshotted to the repo at ``data/research_vault/catalog.json`` by the ingest
job (so the nightly render can SSR-bake without R2). Writes are atomic. Pure over
its ``catalog`` dict argument; only :func:`load`/:func:`write` touch the store.

# :func:`load` below is deliberately fail-SOFT and stays that way for the repair

# converts "the authoritative catalog is missing/corrupt" into a document that is
# indistinguishable from "the vault legitimately holds zero reports", and a
# successful read of an arbitrarily OLD object into something the browser labels
# "Updated hourly".
#
# Everything below is the strict counterpart. Its rules:
#   * unavailable ≠ absent — the store read goes through ``get_bytes_strict``,
#     whose ``None`` means only "the backing service authoritatively reported this
#     key does not exist" (r2_store §StrictReadStore);
#   * freshness is read from the PRODUCER clock (``generated_at``), never from a
#     successful HTTP status and never from the newest item's ``published_at`` —
#     the hourly run rewrites the catalog even when it admits no new report, so
#     ``generated_at`` is the only clock that ticks every hour;
#   * a legitimately EMPTY vault (valid schema, recent clock, ``items: []``) is a
#     FRESH catalog, not a failure — that distinction is the whole point.

# A catalog older than this is still usable as last-known data, but may never be

# two hours is one whole missed cycle plus a full hour of grace).

      1. the document is an object carrying the exact expected ``schema``;

         string ``id`` — the catalog's whole job at the serving tier is to say
         which ids are admitted, so an item we cannot identify invalidates the
         answer rather than being skipped;

      4. the producer clock is not materially in the future — SERVING ONLY, see
         ``check_future_clock``.

    ``check_future_clock`` and ``check_items`` are both False for the INGEST path,
    and each asymmetry is deliberate:

    * **the future-clock rule is a SERVING rule.** It exists because a tier that
      cannot trust the producer clock cannot make an honest freshness claim from
      it. Ingest makes no freshness claim — it REWRITES ``generated_at`` with its
      own clock on the next publish — so a timestamp ahead of this runner says
      nothing about whether the item set is trustworthy. Enforcing it there would
      convert ordinary clock skew between two self-hosted runners into a refused
      publish over a mature vault: an outage worse than the drift, and one that
      self-heals on the very next publish anyway.
    * **per-row validation is a SERVING rule.** The serving tier's whole job is to
      answer "which ids are admitted", so a row it cannot identify makes the
      answer unknown. Ingest is rebuilding the document, and one unidentifiable
      row truncates nothing — every other row republishes unchanged and the
      downstream passes already survive it. Refusing there would recreate the
      "one bad document kills the batch" failure the ingest module exists to
      avoid. What ingest DOES gate on is starting from zero rows over a vault
      with history, which is the only input that actually loses data.

    Deliberately NOT checked on either path: ``count`` against ``len(items)`` and
    the ``institutions`` list. Both are derived fields that :func:`_reindex`
    rewrites on every publish, so a disagreement is a stale-derivation nit, not
    evidence that the item set is untrustworthy — and the serving tier reads the
    items themselves. Raising on those would turn cosmetic drift into an outage.
