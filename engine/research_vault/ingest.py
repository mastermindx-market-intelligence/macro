"""research_vault.ingest — the hourly, idempotent ingestion pipeline (§7).

For each new PDF in ``research_inbox/`` (one whose receipt
``research_inbox/_processed/<id>.json`` is absent):

  1. fetch pdf + sidecar (store GET, private bucket),
  2. normalize the sidecar to the v1 contract (fallbacks; never drop),
  3. extract body text via ``pdftotext -layout`` (30s timeout; graceful empty),
  4. measure the deterministic facts (probe.py: pages, content hash, text-layer
     density, PDF provenance) — these OVERRIDE sidecar claims for the same field,
  5. recover the real title when the sidecar gave us the PDF's FILENAME (title.py),
  6. promote the PDF → ``research_vault/<id>.pdf`` — a FAILED put fails the ITEM
     (no catalog row, no corpus row, no receipt) so the vault can never admit a
     report whose canonical object is absent,
  7. upsert the catalog row + FTS corpus row (title/summary/body/institution/date),
  8. write the receipt ``research_inbox/_processed/<id>.json``.

Publication is ordered corpus → catalog → receipts → repo mirror, and each step
gates the next. The catalog is the VISIBILITY COMMIT: a report becomes public
exactly when the catalog publish succeeds, which is why receipts (that make a
document unre-ingestable) and the git mirror may only advance behind it.

Receipted PDFs are never re-ingested, so three passes over the ALREADY-published
catalog/corpus are the only way a later correction ever reaches them:
:func:`_repair_titles` re-derives filename-shaped titles,
:func:`_refresh_sidecars` re-reads the sidecar of any row still missing
``summary_points``/``tags``/``tickers``/``desk`` — the upstream desk writes those
asynchronously, well after the PDF itself lands — and
:func:`_reextract_bodies` re-runs ``pdftotext`` over the vault PDF of any row whose
body never extracted because the HOST was broken at ingest time.

Every per-item step is wrapped so ONE bad document can never abort the batch
(never-raise-per-item); the whole run is idempotent (a re-run ingests 0). A
``top_pick`` is honored from the sidecar ``top_pick:true`` OR the
``research_inbox/top_picks/`` prefix. Returns a summary dict.

The pdftotext extractor is copied verbatim from ``collectors/hk_cbbc_sld.py``
(tmpfile, -layout, 30s timeout, UTF-8, graceful None).

    """Re-extract the body of published rows whose text never made it in.

    WHY this exists — the THIRD published-row repair, sibling to
    :func:`_repair_titles` and :func:`_refresh_sidecars`: receipts freeze an
    ingest-time MISTAKE as permanently as they freeze an ingest-time success. On
    2026-07-30 the ``macstudio-light`` runner label moved to a Mac without poppler,
    so ``shutil.which("pdftotext")`` failed in every hourly run for two days; each
    document ingested in that window was published with ``body=''`` and the honest
    ``text_layer='unavailable'`` stamp, was receipted, and could never re-ingest.
    127 rows were still bodyless when the host was healed — invisible to body
    search, and served to the Mastermind full-report reader as excerpt-only.
    ``unavailable`` is exactly the state that says "we know nothing about this
    document because OUR tool was broken", so it is the state a repair pass can
    act on without touching a single document-level fact.

    Candidacy is read from the CORPUS, not the catalog: ``text_layer`` is a
    server-side measured column (§5b keeps it out of the public catalog), so the
    corpus row is the only place the fault is recorded. ``text_layer IS NULL``
    rows join the queue behind them — they predate the probe entirely and carry no
    measured facts at all — but they are ordered LAST because, unlike the
    ``unavailable`` rows, they are not user-visibly broken.

    Load-bearing rules:

    - **Fill-only for ``body``.** A row that already holds text keeps it
      byte-for-byte; only an empty/NULL body is written. A NULL-``text_layer`` row
      is usually a fine pre-v2 row that simply was never measured, and re-extraction
      must not be allowed to shorten (or otherwise rewrite) text already published.
    - **Facts are ALWAYS stamped** (every measured value, not just the body). Even
      a scan-only PDF gets its measured columns, which re-classifies it to
      ``text_layer='none'`` — the honest "this document has no text" state — and
      drops it out of candidacy forever. That is the quiescence mechanism, and it
      is what lets a consumer tell "no text exists" apart from "text unreachable
      right now". A fact that came back UNKNOWN (None/'') is the one thing not
      written: on an already-published row that would delete a value rather than
      correct one.
    - **A missing vault PDF leaves the row COMPLETELY untouched.** Absence of the
      object is not evidence about the document, so stamping "none" over it would
      manufacture a fact out of a storage gap.
    - **A still-dead tool aborts the WHOLE pass at the first candidate.** If
      ``extract_pdf_text`` returns None the host is broken again; every further
      GET would burn bandwidth to learn the same thing, and no row may be stamped
      from an extraction that never ran.
    - **A plain UPDATE, never delete+insert.** The ``rv_docs_au`` trigger keeps the
      FTS postings in sync, so the re-extracted body becomes searchable in place.

    Returns ``{checked, bodies, facts_only, pdf_missing, remaining,
    aborted_tool_unavailable}``; ``remaining`` is the candidate count beyond the
    cap (0 = the backlog is drained). Never raises — a repair is never worth
    failing the hourly job — and never-raise-per-item, so one unreadable PDF
    cannot stop the pass.

    catalog, on the stated theory that a later ingest would heal it. That theory
    is false here, because ingest is receipt-idempotent: with ~1,400 historical
    PDFs already receipted, every one of them is SKIPPED, so a run that starts
    from empty admits only the handful of genuinely new PDFs and republishes a
    catalog of count≈2 with a brand-new ``generated_at``. Storage corruption
    would become fresh, authoritative, published data loss.

    **RECEIPTS are the trigger, and the reason is mechanical.** A rebuild from
    zero is safe exactly when every document the vault exposes will be re-admitted
    by the pass, and the pass admits precisely "inbox PDFs without a receipt". So
    a receipted document is the one thing a rebuild provably drops. A promoted
    vault PDF or a corpus row WITHOUT a receipt is re-ingested normally — that is
    the ordinary state left behind by a run whose receipts did not flush, and
    gating on it would wedge a brand-new vault forever the first time a publish
    failed, converting a transient error into a permanent operator ticket.

    Both are still COUNTED, because an operator reading the refusal needs to see
    the scale of what was protected — and because vault PDFs or corpus rows with
    ZERO receipts is itself anomalous (receipts do not delete themselves), which
    is reported as a loud warning rather than silently ignored.

        restored locally; publishing would clobber it with a truncated rebuild.
      * ``error='corpus_publish_failed'`` / ``'catalog_publish_failed'`` — the
        publication commit did not complete. ``corpus_published`` /
        ``catalog_published`` say exactly how far it got, and
        ``receipts_unflushed`` counts the documents that stayed unreceipted (they
        re-ingest next run).

    A per-DOCUMENT failure is NOT a plane failure: it increments ``failed`` and
    the batch continues. That asymmetry is deliberate — one malformed PDF must
    never red the hourly lane, and a failed publish must never be green.

    ``coverage`` is the per-field fill rate over the final catalog

    the counts still report what a real run WOULD do. The one pass a dry run does
    not perform at all is :func:`_reextract_bodies`: it is pure mutation of rows

    #
    # The authoritative catalog is read FAIL-CLOSED. What this gate protects
    # against is precisely ONE thing: starting from zero rows and republishing a
    # catalog that has LOST the vault's history. Ingest is receipt-idempotent, so
    # every historical PDF is skipped — a run that starts empty admits only the
    # handful of genuinely new documents and publishes count≈2 with a fresh
    # generated_at, turning storage corruption into authoritative data loss.
    #
    # TWO different inputs reach that same catastrophe, and both are gated here:
    #   * the catalog is unavailable (missing / malformed JSON / wrong schema /
    #     items not a list / undatable), and
    #   * the catalog is structurally VALID but carries zero items — a corrupted
    #     object can perfectly well parse to an empty item list, and that path
    #     would otherwise sail straight through validation into the same loss.
    #
    # Per-ROW junk is deliberately NOT gated (``check_items=False``). One
    # unidentifiable row does not truncate anything: the other ~1,400 rows are
    # intact and republish unchanged, the downstream passes already survive a
    # malformed row, and refusing over it would recreate exactly the "one bad
    # document kills the batch" failure this whole module is built to avoid.
    # Strict per-row validation belongs to the SERVING tier, whose job is to
    # answer "which ids are admitted" and which therefore cannot tolerate a row it
    # cannot identify. Same reasoning for ``check_future_clock=False``: ingest
    # makes no freshness claim and rewrites generated_at on the next publish, so
