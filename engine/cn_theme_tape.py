"""CN Theme Tape — theme cycle state × member board states × why-not attributions.

Charter: research/CHINA_PROPHET_LOSER_INTELLIGENCE_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md §5 W-C
("CN Theme Tape on china_stocks reusing the US W2 pattern (#4488) — theme heat ×
member states × why-not attributions, glance-tier, zh parity").

WHAT THIS CLOSES. The operator incident of 2026-08-04: Gold Miners showed as the
top sector on several boards, and the china_stocks page said NOTHING about why it
carried no picks. Answering it took a forensic session. The facts were all in
artifacts the page already builds — the basket was in an early turn, its members
were held out upstream, and each had a specific reason. This module joins them so
the page states it at a glance.

IT IS AN ACCOUNTING, NOT A LEADERBOARD — the same distinction the US tape draws.
Heat does not decide who shows; the CYCLE does, because "the sector turned before
its names did" is the fact the incident was about. Every member of a shown theme
lands in exactly one bucket, so a row adds up to the theme's whole membership, and
a theme with zero picks still gets a row that says so. A panel that only spoke when
it had a pick would reproduce the silence it exists to fix.

DISPLAY TIER, ZERO AUTHORITY. Nothing here ranks, gates or sizes anything. It reads
finished nightly artifacts and re-states them; it originates no signal and changes
no board row. The board below is byte-identical with this panel present or absent.

WHY THE CANDIDATES LEDGER AND NOT THE BOARD. `china_standouts.json` is the BOARD —
what made it. On 2026-08-05 not one of Gold Miners' six members appears anywhere in
that file, so a board-only join renders "6/6 quiet" and narrates nothing: the exact
silence again, one layer down. `data/china_prophet_rank/candidates.parquet` is the
full considered universe WITH its `gate_reason`, which is where the answer lives
(湖南黄金 → "veto: bearish divergence"). Same nightly producer, already committed,
read-only here.

`gate_reasons` (plural) is computed in-memory by engine/china_prophet_shadow.py and
never written to disk; `gate_reason` (singular) is the persisted column. Both were
named as candidate sources in the build brief — only the singular one exists.

SOURCES (all fail-open; a missing one drops its own chip, never the tape):
  data/baskets_china/membership.json        basket -> members, etf_proxy
  data/china_sector_cycles/forward_log.pq   kind == 'basket' -> phase, osc_slope

#: Hard ceiling on rows, not a ranking depth — see `build_cn_theme_tape` for why the
#: row SET is defined by a condition rather than sliced off the top of a ranking.
MAX_ROWS = 10

#: The board's own continuation-watch cohort. Empty until the nightly lane starts
#: appending; a zero-row read is a normal state, never an error.
CONTINUATION_BOARD = "cn_continuation_watch_v1"

#: How stale the flow desk may be before its chip is dropped. `site/flowdata/desk.json`
#: declares a DAILY cadence, so a week is already generous; on 2026-08-05 it stood at
#: 2026-07-24 (12 days) and the chip correctly does not render. The budget is a
#: freshness gate, not a feature flag — the chip lights up on its own once the lane
#: is healthy again, with nothing here to change.
FLOW_MAX_AGE_DAYS = 7

#: The cycle, in cycle order. This is the rail's geometry AND the phase vocabulary in
#: one object, so the two can never disagree about how many positions there are or
#: which one a theme sits on.
#:
#: The engine's own enum values (Trough/Recovery/Expansion/Peak/Downturn) are internal
#: vocabulary and never reach the glance tier — DESIGN_DOCTRINE Law 2 bans the desk's
#: enum printed character-for-character on a primary surface. The plain words below are
#: the ONE live definition of that mapping. A dead `PHASE_ZH` map exists in
#: templates/sector_central_china.html.j2 (defined, never consumed by any code); it is
#: not a second source of truth and was not copied — its "Recovery → 入场良机" reads as
#: a buy instruction, which is precisely what a cycle STATE must not do.

EARLY_TURN = "Recovery"

#: The five buckets, in "most actionable first" order — a member is counted once, at
#: its most actionable state, so the row sums to the theme's membership.

#: `gate_reason` (the persisted why-not prose) -> bucket + plain bilingual words.

#: WHY "counter-trend, no 200-reclaim/hold" IS QUIET AND NOT BLOCKED. It is the single
#: most common value in the ledger (450 of 1,667 rows on 2026-08-05) — it says the name
#: is simply below its trend line and no setup exists yet. Bucketed as `blocked` it made
#: that column read 10/11/14 on nearly every row: a constant, and Law 4 is explicit that
#: a constant is not a signal. As `quiet` with one shared reason it is honest and the
#: `blocked` column goes back to meaning what the reader thinks it means — this name was
#: actively held out — which on Gold Miners leaves exactly 湖南黄金 standing, the name
#: the operator asked about.
#:
#: Keys are the engine's exact strings. An unrecognised one is NOT guessed at: it takes
#: the generic chip and the raw text rides the hover, because a raw machine string on the
#: glance tier is a documented doctrine violation, not a graceful degradation. The same
#: rule templates/china.html.j2's `_CN_MK` map already follows for lane reasons.
