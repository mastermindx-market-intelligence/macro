"""Forward shadow book — the institutional measurement floor (research/INSTITUTIONAL_ROADMAP.md
keystone). The traded score has never been graded on REALIZED forward returns; an in-sample
or even walk-forward backtest still overstates, because the only honest test of a live score
is to FREEZE it at build time and grade it once the forward window has fully elapsed.

Three pure functions, append-only, leak-free by construction:

  snapshot(date, recs)  — append (date, ticker, score, percentile, regime, pct_basis)
                          frozen at the build date `t`. Append-only + dedup by (date,
                          ticker): a nightly rebuild never overwrites or backfills history.
  mature(asof, closes)  — join only rows whose horizon has FULLY ELAPSED (the h-th trading
                          bar after `date` exists in `closes` AND its date <= asof) to the
                          realized forward return. The elapsed-horizon guard is the whole
                          point: a horizon that has not closed is NEVER graded.
  grade(matured)        — rolling forward rank-IC + ic_summary (IC-IR, HAC-t) + Clark-West
                          vs an expanding-mean benchmark, per horizon, using engine.validation.

Honest expectation (stated up front): given the committed factor scorecard (composite IC
~0, only payout survives FDR, all on the optimistic survivor bound), the forward book will
most likely show the cross-sectional score's realized forward IC ≈ 0 after a few quarters —
and KNOWING that is the institutional win, not a loss. The book is also a survivor-only
OPTIMISTIC bound (free prices serve listed names); that caveat ships on every artifact.
