"""China predictive-validation harness — forward-return scorecard for the China signal legs.

LEAF · CONTEXT-ONLY · keyless · never raises into a build. The keystone Stage-3 honesty
layer: for every China signal that is RECONSTRUCTABLE from stored history it measures
whether the signal actually predicted forward returns, using the SAME institutional
primitives the US/vector calibrators use (engine.validation — imported and called VERBATIM,
never re-derived: rank_ic, ic_summary, newey_west_tstat, incremental_ic, benjamini_hochberg).

Signal families, each reconstructed from what is actually on disk today:

  * fundflow         — per-name 主力 (超大+大单) net inflow rate (GATED Tushare moneyflow_dc), a
                      CROSS-SECTIONAL signal validated like valuation off the accrued history in
                      data/tushare/flow_hist.parquet (collectors/tushare_history backfills it from
                      the paid history). sign_expected +1 (inflow → continuation). `accruing` when
                      the token / history is absent.
  * chips            — per-name 获利比例 win-rate (GATED Tushare cyq_perf), same cross-sectional path
                      off data/tushare/chips_hist.parquet. sign_expected −1 (euphoric → contrarian).
  * guidance         — 业绩预告 earnings-guidance surprise (GATED Tushare forecast), cross-sections
                      keyed by ann_date off data/tushare/forecast_hist.parquet. sign_expected +1
                      (positive guidance → post-announcement drift).


  * valuation       — per-name P/E·P/B own-history percentile (cheap = low pctile). A
                      CROSS-SECTIONAL signal → daily cross-sectional rank-IC vs each name's
                      forward CSI-300-relative return, summarized over a date grid, plus an
                      incremental-IC neutralization against {momentum_252, reversal_21, size}
                      (the honest "is value just reversal?" number — A-share value Sharpe is
                      known negative, so the leg is EXPECTED to wash out / validate wrong-sign).
  * margin          — whole-market financing balance as a share of float (fin_pct_float). A
                      MARKET-WIDE timing series, NOT a cross-section → validated as a market
                      timer: signed forward CSI-300 return regressed on the leg, pooled
                      Newey-West HAC t (high leverage = contrarian risk → sign_expected -1).
  * news_sentiment  — blended CCTV+wire media-sentiment z-score. Also MARKET-WIDE → same
                      market-timer path (rich sentiment = contrarian fade → sign_expected -1).

Forward returns come from the wide panel data/china_search/closes.parquet (cols = tickers),
benched to CSI 300 (510300.SS, resolved via store.read because it is NOT a panel column).
Leakage-guarded throughout: every forward return is measured PAST→FUTURE only, and a date
is only scored once the panel actually covers its forward end (mirrors china_radar_ledger._fwd_rel).

Anything without enough reconstructable history degrades to status "accruing" (n_obs 0) — the
conviction/hub LEDGERS (snapshot-forward) are the rigorous path that accrues from go-live.

SAMPLING CADENCE — why N is not a row count (2026-07-25)
-------------------------------------------------------
The fundflow/chips stores were designed as a WEEKLY grid (collectors/tushare_history._GRID_WEEKS
= 52) and this harness was written against that assumption. They are no longer weekly: `_grid_dates`
is tail-anchored (``idx[-260:][::5]``), so its stride phase-shifts by one trading day per build and
the append-only store accreted every phase. Measured 2026-07-25, flow_hist/chips_hist hold 273
distinct dates from 2025-05-26 to 2026-07-20 — a median gap of 1 trading day, ~20 dates/month where
a weekly grid would give ~4. forecast_hist (guidance) is event-keyed and likewise sub-weekly.

Consequences, and what this module does about each:

  * IC POINT ESTIMATES are unaffected. A cross-sectional rank-IC is invariant to any common
    per-date additive offset, so the finer grid changes only how often the same forward window
    is re-measured, not what it measures. Nothing here corrects them.
  * SIGNIFICANCE was inflated. Cross-sections one trading day apart share (h-1)/h of their
    forward window, so the per-date IC series is an MA(~h) process. The harness passed
    ``periods_per_year=12`` to ic_summary, which truncates Newey-West at 6 lags — right for a
    weekly grid at h<=21, but ~3x too few at daily h=21 and ~10x too few at h=63. Measured
    inflation on the live store: 1.1x at h=21, and 1.73x at h=63 (fundflow t 3.075 -> 1.772,
    crossing the |t|>=2 gate). Lags are now sized to the MEASURED cadence (`_hac_lags_for`).
  * N was inflated ~5x. `n_obs` counted scored rows: 272 where the design intended ~52, against
    a `_MIN_PROVEN_N` of 40 — a gate that could no longer bind on any grid this dense. The same
    14 months hold 56 distinct weeks and, at the headline 21d horizon, only 13 non-overlapping
    forward windows (4 at h=63). Promotion now gates on those honest counts; every horizon block
    prints `n_weeks`, `n_indep`, `sampling_step_td`, `hac_lags` and `overlap_ratio` alongside `n`.

The collector is deliberately left alone: the accreted daily panel is MORE data for the point
estimates and costs nothing to keep — it was only the inference that was wrong. See the
horizon-config comment in engine/flow_velocity.py (PR #3561) for the collector-side write-up.

validate_all() writes data/china_validation/scorecard.json (schema china_validation.v1) and
returns the same dict. Every public fn returns plain data / None and NEVER raises.

        - Without the history: the live series has only ~19 points → n_obs stays 0.

    PIT-correctness note: the history baseline is computed from PAST data only; the live
    series is z-scored using (raw − baseline_μ) / baseline_σ where μ/σ come from the full
    10-year smoothed series — there is no forward leakage because the history ends before
    the live series begins (the backfill covers 2016-02 → ~today, the live series covers
    the most recent ~19 broadcast days, and the z-score denominator is fixed at build time
