"""Evidence-bound cash-deal economics for the Special Situations desk (F09-1 — context only).

For an announced fixed-CASH acquisition, tender offer or going-private the premium and the
spread are directly observable facts of a public filing — but only if every number can name
the filing bytes it came from. This module is the ONE pure owner (no IO) of:

  * `special_situations.deal_term_observation.v1` — immutable, source-bound term observations
    carrying exact evidence locators (document, character offsets, excerpt digest) and
    amendment/correction lineage;
  * deterministic extraction of those observations from public EDGAR filing text, which may
    decline coverage but must never publish a false precise value;
  * the current-term compiler (accession/amendment precedence, conflict detection);
  * `reduce_cash_deal()` — the single closed calculation/eligibility contract every consumer
    uses, returning four SEPARATELY NAMED numbers plus a typed quality state;
  * `select_ordered_context()` — the single ordered-projection owner shared by
    `mastermind_emit()` and `special_sits_intel.build_context_feed()`.

Three rules the previous lane broke, and why they are enforced here rather than downstream:

1. A model has ZERO numeric authority. `llm_terms` are candidate/context only (`parse_terms`);
   a number reaches a consumer only through an observation bound to source bytes.
2. Missingness never becomes a number. A month-only close stays a window with
   `days_to_close=None`; it is never resolved to month-end and then annualized.
3. No clamp, no cap, no ticker exception. An absurd spread is a symptom of a stale price, a
   terminal deal or a mis-extracted term — each of which now has its own visible state — so
   the fix is the receipt, not a band that hides the number.

Nothing here is scored, ranked as a signal, or sized. `is_signal` is False by construction.

# WILL RECEIVE $9.00 in cash per share", and "the PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED MERGER providing for
# $21.00". Those are current transactions by any reading; only the phrasing was uncovered.

# still requires an explicit anchor, so scope remains something the document asserts. Restoring
# the fallback would instead make DOCUMENT ORDER the authority. A missing phrase is a recall

       supersession edges out from that accession's own rows. The previous version admitted the
       whole multi-accession bucket the moment ANY supersession matched ANY id in it, so one
       lawful amendment link legalized an unrelated third accession sitting in the same bucket.
       A lineage is not a bucket that happens to contain one real edge.
