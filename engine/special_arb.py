"""Merger-arb spread math for the Special Situations desk (P1.2 — display-only).

For announced cash / cash+stock Acquisitions, Tender Offers and Going-Privates the
SPREAD (deal price vs the live price), its annualized return, and days-to-close is a
classic, directly observable event-driven datum — and the weekly digest does not
compute it. This module is PURE (no IO): it normalizes the deal terms the LLM lane
(P1.1) extracted, and turns (deal_price, live_price, expected_close) into spread /
annualized / downside-on-break numbers. The engine supplies the live + unaffected
prices; nothing here is scored or sized — it is context the desk and Mastermind read.
