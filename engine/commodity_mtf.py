"""Multi-timeframe cycle-ladder + technical confluence for the Commodity Vector.

Ports the macro dashboard's MOMENTUM + TECHNICAL methodology (engine.cycles) into
the commodity page so each commodity is read with the SAME calibrated cycle-ladder
/ multi-timeframe engine the stock analyzer runs. On top of
cycles.analyze(close, high, kind="equity") it:
  * adds BIWEEKLY (2W) + MONTHLY (ME) technical timeframes (so D/3D/W/2W/ME),
  * derives a single CONFLUENCE VERDICT that reconciles a short-term bounce with
    the bigger-picture trend (the "counter-trend bounce vs investment buy"
    distinction) — and FUSES each commodity's own MEASURED calibration so the
    verdict honours per-asset polarity.

Two deliberate divergences from engine/btc_mtf.py (the Bitcoin Vector precedent):
  * kind="equity", not "crypto" — gold/silver/copper/oil trade on exchange
    calendars with 36-42 *trading*-day daily cycles (the equity preset), not the
    56-70 *calendar*-day crypto band. The long timeframes anchor on Friday
    (2W-FRI) to match the equity weekly bar (cycles.mtf_snapshot uses W-FRI).
  * confluence_verdict() folds this commodity's calibrated structural signals
    (driver axis + 12-month trend) into the bigger-picture governor,
    POLARITY-CORRECTED. So the verdict can never call an oil up-trend "bullish"
    (oil's 12-mo trend mean-reverts) or a supportive gold backdrop a buy (gold's
    driver is contrarian). The cycle-ladder timing TAPE stays asset-agnostic — it
    is the same calibrated equity engine, judged on timing/drawdown.

Recomputed each build, never persisted. Returns {} on any failure so a short or
broken series can't break the page build.
