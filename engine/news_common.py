"""Shared news infrastructure — source tiers, quality scoring, the entity map.

LEAF · CONTEXT-ONLY. Imports nothing from the mechanical scoring core
(conditions/regime/run/inputs/equity_alloc) and nothing in the scoring path
imports it. Every public function returns plain data and NEVER raises into the
build — all network/parse/IO failures degrade gracefully.

This module is the *single source of truth* the whole news suite shares:

  • SOURCE_TIERS  — one reputable-outlet allowlist, tiered (wire → quality →
    aggregator), reused by every feed (macro / financial / narrative). A superset
    of the legacy macro_news allowlist (kept byte-compatible there).
  • quality_score — the deterministic 0-100 ranking every feed sorts by:
        tier-weight × (theme/entity relevance) × recency-decay − clickbait
    No AI. The optional LLM layer (engine/news_llm) only *re-ranks/summarises*
    on top of this; it never gates a headline in or out on its own.
  • build_entity_map — derives, from data/baskets/membership.json + the sector
    ETFs in config + data/profile/profiles.parquet, the ticker → {name, baskets,
    sectors, mag7} map and a high-precision alias map used to tag free-text news
    (GDELT) to entities. Ticker-tagged providers (Polygon/Finnhub) carry their
    own tags and skip this.

Nothing here is ever a scoring input. "Quality" ranks display order; it is not
a trade signal.

W2 DELEGATION NOTE: norm_title / event_id / source_tier / is_blocked /
is_allowlisted / tier_label / recency_weight are thin shims that delegate to
engine.qkernel — the ONE canonical implementation. The signatures are kept
byte-compatible with all existing callers (see compat notes on each function).
