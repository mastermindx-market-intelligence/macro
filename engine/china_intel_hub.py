"""CHINA INTELLIGENCE HUB — the China command apparatus.

Mirror of engine/intel_hub.py for China names.  Fuses five per-ticker legs
(news · altdata convergence · divergence radar sector→member crosswalk ·
stocks-board membership · special-situations flags) into an EDGE-REMAINING-
ranked command list, plus four off-desk discovery lanes.

INTELLIGENCE_HUB_V2 rulings are LAW here (masterplan R-2):
  • Sort key: (edge_remaining-weighted opportunity, conviction)
  • LEADING desks: altdata + radar.  LAGGING: news + board.
  • leading_gap = lead_up − lag_up; gap_mult = 1 + 0.15×clamp(gap, -2, +2)
  • opportunity = signal_core × falsifier_penalty × edge_remaining × gap_mult
  • NO term may reward raw agreement count
  • 5-desk-agree RANKS BELOW 2-leading-desk + high-edge by design

Price veto: a name rolling over (20d return < VETO_RETURN_THRESH and RS falling)
is staged "faltering" — never "emerging" or "early".

CONTEXT-ONLY · DEGRADE-NEVER-RAISE · display-only until gauntleted.

    health.status == "upstream_degraded" (P1-R1: the same-run china_filings
    refresh this collection's china_visits derivation consumed was itself
    degraded) never routes into the source_failure branch — the visit tape
    history is still readable and stays visible. With no rows for this name
    it reads like a stale refusal instead of a clean "measured_no_event": a
    degraded upstream proves no absence. Rows present render normally either
    way — positive evidence from a degraded run is real evidence.

    P1-R3: an OPEN coverage exception (durable, company-scoped memory for "we
    observed source evidence relevant to this company but could not
    canonically admit it") suppresses `measured_no_event` PER COMPANY
    (`scoped = code in exception_codes`) or, when the excluded observation's
    company could not even be identified, PLANE-WIDE (`unscoped =
    unscoped_exceptions > 0 or not exceptions_readable` — an unreadable
    ledger fails closed exactly like an unscoped exception, never like "no
    exceptions"). This routes to the existing "not_yet_available" state
    (already in the house ten-state taxonomy, already documented in
    collectors/china_visits.py) rather than minting a new one. visit_ctx
    keys absent entirely (a caller building the dict by hand without them)
    degrade to the pre-P1-R3 behavior — no scoping, no coverage_exception.

    NO-ROWS PRECEDENCE (FIX, correction 2026-08-22): the scoped/unscoped
    coverage-exception branch is evaluated BEFORE the generic
    "upstream_degraded" branch, not after — it is strictly MORE SPECIFIC.
    "A visit filing was observed for this company but could not be read"
    is actionable; "upstream was degraded" is the generic fallback, and it
    is also FALSE ON THE FACTS for the ledger-present-but-unreadable cause
    (nothing upstream degraded — a SIDECAR ledger was unreadable, transport
    was fine). Both branches block measured_no_event identically, so no
    absence authority is gained or lost by this ordering — only which
    sentence renders. Final order for the no-rows branch: source_failure
    (checked earlier, outside this block) -> no coverage_start (checked
    earlier) -> stale -> scoped/unscoped coverage exception ->
    upstream_degraded -> measured_no_event. Without this ordering, the
    commission's four-category distinguishability requirement (transport
    degraded / scoped unresolved / unscoped unresolved / clean measured
    absence) would collapse two of the four into one whenever a same-run
    upstream_degraded status AND an open exception coexist.
