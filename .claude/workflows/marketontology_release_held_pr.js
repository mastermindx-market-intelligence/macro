const takeoverPrompt = (n) => `ROUTE: build
MISSION: Take over held PR #${n} in ${REPO} for Meta-CEO ${CEO} under the Chairman override, and bring its branch onto fresh origin/${BASE}.
${BUDGET(18, '')}
${AUTH_BLOCK}
WHY: the PR was frozen by a Sol HOLD; Sol is relieved for this program (charter §0) and the Meta-CEO now owns it to merge + live proof.
SCOPE: fresh-read; takeover comment; rebase/merge-forward; push. No code changes beyond conflict resolution.
OUT OF SCOPE: reviewing the content (next stage); marking Ready; merging.
FROZEN SPEC: procedure below. OWNED FILES: only conflict resolutions. TESTS: run the test files touched by any conflict resolution.
PROCEDURE:
1. Work in a fresh sparse worktree of ${LOCAL}'s repo: cd "${LOCAL}" && git fetch origin ${BASE} && WT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.claude/worktrees/mo-release-${n}" && git worktree add --no-checkout "$WT" origin/${BASE} 2>/dev/null || true; if that path already exists reuse it (record its absolute path in evidence.branch or a note so the Fix stage does not have to re-derive it). In that worktree run: python3 scripts/worktree_sparse.py auto (thins to the sparse default), then git checkout -q origin/${BASE}; only if the PR touches site/templates run python3 scripts/worktree_sparse.py add site (add data too if the PR touches data/). Never hand-roll \`git sparse-checkout set\`. This path is under the session's own worktree roots so scripts/worktree_gc.py can see and reclaim it -- never $TMPDIR or /private/tmp.
2. Fresh-read the PR: gh pr view ${n} -R ${REPO} --json state,isDraft,title,body,headRefName,headRefOid,baseRefName,labels,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,reviewDecision,comments,files. Record the HOLD text (title/body/comments grep -i 'HOLD'), the last comment time/author, the files list. If state is MERGED or CLOSED: return COMPLETE with pr_state and do nothing else.
3. If a comment containing "Meta-CEO" and "taking PR #${n}" already exists on the PR, do NOT post another (record its URL); otherwise post ONE takeover comment: gh pr comment ${n} -R ${REPO} --body "Meta-CEO ${CEO} taking PR #${n} under the Chairman override of 2026-09-05 (charter research/MARKET_ONTOLOGY_META_CEO_CHARTER_2026_09_06.md). The recorded HOLD-FOR-SOL is released to Meta-CEO review: opus review -> fixes -> Ready -> merge-on-green -> merge -> live proof. Prior owner session may stop; do not push to this branch after this comment." Record the comment URL.
4. Bring the branch current: git fetch origin <headRefName> && git checkout -B <headRefName> origin/<headRefName> — if git refuses because that branch is already checked out in another worktree (a sibling/Codex session), do NOT touch that other tree: run 'git checkout --detach origin/<headRefName>' instead and push later with 'git push --force-with-lease origin HEAD:refs/heads/<headRefName>'; if worktree_sparse.py or git reports a stale index.lock / sparse-checkout.lock (0 bytes, no live process), delete that lock file and re-run once. Then git rebase origin/${BASE} (preferred). On conflicts: resolve minimally in favor of keeping BOTH main's landed fixes and the PR's intent (read both sides; never drop a main-side change), run the touched tests, continue. If the rebase is unsafe (>15 conflicted files or generated artifacts), abort the rebase and instead git merge origin/${BASE} with the same resolution rule. Push: git push --force-with-lease origin <headRefName> (rebase) or git push (merge). Record head_before/head_after/base_sha.
5. ${QUOTA}
NOT DONE UNLESS: the takeover comment exists, the branch head is a descendant of fresh origin/${BASE} (git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/${BASE} HEAD), the push succeeded, and every conflict resolution is listed.

const reviewPrompt = (n, t) => `ROUTE: review
MISSION: Adversarially review PR #${n} (${REPO}) at head ${t.head_after} for release under the Chairman override.
${BUDGET(22, 'Read the diff in at most 6 sed-range reads; prioritise the largest hunks and the tests.')}
${AUTH_BLOCK}
ARTIFACT TO ATTACK: gh pr diff ${n} -R ${REPO} (after git fetch origin ${BASE}; base sha ${t.base_sha}); the PR body's claims and evidence; tests; the HOLD text ("${(t.hold_text_found || '').slice(0, 300)}") — decide whether the hold's release condition is a genuine defect that must be fixed before merge or Sol-era ceremony that no longer binds.
REVIEW STANDARD: FRONT-END CLARITY LAW (Chairman, 2026-09-06; supersedes nothing in the design doctrine, sharpens it): every user-facing surface must be clear and user-friendly for a fintech SaaS customer — plain words, one-line stance per module (what it means and what to do, even if that is watch, do not chase), technicals and internal names demoted to hover/details, no machine text (no raw slugs, internal state names, untranslated stat names, timestamps without meaning), no walls of text, honest nulls in plain words ("Not available yet" + why), bilingual EN/ZH. Reviewers REJECT a surface a non-quant customer could not read in 10 seconds. (a UI PR that violates it gets FIX_REQUIRED with the exact strings to rewrite, not REJECT); correctness vs the PR's stated scope; no proprietary Market Ontology copying; lane do_not_redo from the lane's agentos handoff respected; nulls printed not hidden; no LLM-originated signals/scores; only the two nav families; for UI both theme treatments (dark/light) and EN/ZH present with evidence; tests exercise the change; no data/ or site/ truncation artifacts (a site/ or data/ file shrinking to a few KB in a sparse tree is a truncation, not an edit); no writes outside the PR's lane; annotations start the line; Supabase DDL only through reviewed migration files.
SCOPE: this PR only. Read-only: no edits, comments, labels, merges. Work from ${LOCAL} (git fetch is fine).
NOT DONE UNLESS: each blocker/major names file:line + the fix; PASS only with zero blockers and zero majors; the verdict states explicitly whether the HOLD condition is satisfied, obsolete, or still a blocker.
EVIDENCE REQUIRED: quoted hunks per finding.

MISSION: Repair PR #${n} (${REPO}, branch ${t.branch}) so the reviewer's blockers and majors are resolved.
${BUDGET(24, 'If the fixes cannot fit, commit + push what is done and list the rest in GAPS.')}
${AUTH_BLOCK}
WHY: Wave 0 releases held work only when it is actually correct; the Meta-CEO's review replaces Sol's hold.
SCOPE: the findings below. OUT OF SCOPE: scope creep; merging; changing unrelated files.
FROZEN SPEC: the PR's own stated scope; findings:
BLOCKERS:${(r.blockers || []).map(b => `\n- ${b}`).join('') || ' none'}
MAJORS:${(r.majors || []).map(b => `\n- ${b}`).join('') || ' none'}
OWNED FILES: the PR's files plus tests. TESTS: re-run touched tests + any checker a finding names (python -m pytest <files> -q; never the full suite in a sparse tree).
PROCEDURE: reuse the worktree at "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.claude/worktrees/mo-release-${n}" (git fetch origin ${t.branch} && git checkout -B ${t.branch} origin/${t.branch}); add site via python3 scripts/worktree_sparse.py add site if the PR touches site/templates; fix; test; commit with "Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>"; fresh-read gh pr view ${n} --json state,headRefOid before pushing; git push origin ${t.branch}. Append a "## Meta-CEO ${CEO} review fixes" section to the PR body (gh pr edit --body-file) listing each finding and its fix; never delete existing body text.
NOT DONE UNLESS: every blocker and major is fixed and pushed, or listed in GAPS with the reason.

const shipPrompt = (n, t) => `ROUTE: build
MISSION: Release PR #${n} (${REPO}, branch ${t.branch}) to MERGED and LIVE-VERIFIED and report on macro#6819.
${BUDGET(20, 'Checking checks is a bounded poll loop (see step 3), not a single long watch call.')}
${AUTH_BLOCK}
WHY: DONE is merged + live (fleet law); the Chairman wants built work live, not parked.
SCOPE: title/label/Ready edits, waiting, merging, live verification, the wave comment. OUT OF SCOPE: code changes (a genuinely red check on this head -> return BLOCKED with job name + log excerpt).
FROZEN SPEC: n/a. OWNED FILES: none. TESTS: none.
PROCEDURE:
1. Fresh-read: gh pr view ${n} -R ${REPO} --json state,isDraft,title,headRefOid,labels,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,statusCheckRollup. If already MERGED, skip to step 5.
2. Release the hold with the sweeper-proof helper (ONE call; it strips the title marker, rewrites every hold line in the body, posts the HOLD-RELEASED comment, marks Ready, swaps merge-blocked for merge-on-green, and re-verifies with scripts/merge_on_green.recorded_hold): H="${LOCAL}/.claude/worktrees/mo-release-${n}/.claude/workflows/release_hold_text.py"; [ -f "$H" ] || { git -C "${LOCAL}" fetch -q origin ${BASE}; (git -C "${LOCAL}" show origin/${BASE}:.claude/workflows/release_hold_text.py || (git -C "${LOCAL}" fetch -q origin claude/marketontology-meta-ceo-charter-20260906 && git -C "${LOCAL}" show origin/claude/marketontology-meta-ceo-charter-20260906:.claude/workflows/release_hold_text.py)) > "$TMPDIR/release_hold_text.py" && H="$TMPDIR/release_hold_text.py"; }; MO_REPO_ROOT="${LOCAL}" python3 "$H" ${n} --repo ${REPO} --ceo ${CEO}. Exit 0 with held_after=null is the only acceptable result; exit 2 means a hold is still recorded — read its JSON and return BLOCKED quoting held_after. Never delete prior body text by hand.
3. ${QUOTA} A Bash call is capped at 10 minutes, so a single foreground \`gh pr checks --watch\` will be killed before a 30-45 min macro ci.yml run concludes: do NOT use it. Poll in bounded rounds instead, each its own Bash call (sleep >=90s per quota law): \`for i in $(seq 1 3); do gh pr checks ${n} -R ${REPO} --json name,state,conclusion --jq '.[] | [.name,.state,.conclusion] | @tsv'; sleep 170; done\`. Repeat across multiple such calls until every check has CONCLUDED ("Workers Builds: macro" red is known-spurious and ignorable; a pending check is not a pass). If checks are still pending when this stage's budget wall is reached, return PARTIAL naming the armed merge-on-green sweeper as the eventual merge performer and live verification as still owed.
4. Fresh-read again (state, headRefOid, mergeStateStatus). If the sweeper already merged: record the sha. Else on concluded green (spurious Workers X excluded): gh pr merge ${n} -R ${REPO} --squash --delete-branch. On a merge conflict: return BLOCKED naming the paths. Never --admin past a real red; never close/reopen; never rename the branch.
5. Live verification (${REPO_KEY}): ${REPO_KEY === 'terminal'
    ? 'merge to master runs /opt/terminal/terminal-build.sh; poll https://app.mastermind-x.com every 120s up to 20 min (curl -sI, then curl -s a route the diff changed) until a marker from the diff is served; record status + marker.'
    : 'the VPS pulls main every 3 min; paired plain-copy assets are live after that. Template/engine changes need the shared render lane: gh run list -R mastermindx-market-intelligence/macro --workflow render.yml --branch main --limit 3 --json databaseId,status,conclusion,headSha,createdAt; watch the run whose head is at/after the merge sha with gh run watch <id> --interval 120 (never cancel/re-run); then curl -s the live page(s) the PR adds/changes and grep a marker from the diff; curl -sI for status. If the PR adds a page that must be reachable, curl the nav entry page and grep the link.'}
6. Post ONE comment on issue macro#6819: gh issue comment 6819 -R mastermindx-market-intelligence/macro --body "[Meta-CEO ${CEO}] Wave 0: PR #${n} merged as <sha>; live proof: <url> <status> <marker>; released under the Chairman override (charter research/MARKET_ONTOLOGY_META_CEO_CHARTER_2026_09_06.md)." Record its URL.
NOT DONE UNLESS: merged is true with the exact sha and live_verified is true with URL + status + marker (records-only PRs: say "no live surface" and set live_verified true with the merge readback as proof), and the #6819 comment exists.
