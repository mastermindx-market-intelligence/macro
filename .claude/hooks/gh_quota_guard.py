"""PreToolUse guard: keep one session from eating the shared GitHub REST quota.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-07-26, twice in one day, two different sessions).
`gh` authenticates as ONE account token, so REST's 5,000/hr `core` pool is a
single bucket shared by every parallel Claude session, the babysitter lane, and
the hooks themselves. Burning it does not slow one session down, it 403s all of
them for up to an hour.

The sharpest bite is self-inflicted: `.claude/hooks/ship_loop_guard.py` spends up
to four REST calls per Stop evaluation and FAILS CLOSED on rate limiting. So
polling hard to watch CI blocks the very Stop the watching was meant to reach.

A memory note (`ci-poll-quota-and-false-settle`) already described all of this,
and a session walked into it an hour after another session wrote it down. Notes
do not bind; a hook does. This denies only the three shapes that provably burned
the pool, and fails OPEN on everything else — a guard that bricks the harness is
worse than a missed warning.

  1. `gh run watch` at its DEFAULT 3-second interval. Ten minutes of that is
     ~200 polls, each fetching the run AND its jobs (this repo runs ~130 checks
     per PR). Three such windows exhausted 5,000 calls. Allowed with an explicit
     `--interval`/-i of >= 60.
  2. A `gh` call in a poll loop sleeping under 90s. Two watchers on one endpoint
     at 45s took 4,488 -> 0 in under an hour.
  3. `--paginate` against check-runs/jobs. ~130 checks is several pages per poll,
     and one page already answers "is it still running".
  4. Re-dispatching a main PROOF workflow (ci.yml / fences.yml /
     integration-baseline.yml) while one is already in flight on main
     (2026-08-09). This one is not about request count, it is about the same
     reflex: a pinned session re-firing the documented recovery lever. Until
     that day every main dispatch of ci.yml landed in `ci-refs/heads/main` with
     a flat `cancel-in-progress: true`, so the second dispatch did not queue —
     it KILLED the first. Measured: run 31309720615 was cancelled 44 minutes in
     by dispatch 31311537537, itself cancelled 4 minutes later by 31311693575,
     while 12 merge-blocked + 56 cap-deferred pull requests waited on a proof
     that could therefore never conclude. The workflows are fixed (the flag is
     event-conditional as of the same day), so a race is now merely wasteful
     rather than destructive — but the reflex is what opened the wound, and a
     run already holding a runner is the fastest proof available. Allowed when
     the in-flight run is an orphan (queued > 40 min), and fail-OPEN on any
     probe error: this guard is anti-waste, and a fail-closed deny would wedge
     the very recovery lever it protects.
  6. CANCELLING A PRODUCTION LANE (2026-08-12). Not a quota shape at all — the
     same reflex, one step further. A live fleet session force-cancelled the US
     nightly's recovery dispatches six times (receipt: POST
     /actions/runs/31583415065/force-cancel); stacked on the #5362 workflow-size
     strand the night before, Prophet US served Aug-10 picks for two full
     sessions and the operator found it by looking at the site. A cancel is
     invisible to every staleness instrument we own, because a killed bake and a
     bake that never fired leave the same trace: nothing. CLAUDE.md already
     forbade this in prose ("never cancel or manually re-run an in-progress
     render, engine-render or daily merely to unblock this session"); prose did
     not bind. Denies a cancel aimed at a data-advancing or publishing lane and
     fails OPEN when the run cannot be resolved — an operator can still kill a
     genuinely wedged run, that is just no longer something a session does on
     its own initiative.

  7. RE-READING THE SAME CI STATUS FASTER THAN IT CAN CHANGE (2026-08-27, the
     SECOND time an operator has had to say it). Not a loop and not a hot
     `--interval`, so shapes 1-2 never saw it: a session answers each Stop-hook
     block with one more single `gh pr checks <n>`. Measured that day: ~25
     consecutive Stop cycles, each one poll, while 12 ci-packs ran — and the
     session already had a background watcher armed at 150s that was reporting
     every transition for free. The operator: "how come u check it so often...
     literally u can just check every 5 mins or something, not every 20
     seconds". A ci.yml run here takes 30-45 minutes, so a read 20 seconds after
     the last one cannot return a different answer; it is pure shared-pool spend
     plus a full context re-read every turn.
     The mechanism that defeats prose here is worth naming, because it is not
     laziness: the Stop hook fires on EVERY turn and escalates to "If the same
     genuine blocker persists after another attempt, finish with SHIP LOOP
     BLOCKED", which reads as a demand to demonstrate a fresh attempt. It is
     not - a blocked Stop is satisfied by a one-line hold note. A memory note
     (`never-poll-ci-with-short-cycle-checks`) said all of this after the first
     operator order on 2026-08-24 and did not bind, which is the same reason
     shapes 1 and 6 exist as code.
     This one is ADVICE, not a decision: it attaches `additionalContext` to a
     REPEAT of the same status shape inside POLL_COOLDOWN_S and always allows.
     A deny would contradict this file's own standing rule, pinned by
     `test_ci_observation_is_never_denied_for_owning_an_open_pull_request` — the
     guard governs HOW a session watches, never WHETHER, and no state outside
     the command line makes reading your own PR illegal. A cooldown IS such
     state. If advice proves as unbinding as prose was, escalating shape 7 to a
     deny is a RULING for the operator, not a refactor.
     The first read of any shape is silent, a different run/PR is a different
     shape, writes are never polls, and the window self-clears.

A session owns its pull request through to the merge, so it WILL be watching CI.
Shapes 1-4 and 7 govern HOW that watching happens, never WHETHER it may: one
slow watcher per endpoint (`--interval 60` or higher), preflight
`gh api rate_limit`, and an empty or 403 response read as "unknown" rather than
as settled. This guard never denies a `gh` call merely because a pull request is
open or armed.
