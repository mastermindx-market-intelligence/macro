"""WorktreeCreate hook — mint session worktrees off fresh origin/main, sparse.

CONTRACT (set by the harness, preserved byte-for-byte from the zsh prototype
this replaces): stdin carries a JSON object with `name` (the requested worktree
name) and `cwd` (a path inside the repo the session was launched from); STDOUT
must carry the created worktree path and NOTHING else; progress goes to stderr;
exit 0 = created.

WHAT IT DOES
------------
1. `git fetch --prune origin main`, so every session starts on fresh origin/main
   (house law: branch off fresh origin/main, never a squash-merged branch).
2. `git worktree add --no-checkout -b worktree-<name>`.
3. Applies the sparse profile from `config/sparse_worktree.json` — every tracked
   top-level directory EXCEPT the heavy generated ones (`data/`, `site/`,
   `mockups/`, `verify_shots/`).
4. `git read-tree -mu HEAD` to populate exactly the selected paths (a
   `--no-checkout` worktree starts with an empty index).

A name of the form `pr-<N>` bases the worktree on that pull request's head
instead of origin/main.

WHY (research/WORKTREE_GC_POLICY.md §0 R8)
------------------------------------------
A full checkout is ~3.8 GiB and 87 % of that is generated artifacts. At ~40
session worktrees/day the 0-3 d active window is a ~330 GiB standing working set
the GC sweeper cannot touch — it only reclaims FINISHED trees. On 2026-08-13 the
Studio sat at 1.7 Ti / 1.8 Ti (~100 GiB free) after two receipted runner ENOSPC
crashes. Arming the GC (#5502) drains the finished pool; this hook shrinks the
active one. Measured: ~0.35-0.57 GiB per tree instead of 3.8 GiB.

Nothing is hidden by this: the omitted paths stay tracked, `git status` stays
clean (skip-worktree), and a session that needs them runs
`python3 scripts/worktree_sparse.py full`. Guards and tests that REQUIRE a heavy
tree detect the omission and refuse or skip with that command in the message —
see scripts/worktree_sparse.py, which is the single detector they all share.

WHERE IT PLANTS (2026-08-20)
----------------------------
Under the checkout the SESSION was launched in, not under the main working tree.
The hook used to derive its destination from ``--git-common-dir``, whose answer
is identical from every checkout of a clone — so every Claude worktree landed in
``Macro Dashboard/.claude/worktrees/`` no matter which folder the operator
opened, including the operator-designated local root the workspace law points
every session at. Placement now follows ``--show-toplevel``, climbed out of any
session-worktree root so spawns never nest, with ``MACRO_LOCAL_ROOT`` as the
explicit override. Only the BYTES move: the clone is one clone, so every
worktree stays registered in ``Macro Dashboard/.git/worktrees/`` and that folder
remains undeletable (see CLAUDE.md § Shared workspace).

``scripts/worktree_gc.py`` expands its repo-relative roots under every host
checkout for the same reason — a tree the sweeper cannot see is a tree it can
never reclaim.

IDEMPOTENT ON PURPOSE
---------------------
The zsh prototype was wired through `.claude/settings.local.json`, which is
globally gitignored — so the behaviour worked but was neither versioned,
reviewable, nor shipped to any other clone. While both wirings may coexist on a
host mid-migration, whichever hook runs second must not fail the spawn: an
existing destination that is already a registered worktree of this repo is
reported as success.

# ── where the new worktree is PLANTED ────────────────────────────────────────
# The bytes of a session worktree and the git metadata registering it live in
# different places, and conflating the two is what planted every Claude worktree
# in the forbidden directory. `--git-common-dir` answers with the MAIN working
# tree's `.git` from EVERY checkout of a clone, so `common.parent` is a constant:
# on this host it can only ever name `Macro Dashboard`, no matter which folder
# the operator opened. That is the right answer to "which git do I talk to" and
# the wrong answer to "where do the files go" — and because it is a constant, no
# session could ever escape it by launching somewhere else.
#
# Placement instead follows the checkout the SESSION was launched in, climbed out
# of any session-worktree root so a spawn plants a sibling rather than nesting.

# `config/worktree_gc.json` roots and `.gitignore` —
