"""Enforce Macro Dashboard's commit -> PR -> merge -> live completion contract.

SessionStart records a baseline so a shared checkout's pre-existing dirt is never
mistaken for work from this session. Stop blocks when session-created changes are
uncommitted, unpushed, unmerged, awaiting a render that has not started or that
concluded failed, or not yet present on production.

An IN-FLIGHT covering render no longer blocks: the VPS pulls main every 3 minutes
independent of Actions, so a merged commit is live in minutes regardless, the lane
only re-bakes ``.j2`` pages and the ``?v=`` stamp, house law forbids a waiting
session from cancelling or re-running it, and the nightly ``scope=all`` re-render
self-heals a failed lane within a day — so ``_stop`` defers to the shared
coalescing lane rather than holding a session the lane's ~67+ minutes (observed
sessions sat 3h46m-4h02m for a lane they may not touch).

Rendering is TWO lanes, and the gate asks whichever one owns the merge. #3834 split
the data-free public surfaces out of the heavy self-hosted ``render.yml`` into the
GitHub-hosted ``public-render.yml``, so for a public-only change a push-triggered
``render.yml`` run cannot exist and demanding one blocked forever (#3897, live and
green on the other lane). Ownership is parsed from both workflows at Stop time — see
``_render_lane_filters`` — never transcribed here, so the guard cannot drift from
the split.

ARMING ``merge-on-green`` IS NOT AN EXIT (operator ruling 2026-08-12). The label
still works and the sweeper may still perform the merge — that is a convenience,
not a transfer of ownership. A session owns its work through
commit -> push -> PR -> CI -> squash-merge -> live verification, so ``unmerged``
is satisfied by an actually-merged pull request and by nothing else. The earlier
rule released a session the moment its pull request carried the label with no
concluded red; in the field that turned an unfinished job into a reported-complete
one — a session stopped on a label while its pull request sat ``merge-blocked`` on
a red check, and the work had to be reopened by hand. What the armed pull request
still buys is a better BLOCK: ``_armed_pull_status`` names the reds the sweeper
will refuse, so the session is told what to fix instead of merely that it may not
leave. The merge-on-CONCLUDED-checks law is unchanged — a pending check is not a
pass, and an ``--admin`` merge mid-flight destroyed the pull request's own proof
run (#3867).

THE GUARD MAY NOT WEDGE THE TREE IT IS JUDGING. Its own ``git status`` used to be
run under a plain ``subprocess`` timeout, whose expiry is a SIGKILL git cannot
catch; on 2026-08-19 that left a stale ``index.lock`` in a full worktree's gitdir
and turned a slow read into a broken checkout. Timed-out git is now asked to leave
with SIGTERM before it is killed, a timed-out status is retried once on the warm
index the first pass paid for, and a lock this guard itself orphaned is swept —
but only when zero-byte, unheld, and newer than this process. See
``GIT_TERM_GRACE_SECONDS``, ``_status_output``, and ``_sweep_stale_index_lock``;
none of them relaxes the gate, and a status that cannot answer twice still blocks.

Every blocker also carries an escape ladder, because the field kept producing
UNSATISFIABLE gates: one session refused Stop 258 consecutive times on ``unmerged``
and another 245 times on ``render_failed``, and the guard took 13 patches in 17
days for such classes. See ``_block`` for the two ladders (external: 2 consecutive
or 3 cumulative; any code: 10 consecutive or 15 total; always requiring an explicit
``SHIP LOOP BLOCKED:`` evidence report). Repository rules remain the source of
truth; this hook makes them executable.

The ladders themselves were unreachable until 2026-08-04, so the brick they exist
to prevent happened to them: the release condition demanded a payload flag the
harness clears on any turn it did not itself start. Session 787452b5 filed a
correct ``SHIP LOOP BLOCKED:`` report on ``live_stale`` with both external arms
armed and was refused, because a background ``<task-notification>`` had started
that turn and reset ``stop_hook_active`` to False. Re-entrancy now also counts as
proven when this guard's own persisted ledger shows a prior block, and the report
itself is recovered from ``transcript_path`` when ``last_assistant_message`` — an
UNDOCUMENTED payload field — is absent. Both changes make the report DETECTABLE;
neither makes it optional, and no counter moved.

# `subprocess.run(timeout=...)` shoots a straggler with SIGKILL, which git cannot
# catch — so the `index.lock` git's own lockfile machinery would have unlinked on

# declines to write the refreshed index), which is what makes this quiet: what
# fails is every git that WRITES the index — `add`, `commit`, `checkout`, `stash`
# — i.e. exactly the session's next move. That is the #5907 class, a guard
# timeout corrupting the checkout it was only reading, observed live 2026-08-19:
# on a FULL worktree (~5,800 files, 3 GiB of `data/`) under fleet I/O load one
# `git status` took 161s wall at 10% CPU, the 90s budget expired, the SIGKILLed
# git left a zero-byte `index.lock` in the worktree gitdir, and the guard filed
# `guard_error` against a tree it had just wedged itself. Asking before shooting
# is the fix: git installs a SIGTERM handler for exactly this case.
#
# `scripts/worktree_sparse.py` fought the same hazard from the other end (#5907,
# a killed `sparse-checkout add` leaving a truncated file plus a stale lock) and
# landed on the same ladder; this is deliberately its `TERM_GRACE_S`, same value
# and same reasoning — generous for a cleanup handler that measures well under a
# second, bounded enough that a process ignoring SIGTERM dies promptly.
GIT_TERM_GRACE_SECONDS = 10
# Two status budgets, because the first `git status` on a cold full checkout PAYS
# FOR the second: the same tree that needed 161s cold answered in 13s once its
# index and page cache were warm. One budget cannot express that — it would have
# to be the cold number, and the cold number does not fit the wall below.
#
# The wall is `.claude/settings.json`, where Stop gives this hook 540s
# (SessionStart, 30s), and the HARNESS enforces it. Budgets larger than that wall
# can never conclude: the hook is cancelled mid-flight and the Stop evaluation
# silently does not happen at all, which is a fail-OPEN — strictly worse than the
# block it was trying to file. So the numbers below are chosen so that the WHOLE
# pathological path fits, sweeps, the untracked-cache heal, and grace periods
# included, not just the two status attempts: 100 + 10 grace, + a first sweep
# (5 + 10 grace to resolve the gitdir, 5 for lsof), + 260 + 10 grace, + a second
# sweep (5 for lsof; the gitdir is cached by then), + the heal (5 + 10 to read the
# config, 20 + 10 to test the filesystem, 5 + 10 to write it) = 465. That path ends
# in a raise and a `guard_error` emit, which is all it needs after.
#
# 465 is NOT the whole story and the residual is deliberate, not slack. The costlier
# shape is the one that SUCCEEDS: a retry that answers just under its budget reaches
# ~449s (110 + 20 + 259 + the 60s heal) and then still owes the entire rest of
# `_stop` — the PR lookup, CI attribution (up to ~16 REST calls when there is a red
# to attribute), render coverage, live verification. Those are what the remaining
# ~90s is for. Sizing the wall to 465 would leave that path ~15s and cancel the hook
# mid-evaluation on exactly the trees this change is meant to serve. The same
# reasoning covers the bounded probes in `main()` ahead of `_fingerprint`
# (`_repo_root`'s `rev-parse` at the default 45s leash, run twice on the delegating
# path): sub-second in health, and not silently assumed to be free.
#
# The 2026-08-21 rebalance (60/70 of a 180s wall -> 100/150 of a 300s wall) fixed a
# tree the old split could not answer at all. The retry's whole premise is that the
# first pass leaves a warmed index for the second — but that only holds if the first
# pass is allowed to FINISH. A sparse, blobless worktree on a slow (iCloud-backed)
# volume measured a ~78s cold `status` against a ~3s warm one: at a 60s first budget
# the cold pass was SIGKILLed at ~77% done, warmed nothing, and the 70s retry then
# paid full cold cost and died too — filing `guard_error` on a tree that answers in
# 3s once warm. BOTH attempts sat under the cold cost, so the pair could never
# succeed no matter how often it ran. The first budget must therefore clear a
# realistic cold walk on its own (100 > 78), while the retry stays the longer of the
# two for the genuinely pathological tree the original incident recorded (161s cold
# / 13s warm): that one still misses the first pass and lands on the warm retry,
# exactly as designed. Raising the wall is the cost of covering both shapes; a Stop
# that takes 5 minutes on the pathological path still beats one that is killed
# mid-evaluation, because a killed Stop hook fails OPEN.
#
# The SECOND rebalance (150 -> 260, 2026-08-21) is the same arithmetic failing at a
# larger scale, and it is why `_enable_untracked_cache` exists. Worktree
# `celh-cycle-autopsy-c5adcc` of the 250-worktree `Macro Dashboard` clone measured a
# **333s** cold `status` (75,427 index entries, `core.untrackedCache` unset) against
# a 1s warm one — the incident hit the then-current 60s first budget, which bought
# ~18% of that walk before the SIGKILL, so the retry started essentially cold too
# and blew its own — `guard_error` on a tree that was clean, committed and pushed.
# A retry only 50% longer than the first attempt cannot absorb a cold walk several
# times either budget: the retry has to clear what the warm-up pass did NOT reach.
# 260 is sized on the assumption that warming is roughly linear in elapsed time —
# 100s of a 333s walk leaves ~233s, so 260 carries ~11% margin. That model is an
# ESTIMATE, not a measurement, and it is exactly why the heal below matters more
# than this number: if the walk is worse than linear the retry still dies, and a
# budget alone would leave the tree in the same loop it is in today.
#
# The budget is the fallback; the heal is the fix. `_enable_untracked_cache` turns
# that walk into a sub-second one — measured on the same clone with it enabled:
# 75,551 index entries, `UNTR` present in the index, `status` in 0.63s. Scope,
# stated precisely because the loose version of this claim is wrong: the CONFIG is
# clone-shared, so every worktree becomes ELIGIBLE at once, but the cache itself is
# an index extension and each worktree has its OWN index — so each still pays a
# single cold walk that must COMPLETE before it is cheap. This heals the clone; it
# does not retroactively heal 250 checkouts.
# `tests/test_ship_loop_guard.py` pins that arithmetic against the settings file so
# the two cannot drift apart unnoticed.

    a SIGTERMed or SIGKILLed git leaves it there. Left alone that directory turns

    on a tree that is otherwise clean, so the guard would file a false `uncommitted`

    This is the actual repair for the 2026-08-21 incident; the retry budget is only
    the fallback that lets THIS invocation still answer. A `status
    --untracked-files=all` on a cold cache re-walks every directory in the worktree,
    which on the affected clone cost 333s; the untracked cache makes git reuse the
    previous walk per directory, keyed on the directory's mtime, and the same clone
    then answered in 0.63s. Enabling it converts a tree that cannot be read into one
    that is read for free, permanently and for every worktree of the clone — a
    linked worktree's unscoped `git config` write lands in the clone's SHARED
    config, which is the right scope precisely because the next session gets a
    healed tree without ever paying this path. That holds even though this clone
    runs `extensions.worktreeConfig=true`: only an explicit `--worktree` writes the
    per-worktree file, while `--get` still reads it, so a worktree-scoped value
    would be seen and respected by the refusal below rather than silently reset.

    The cache itself lives in each worktree's own index (the `UNTR` extension) and
    is written by the first walk that COMPLETES there, so the config write is the
    durable half and each worktree populates its own on first success.

    Racing sessions are safe: `git config` takes `config.lock` and the losers exit
    non-zero with `could not lock config file` (measured, 20 concurrent writers —
    one winner, valid config, no duplicate keys), which this reads as "not ours to
    claim" and drops. `--test-untracked-cache` never touches the index (measured:
    identical index hash across it), so it cannot collide with a sibling's git.

    Three refusals, all fail-SAFE, because a wrong "yes" here is the only way this
    function could weaken the gate:

    * An already-configured value is never overwritten, in either direction. An
      operator (or a previous heal) who set `false` decided that deliberately, and
      an unreadable/odd exit status is not evidence of anything — only a clean rc 1,
      git's specific "this key is unset", is taken as permission to write.
    * `--test-untracked-cache` must pass FIRST. The cache trusts directory mtimes,
      so on a filesystem that does not update them reliably git would report a
      directory as unchanged and MISS untracked files in it. That is a fail-OPEN in
      the dirty check this whole hook exists to make — a session's new files would
      simply not appear. Skipping the test to save its ~6s would trade a slow honest
      answer for a fast dishonest one, so it is never skipped.
    * Any exception at all leaves the cache alone. The heal is an optimisation on
      the way to a retry that has its own budget; it must never become the reason
      the retry does not happen.

    Attempted at most once per process: a filesystem that fails the test would
    otherwise re-pay those ~6s on every call, and the result cannot change mid-run.

    invocation in 13s, because the first pass had already paid the cold-cache
    cost for the second. Failing on the first timeout threw that warm-up away and
    reported `guard_error` on a tree that was one cheap re-run from answering.

    Both timeout paths sweep, because a lock this guard orphaned outlives the
    process that made it: once before the retry, so the retry does not trip over
    our own wreckage, and once more before giving up, so the NEXT invocation
    starts from a tree this one did not wedge.

    A first attempt that timed out also triggers `_enable_untracked_cache`, which
    is the difference between a tree that keeps timing out and one that stops: a
    blown first budget is the only evidence this hook ever gets that a checkout is
    too slow to read, and it is a good one — a healthy tree never reaches that
    line, and so never pays the heal's ~6s filesystem test.

    The heal runs AFTER the status has been read, never between the two attempts,
    and that ordering is load-bearing rather than cosmetic. Its `--test-untracked-
    cache` writes a scratch directory into the worktree root; a killed one leaves it
    there (measured), and a `status` run afterwards would report it as untracked —
    letting the guard file a false `uncommitted` block naming a file the guard
    itself created. `_remove_mtime_test_scratch` is the direct repair for that, and
    reading status first means even a cleanup that fails cannot contaminate THIS
    invocation's answer. Nothing is lost by waiting: the cache is populated by the
    first walk that COMPLETES, so it could never have rescued a retry that follows a
    killed attempt anyway — the retry's own budget has to be able to finish the walk
    alone, and the heal is for every invocation after this one.

    Fail-closed is unchanged. A status that times out twice re-raises, `main`
    files `guard_error`, and Stop blocks — the retry buys a second chance to
    ANSWER, never permission to skip the question, and the heal changes only how
    long the answer takes, never whether one is required.

    while the nightly and wire lanes push ~24 `[skip ci]` commits per 2 hours, so a
    commit-window heuristic ages out in ~100 minutes and returns zero `ci-pack-*`
    names no matter how healthy main is (#5037, 2026-08-08).

    Job names are compared to CHECK names directly. That identity is the sweeper's
    own assumption in `_run_clean_jobs`, and the two must not drift apart.

    STALENESS IS FAIL-CLOSED. A proof run that started more than `BASE_SIDE_WINDOW`
    from ``reference`` describes a different base vintage and is discarded, so a
    three-day-old red main can never excuse today's genuine regression. An
    unreadable run, an undated one, or an empty listing likewise contributes
    nothing — and contributing nothing keeps the red on this session.

    WHY THIS EXISTS ON THE PRE-MERGE PATH AT ALL. `_check_ci` has carried
    base-side awareness since 2026-07-26, but it only ever judged a MERGED pull
    request, and under the retired release rule the pre-merge red path was reached
    rarely. It is now reached on EVERY Stop of EVERY armed session — which is
    precisely the population that inherits a red main. Without this, a routine
    fleet-wide pack red tells every session in the fleet "Fix the cause and re-run
    the failed job" about a defect none of them wrote, and several independently
    start healing a pack they did not break: the partial-heal deadlock CLAUDE.md
    §"Healing a red pack" exists to prevent. The measured shape of that day is on
    record — 61 pull requests armed, 60 red on `ci-pack-2`/`ci-pack-3` that main's
    own last run had proven green (#5037).

    Two sources, cheapest and most decisive first:

      B1, main is CURRENTLY red on the same NAME. Main's newest concluded proof run
        failing the same job is the strongest possible statement that the red is
        not ours: we are not on main.
      B2, sibling confirmation — the same name red on at least TWO INDEPENDENT
        concurrent pull-request heads. Identical machinery, bar, and rationale as
        `_check_ci`'s E2 (two distinct BRANCHES, because a pack name fronts many
        jobs and one sibling sharing it is a coincidence), differing only in the
        window: an unmerged head's content is on no shared base, so siblings on
        either side of our red are equally probative.

    FAIL-CLOSED THROUGHOUT, and the direction matters. An exception, an unreadable
    proof, a stale one, or a lone sibling yields NO exclusion, and the red stays
    this session's — a guard that guessed the other way would hand every genuine
    regression a base-side excuse. Both sources degrade independently and every
    failure is NAMED in the returned notes rather than swallowed.

    Nothing here releases anyone. Both outcomes still block: the exclusion only
    decides whether the session is told to fix its own defect or told that main is
    the cause and given main's lever.

    Returns name -> {sibling head_branch: sibling head_sha}. Independence is
    structural: a distinct head_branch that is not ours, on a sha that is not ours.
    Candidate runs must be `failure` runs created inside the half-open
    ``[floor, ceiling)`` the caller supplies.

    THE CEILING IS THE CALLER'S because the two callers are asking about different
    risks. `_check_ci` judges a MERGED pull request and passes
    ``(merged_at - 24h, merged_at)``: our content is on main from `merged_at`
    onward, so a sibling red after it can have OUR merge as its cause and is not
    evidence of anything. `_armed_pull_status` judges an UNMERGED head, whose
    content is on no shared base at all, so a sibling red on either side of our own
    red is equally probative and the window is centred on it. Passing the merged
    ceiling there would have discarded exactly the siblings that matter — under a
    fleet-wide red the other sessions' packs run continuously, and half of them run
    after ours.

    Candidates are keyed BY HEAD SHA, never per branch. A branch whose newer head
    dodged the defect does not retract the red its older head recorded: on the
    2026-07-26 live replay w2-support-page's 13:22 head had `ci-pack-1` green, and
    per-branch keep-newest silently discarded that branch's valid 12:51 red.

    Probe order is PROXIMITY to ``reference`` — the moment our own red started —
    not newest-first. This class of base-side defect is a temporal STRIPE (the
    chronicle red depends on the base vintage the merge ref happened to catch), so
    the siblings that ran nearest our failing check are the most probative, and
    proximity is immune to a burst of newer candidates crowding the listing.
    Newest-first UNDER-CONFIRMED a true base-side red in the field: with merged_at
    13:24:17Z and our `ci-pack-1` red started 12:06:25Z, a 13:14–13:22Z burst of
    other sessions' pushes filled the top five candidate slots and every one had
    `ci-pack-1` GREEN (their runs failed on other checks), while the 11:59–12:17Z
    band around our own red held `ci-pack-1` completed+failure on SIX of seven
    distinct branches (outbox 12:07:08, cool-allen 12:04:51, w1-china 12:09:53,
    zealous 12:10:30, inline-shim 11:59:41, pss-f2 12:17:30; only jolly 12:00:48
    was green). An undated candidate cannot be ranked and sorts last.

    A confirmation is matched by CHECK SUITE, never by the check run's own clock.
    `github.sha` is frozen at event time, so `started_at` on a check run measures
    queue latency, not tree vintage: under runner contention (load ~44) a run
    created 13:22:00 had its `ci-pack-1` job start at 13:25:04 — after the merge —
    while still testing the pre-merge tree. The suite id is the precise linkage
    (workflow runs carry `check_suite_id`, check runs carry `check_suite.id`): a
    rerun replaces check runs within the SAME suite and replays the frozen tree, so
    it stays valid evidence, whereas a fresh post-merge pull_request event mints a
    NEW suite and is not. A missing suite id on either side is not a confirmation.

    Costs one listing call plus one probe per candidate head (at most 8). The probe
    is UNFILTERED so a single call answers every candidate name; truncation there
    can only UNDER-confirm, which keeps the red.

    """Judge the merged pull request's OWN head commit, then ask whose red it is.

    Head-only scoring stays deliberate: main's combined status is the product of
    every concurrent session's merges, so scoring against it would let an
    unrelated green main mask this pull request's red check (and an unrelated red
    one block a clean ship). The head commit is the only sha that answers "did
    THIS work pass".

    What a head sha cannot answer is WHOSE red it is. A defect already on main at
    pull time lands on the pull request's merge ref, and there it is PERMANENT:
    `gh run rerun` replays the frozen `refs/pull/N/merge` tree — a merged pull
    request's merge ref never recomputes against a healed base — and a follow-up
    pull request is impossible when the fix is already on main. Observed
    2026-07-26: the chronicle gate-1 staleness window (heal owned by PR #3634,
    still open) pinned merged PR #3629's `ci-pack-1` red forever; earlier #3503
    inherited a `tier-gate` red from #3488 the same way. Both sessions shipped
    green work and were forced into the `SHIP LOOP BLOCKED:` escape.

    The obvious comparisons are structurally unavailable in THIS repo (verified
    2026-07-26). ci.yml triggers on `pull_request` + `workflow_dispatch` ONLY, so
    main commits carry ZERO ci.yml check runs — merge base 8773e511b79 held only
    third-party "Workers Builds"/"Supabase Preview" app runs — which kills
    "compare the same check on the merge-base sha". ci-main-heartbeat.yml is
    schedule-only and mirrors a curated subset of individual pure-guard job names
    (nav-gap, tier-gate, …); it never runs `ci-pack-N`, which is exactly where
    suite failures like the chronicle pair surface, so name-matching against
    heartbeat conclusions cannot reach a pack. And a pack's legacy member names
    exist only as `if: false` definitions that publish `skipped` check runs —
    member granularity is not available at all.

    So the evidence model uses the two sources that DO exist.

    E1, merged-content-green (strongest; clears EVERY bad conclusion): a
    completed+success ci.yml run on branch=main whose head_sha is a main
    descendant of merge_sha. A descendant's tree contains the merge, so one full
    green run there proves the merged content passes and no per-name argument is
    needed. No ci.yml run on main has ever existed (total_count=0 today), which is
    the point: E1 is the OPERATOR'S DELIBERATE UNBLOCK LEVER — dispatch ci.yml on
    main once the base-side cause is healed and every pinned session clears at
    once. This mirrors `_render_status` accepting a dispatched render on a
    descendant. Since 2026-08-19, E1 is also the ONE clearing path for a frozen
    semantic `authority_changed=true` head whose only nonunit blocker is the
    authority freeze itself: the descendant run executes ON the merged authority,
    so it is proof of main under the new gate rather than the candidate-era
    evidence the fence forbids. Infrastructure ambiguity stays outside it.

    E2, base-side-red confirmation (per check name, `failure` conclusions only):
    the SAME name concluded `failure` on at least TWO INDEPENDENT concurrent
    sibling pull-request heads — distinct head_branch values, neither ours, on
    shas that are not ours — in runs created before this merge and no more than 24h
    before it. Run-level conclusions are NEVER evidence: in the 2026-07-26
    12:50–13:03Z window three sibling ci.yml runs (gracious-moser, brain-symmetric,
    brain-consistency) concluded failure with `ci-pack-1` GREEN — their own bugs —
    so nothing short of a per-head probe of the same NAME counts. The candidate run
    must PREDATE merged_at: an open pull request's merge ref recomputes against the
    moving base, so a post-merge sibling red can have OUR merged content as its
    cause. Inside that window, heads are probed in order of PROXIMITY to the moment
    our own red started (this defect class is a temporal stripe in the base
    vintage), and the second hop matches on CHECK SUITE rather than on the check
    run's clock (a job queued late under contention still tests the event-frozen
    tree). Both rules replaced weaker ones that under-confirmed a genuine base-side
    red on the live replay; `_base_side_confirmations` carries the dated evidence.
    The bar is two distinct BRANCHES — several heads of one branch count once —
    because pack-level names are the coarsest granularity available (see above):
    `ci-pack-1` fronts many jobs, so one sibling sharing the name is a real
    coincidence rather than a shared cause. Evidence is contemporaneous by
    construction (one listing page is roughly the last few hours on this repo),
    which matches when the guard actually evaluates: right after the merge.

    Fail-closed throughout. A lone sibling confirmation keeps the red. An absent
    merged_at, head_branch, or merge_sha skips the gate that depends on it rather
    than assuming it, and a missing check-suite id on either side of a probe is not
    a confirmation. The two gates degrade independently — either one's failure
    means "that gate found no exclusions" and is named in the reason, never a
    reclassified or swallowed verdict. Conclusions other than `failure`
    (cancelled, timed_out) are not E2-excludable, because rerunning the frozen
    tree genuinely can green those, while E1 clears them wholesale by proving the
    content. Pending checks keep the "CI still running" verdict even when every
    bad check is excluded. And the head listing is paginated for the same
    fail-closed reason: PR #3629's head carries 101 check runs, so the old single
    `per_page=100` call could hide a red past the first page.

    render.yml's push filter USED to be a bare `templates/**`, and its builder
    rule used to admit every top-level `scripts/build_*.py`, so those paths all
    demanded a render from the heavy self-hosted lane. Three things have since
    made that read wrong, and each one produced its own unsatisfiable gate.

    First, the lane only produces two things: re-baked `.j2` pages and the `?v=`
    content-hash re-stamp. A paired PLAIN-COPY asset — a non-.j2 file under
    templates/ that also ships as `site/<name>` — is neither. Its site/ copy is
    committed straight to main, and the VPS `macro-update` cron pulls main every
    3 minutes, so those bytes are live within minutes whether render ever runs or
    not.

    Demanding a render for them was a real, recurring false gate. Observed
    2026-07-26 on PR #3671 (templates/mm_brain.js + site/mm_brain.js, no .j2):
    merged 14:30Z, VPS served the new bytes by 14:33Z, byte-verified at three
    successive box HEADs — and the guard still refused Stop with `render_pending`
    for 40+ minutes, while 28 of the last 30 render.yml runs concluded
    `cancelled` and none concluded `success` (a repo-wide treadmill jam from a
    concurrent merge spree, unrelated to the PR). House law forbids cancelling
    or re-running a shared in-flight render to unblock a session, so the only
    exit was the `SHIP LOOP BLOCKED:` escape — which reads as a failed ship when
    the deploy had in fact succeeded. `go-live-deploy-mechanics` has recorded
    this as "a real false gate" since #3464/#3486.

    KNOWN AND ACCEPTED LIMIT: the exemption gives up the `?v=` re-stamp for the
    assets that carry one. The Caddyfile pins `?v=`-carrying requests to
    `max-age=31536000, immutable` for an enumerated list (theme.js, live.js,
    theme.css, product-nav-icons.css, onboard.*, landing.css, account.js,
    nav_market.js, supabase.js, data_base.js, chat*.css, assets/{css,landing}/*),
    so for THOSE a warm-cache visitor keeps the old body until a render re-hashes
    the pages that reference them (`asset-stamp-frozen-not-stable`). Assets off
    that list — mm_brain.js among them, which is why #3671 was fully live — fall
    back to `max-age=300, must-revalidate` and go live on the next revalidate.
    New visitors always get fresh bytes either way. Trading a stamp refresh for
    an unsatisfiable gate is the operator's call, taken deliberately.

    A `.j2` page, a builder, a sweep script, or anything else under templates/
    (`templates/fonts/`, a subdirectory, an unpaired asset) still requires a
    render. So does a paired asset whose `site/` twin is NOT in the same commit:
    that is a one-sided edit the sync gate rejects anyway, and it means the live
    bytes have not moved. Fail-closed on everything the pair list cannot vouch for.

    Second — and this is the same class of false gate, one lane over — #3834
    stopped `templates/**` being one lane at all. The public/marketing surfaces
    were split into `public-render.yml`, and render.yml's push filter now carries
    explicit template negations, while its builder trigger is now a positive
    allowlist that simply omits `scripts/build_public_pages.py`, so the scarce
    self-hosted market renderer is never occupied merely to bake the three
    data-free public pages. For those paths a push-triggered render.yml run
    CANNOT EXIST, so demanding one blocked forever. Observed 2026-07-28 on
    PR #3897 (templates/plans.html.j2 + site/plans.html): merged as 7fe17018,
    public-render.yml run 30349907107 concluded `success` on that exact sha and
    pushed d4ac971df7a, https://www.mastermind-x.com/plans.html was browser-
    verified live in production — and the guard returned `render_pending`
    regardless, with no run it could ever have been waiting for.

    Third, the old `scripts/build_*.py` wildcard admitted 283 top-level builders
    while this workflow executed or transitively imported only 101 of them.
    Changes to nightly collectors, research factories, marketing builders, and
    live-flow producers therefore queued a 50-100 minute render whose body never
    invoked the changed module. render.yml now carries the executable positive
    ownership list. When both workflow filters parse successfully, that list is
    authoritative here too: an unclaimed builder owes no render and cannot leave
    the ship loop waiting on a run GitHub never created.

    So the question is not one bool but which LANE owes the work. A path
    public-render.yml claims and render.yml excludes belongs to
    ``_RENDER_LANE_PUBLIC``, and ``_stop`` satisfies it from that workflow's own
    runs under the same coalescing rule. Ownership is parsed out of both
    workflows at runtime (``_render_lane_filters``) rather than transcribed here,
    so the guard and the split cannot drift; when the parse cannot vouch for a
    path the ownership test goes silent and the heavy lane's demand stands,
    exactly as before the split.

    The pair exemption is applied FIRST and still wins, including for the public
    surfaces it covers. Those bytes are live on the VPS pull with or without any
    lane, the only thing forfeited is the `?v=` re-stamp, and that trade is the
    operator's standing call from #3671 — re-imposing a wait on them through the
    new lane would quietly undo it.

    either the push render at merge_sha or a later successful run on a main
    descendant, per the shared-lane coalescing law. That widens coverage, not
    this requirement, which stays scoped as below.)

    start_head..head was the wrong basis on a shared main: this repo runs many
    concurrent sessions, and a session that syncs its worktree to origin/main
    sweeps every OTHER session's merges into that range. One unrelated
    templates/ merge then demanded a render on a merge commit that could never

    Within that scope, ``_render_lanes_for_paths`` asks the narrower question the
    gate actually cares about: not "would render.yml fire?" but "does this merge
    contain anything a render lane PRODUCES, and which lane?" — see its docstring
    for why a paired plain-copy asset needs neither.

    The pair list and both push filters are read from the worktree, which carries
    this merge's files (the session's branch is what was merged). A worktree that
    cannot answer yields no pairs and no ownership, which requires the heavy

    Memoised because ``_stop`` asks once per lane and the answer is a pure
    function of a merge that cannot change under it: one git diff, one walk of

    the moment a newer merge queues its own. The survivor's scope-union `pick`

    AGENTS.md §"Shared render-lane safety" states exactly this: do not demand a
    dedicated successful run for every merge SHA.

    Requiring `head_sha == merge_sha` therefore made every merge-train member

    with b4449443590 in its history — yet the guard returned ``failed`` forever
    and forced a manual ~50-minute rerun of work already covered.

    Coverage is now (a) a successful push render at merge_sha itself — one API
    call, the common case, unchanged — or (b) a successful later render whose
    head_sha is a main DESCENDANT of merge_sha. Descendants are the only runs
    whose checkout contained the merge; a sibling or pre-merge head rendered a
    tree without it. The ``merged_at`` floor is belt-and-braces (ancestry already
    excludes pre-merge heads, but a re-run of pre-merge history must not read as
    coverage).

    Three non-success verdicts, and only ONE of them blocks Stop:

    - ``deferred`` — a candidate render is IN FLIGHT (queued/running) and covers
      this merge. ``_stop`` treats this as satisfied and falls through to the live
      gate rather than holding the session for the lane to finish. The VPS pulls
      main every 3 minutes independent of Actions, so a merged commit is live in
      minutes regardless; the render lane only re-bakes ``.j2`` pages and the
      ``?v=`` content-hash stamp; house law forbids a waiting session from
      cancelling or re-running the shared lane; and the nightly ``scope=all``
      re-render self-heals a failed lane within a day. Holding a session the
      lane's ~67+ minutes — observed sessions sat 3h46m-4h02m — for work that is
      already live and a lane they may not touch was the single largest by-design
      cost, so an in-flight covering run now DEFERS to the shared coalescing lane
      with the nightly re-render as backstop.
    - ``pending`` — NO run has fired for this merge yet. This is the dead-wire
      trap (a lane that never triggered) and it must still BLOCK: absence of any
      run is not deferral, it is a missing gate.
    - ``failed`` — every candidate has completed, the newest is non-success, and
      nothing is in flight. Actionable and blocking, exactly as before.

    ``workflow`` selects the lane. All of the above holds for the public fast lane
    too, for a different reason that lands in the same place: `public-render.yml`
    runs `cancel-in-progress: TRUE`, so a newer push kills an older run outright —
    but every run checks out `ref: main` and rebuilds the public surfaces from
    scratch, so the survivor's tree already contains every merge it superseded.
    Coalescing by supersession rather than by scope-union, identical coverage
    algebra. Only the remediation wording differs.

    the deploy script restarts on is live the moment /opt/macro's tree carries it,

    `commit` was 70 commits behind, so the gate blocked `live_stale` on a merge

    `commit` stays in the tuple for the pull-only case as a fallback, not as a

# Execution continuation law (2026-09-17). Pure functions, no I/O, no inference.
#
# Every gate below judges the SHIP CHAIN of a session that already produced a commit.
# None of them can see the failure family that ends missions BEFORE that chain is ever
# reached: a session that stops while authorized work remains. Observed repeatedly —
# one blocked review or tool lane treated as the end of the whole mission; a
# checkpoint, status note or continuation record mistaken for the outcome it only
# describes; a
# principal seat spending itself re-polling a queue a durable watcher already owns; a
# delegation surface being unavailable read as "execution is impossible" when lawful
# direct bounded execution remained; accepted work redone with no material
# invalidator; and an upstream acknowledgement reported as though it were START,
# RUNNING, MERGED or ACCEPTANCE.
#
# The guard cannot observe lanes, custody, delegation scope or carriers, and it must
# not try: inferring them would make this hook a control plane, which repository law
# forbids. What it CAN do is exactly two things, and this section is limited to them.
#
# 1. REFUSE one self-declared state. `MORE_WORK_EXISTS` is, by the session's own
#    admission, not a finished mission. The session writes that token itself, so the
#    refusal has no false positives by construction, and `_block`'s any-code ladder
#    (10 consecutive / 15 total) keeps it from ever trapping a session.
# 2. CORRECT the advice every other block carries. The old body said the same
#    sentence on block 1 and on block 25 — "Continue the task and complete
#    commit -> ... -> live verification" — which is exactly what taught sessions to
#    answer a wait with one more poll. `.claude/hooks/gh_quota_guard.py` shape 7
#    documents that mechanism and measured ~25 consecutive Stop cycles of it in one
#    session that already had a watcher armed. A repeat of the same code is a
#    no-delta cycle and now reads as one.
#
# Everything the hook cannot observe stays law rather than code, on the surfaces that
# already carry fleet law: CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md § "Execution continuation law",
# `.cursor/rules/execution-continuation.mdc`, and
# `DEC:EXECUTION-CONTINUATION-INVARIANTS`.

      cumulative arm is what the field forced: a session ping-ponging
      render_pending -> github_rate_limited -> render_pending resets the
      consecutive counter every hop, so `blocker_count >= 2` alone never armed and
      one session refused Stop 245 times on render_failed while genuinely blocked.
    - ANY code (including the internal ones — unmerged/ci_failed_unmerged/unpushed/
      uncommitted/unsafe_branch/guard_error) escapes at 10 CONSECUTIVE or 15 TOTAL
      blocks.
      Internal codes had NO escape at all, which produced an observed 258x infinite
      loop on `unmerged` (a zero-diff stand-down whose chain was unsatisfiable). The
      internal ceiling is deliberately high — it is a last-resort loop breaker, not
      a routine exit — and every earlier gate (the stand-down exemption, the
      deferred-render acceptance below) exists to keep a healthy session from ever
      reaching it.

    `last_blocker`/`blocker_count` track the CONSECUTIVE same-code run and are left
    exactly as they were. `total_blocks` and `external_blocks` are cumulative and
    are NEVER reset within a session, so a ping-pong cannot erase them.

    The ladders are a LAST resort, not the intended exit. The release valves
    upstream of them — the stand-down exemption and the deferred render — exist so
    a healthy session reaches a clean stop and never counts toward a ceiling at
    all. There is deliberately no valve for `unmerged` or `ci_failed_unmerged`: a
    session owns its pull request until the merge lands, and the internal ceiling
    is the only thing that can end that wait early.

    A RATIFIED ladder exit is REMEMBERED for the exact frozen state it excused
    (2026-08-19, operator complaint). ``exit_key`` names one evaluated state —
    today only `ci_failed` on a merged head, keyed
    ``ci_failed:<head_sha>:<merge_sha>:<sha256(reason)[:12]>``. The reason
    digest is load-bearing, not decoration: a merged head's check SET is not
    immutable (a `gh run rerun` or a late-attaching cron can bind a different
    red to the same shas), so the shas alone would let one ratified report
    cover an unbounded family of later, unrelated CI states. Digesting the
    block reason pins the memory to the exact evidence the report answered —
    any different red produces a different reason, a different key, and a fresh
    block, which is the fail-closed direction. Without the memory, a long-lived
    session re-blocked on every subsequent Stop and had to re-file the SAME
    `SHIP LOOP BLOCKED:` report dozens of times (measured on the 2026-08-19
    authority-frozen main-red-repair session). The memory records an exit key
    ONLY at the moment an escape actually fires — which itself required the
    full evidence report on a re-entrant Stop — and a later block carrying a
    remembered key passes through without bumping any counter. A DIFFERENT key
    (new PR, new merge, new evidence) never matches, internal codes never carry
    a key, and an unratified block records nothing, so no ladder widens: the
    report is demanded once per frozen state instead of once per Stop.

    The exemption above this one catches a session that never moved. A stand-down
    session — one assigned a defect that turns out to be already fixed on main,
    the common shape under the duplicate-fixes playbook — DOES move: it runs
    `git reset --hard origin/main` to verify the fix at tip before concluding,
    which walks HEAD off start_head while creating zero commits of its own.

    From there the full chain is unsatisfiable. GitHub refuses a zero-diff pull
    request ("No commits between main and <branch>"), and `unmerged` is not in
    EXTERNAL_BLOCKERS, so the repeated-blocker `SHIP LOOP BLOCKED:` escape never
    arms. Observed 2026-07-26 on claude/serene-colden-e5b716: the only exit was
    resetting BACK to start_head to re-qualify for the no-op exemption — a
    non-obvious and wasteful ritual for a session that verified and built nothing.

    Fail-closed, and the fetch is load-bearing. Ancestry has to be judged against
    origin's CURRENT tip, never a stale local ref this worktree happened to keep,
    so a fetch that does not SUCCEED means the exemption simply does not apply and
    the ordinary chain takes over — whose GitHub-side failures are escapable
    external blockers, so nothing is trapped by going offline. The ancestry test
    and the zero-ahead count are belt-and-braces statements of one claim; both
    must hold, and every git failure — a failed fetch, rc=1 for "not an ancestor",
    rc=128 for an origin/main this checkout cannot name — reads as "not exempt".

    Shipped sessions are untouched: a squash merge mints a NEW sha, so a merged
    branch head is never an ancestor of origin/main and still falls through to the
    merged-PR, CI, render, and live verification exactly as before.

    The branch gate must run BEFORE this, and that ordering is load-bearing rather
    than cosmetic. Ancestry proves POSITION, never authorship: a session that
    synced to someone else's fix and a session that committed its own work on main
    and pushed it straight to origin/main both end with HEAD equal to origin's tip
    and a zero ahead-count, and nothing here can tell them apart. The second one
    genuinely shipped something, so exempting it would skip the render and live
    gates on live work — fail-open, which this guard may never be. Running the
    branch check first leaves that session blocking on `unsafe_branch` and makes
    the exemption reachable only from a claude/* worktree branch, where a zero
    ahead-count really does mean nothing shippable exists.

    The stand-down exemption needs this because ``_fast_forwarded_onto_main``

    with a zero ahead-count: it pushed real commits, opened a pull request, and
    then ran `git reset --hard origin/main` to look at main while waiting.
    `reset --hard` moves the LOCAL branch ref, so those commits survive only on
    the remote — the worktree looks exactly like a stand-down while an unmerged
    pull request is still open. A branch that was never pushed cannot be in that
    state: no pull request of ours can exist, so nothing is waiting on CI,

    Both halves are needed. `@{upstream}` alone misses
    `git push origin HEAD:<branch>`, which sets no upstream but does update the

    nothing in practice but is the cheaper, more direct question, so it is asked
