/* ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   PROPHET OPERATOR LAB — the R5 controller (D-LAB-R5)

   This file is the mockup stand-in for LAB-0 §6.5's ONE `ProphetBoardController`:
   the sole painter of the principal grid, holding `desiredMode`, `labSelection`,
   `labClass` and the Lab payload. It is ADDITIVE — board.js (the frozen R4
   reference) is loaded unmodified and is still the only thing that paints LIVE.

   THREE LAWS THIS FILE EXISTS TO MAKE TRUE, not merely to assert:

   1. LAB → LIVE re-derives the live board from the CURRENT source; it never
      restores a pre-LAB snapshot. `repaintLive()` destroys the board subtree
      and RE-EXECUTES board.js, so a LIVE page after a Lab excursion is
      produced by the same code path as a cold load — there is no cached DOM
      that could be stale. The harness prints the repaint count so the
      behaviour is observable rather than claimed.

   2. A fresh page ALWAYS defaults LIVE. The mode control never writes the URL
      or storage; `desiredMode` is in-memory. `?mode=lab` is a HARNESS lens for
      hand inspection only, and tools/capture.py CLICKS the control instead of
      using it (R4's own standard: a capability that only exists after a click
      cannot be evidenced by a URL).

   3. LAB stale / empty / unavailable stays visibly LAB. There is no code path
      from a degraded Lab feed to LIVE content under a LAB label: when the feed
      has nothing, the Lab says so in its own voice and names what still works.

   The Lab has zero authority (LAB-0 §1): this file reads, filters, joins and
   decorates. It mints nothing, ranks nothing, and cannot reach Prophet state.

     in both states and six pills asserted a literal 0 sourced from a feed that

     failure the nulls-printed law exists to stop — and it was worse here than
     elsewhere because the empty state one flip away explicitly teaches the
     reader that these zeros are trustworthy ("a real zero, not a gap").

     The two states are now separate facts everywhere they surface: the pill
     counts, the split, the row count, and the copy. R4 solved the same problem
     at the count-cell level (its Watch cell prints an em dash plus a disclosure
     line when the key is ABSENT, and a muted 0 when the count is genuinely

    /* ── R5.2 / R52-D1 — THE RAIL IS A UNIT LABEL, NOT A CLASS ASSERTION ────
       R5.1 withdrew the 23 per-row seed chips under Law 4 and then kept
       printing "signal date / not a sighting" on all 23 rows, so the constant
       VTL-408 targeted survived the fix that was supposed to remove it. The
       second line was the constant: `not a sighting` asserts CLASS MEMBERSHIP,
       identically, on every row it appears on, and that assertion is exactly
       what the pinned divider now carries once.

       The first line stays, and the distinction is the whole argument. `signal
       date` and `first seen` are UNIT LABELS: they name what the number
       directly above them IS, and without them the stream prints two kinds of
       timestamp in one column with nothing saying which is which. That is the
       ratified self-labelling-token pattern
       (doctrine §3, "the state token IS the label"), and it is the closest
       thing a single interleaved stream has to a column header — a table would
       spend one header cell on it, and this stream cannot, because the two
       kinds alternate. Deleting them too would not be honesty, it would be an
       unlabelled number.

       R5.3 / VTL52-608 — THE CRITERION ABOVE WAS STATED WRONG, and the wrong
       version does not discriminate. R5.2 wrote that a rail earns its place
       because it "DIFFERS between adjacent rows"; the PROPHET eyebrow four
       cells over is identical on all 30 rows and is obviously legitimate, so
       varying text was never the test. What actually separates the two is
       WHAT THE STRING DOES. A LABEL names a neighbouring value and is read WITH
       it — delete it and a number loses its unit, so it is not a repetition of
       information, it is the information's name. A CLAIM asserts a fact about
       the row, and once a structure states that fact for a whole region, every
       per-row copy is the Law 4 repetition. `signal date` labels the date above
       it; `not a sighting` claimed a class; `Lead not measurable` claimed the
       consequence of that class. The two claims went; the labels stayed. The
       criterion is label-vs-claim, and it holds for the eyebrow too — `Prophet`
       names the column that follows it.

       D6i pins the split: the class assertion must appear EXACTLY ONCE in the
       stream, no row rail may make one, and (R5.3 / D6i4) no CLAUSE may repeat
       on every seed row at all. M23 puts the per-row rail constant back and M29
       the lead-slot one; both are caught there. */

       that had already established the fact for everything under it, which is
       per-row repetition of a constant (doctrine Law 4).

       It is not simply deleted, because the reason it existed is real: a reader
       deep in the seed region, mid-scroll at 390w, cannot see a divider that is
       2,000px above them. So the DIVIDER ITSELF pins — for exactly as long as
       any seed row is on screen — and carries the class name in the seed
       treatment, so the label is present whenever it applies and printed once
       instead of 23 times. The signature device does the work the repetition
       was doing.

       R5.2 / PR51-1: at R5.1 that paragraph was true of the intent and false of
       the artifact — `.lab-stream`'s `overflow: hidden` made the pin inert, so
       the chips were withdrawn against a mechanism that never fired. The clip
       moved off the list and D6c3 now proves the pin by scrolling past it.

       Four independent channels still separate the classes ON the row: dashed
       spine, hollow node, the "signal date / not a sighting" rail, and the
       "Lead not measurable" slot. The live rows keep their chip — there are
       seven of them, above the divider, and it is not a constant there. */

       (filter) — 实时 / 实时观测 / 实时观测 — and a reader had to infer from
       position which "live" was which.

       The class is now "Seen first-hand" / 「第一手观测」, which shares nothing
       with the mode word in either language. It is not a rename for its own
       sake: the axis this class actually measures is PROVENANCE, not timing —
       did we watch it arrive, or are we reading it back out of the record — and
       "first-hand" is the plain word for that. It also makes the pair

  /* ── THE LEAD SLOT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     R5.1 / VTL-403 — SYMMETRY. The R5 version had two defects that pointed the
     same way, and both are fixed here:

       1. `Math.abs(r.lead)` ran BEFORE the sign was ever inspected, so a signed
          -2 would have printed "Seen 2 days before Prophet" in accent ink. The
          only thing preventing it was the generator's habit of writing null for
          adverse cases — a convention standing in for a guard. The sign is now
          the branch, `Math.abs` is gone, and the fixture emits signed leads so
          the adverse and same-day branches are real and photographed.

       2. A measured ADVERSE result ("Prophet was first") wore the same muted,
          dashed idiom as a genuinely UNMEASURABLE one (a seed). Those are
          different facts: one is a measurement that came out against us, the
          other is the absence of any measurement. They now use different
          treatments, and MEASUREMENTS SHARE ONE INK regardless of which way
          they came out — favourable and adverse are distinguished by the WORD
          and the NUMBER, never by loudness. `.lab-lead` no longer carries a
          tinted background or accent ink; verify D19c pins the two to the same
          computed colour so a future edit cannot quietly re-amplify one side.

     Only a true live-forward observation may carry a measured number at all
     (LAB-0 §4). Every non-measured case still prints WHY there is none — an
     empty slot would read as "zero lead", which is a claim nobody made. */

       "Lead not measurable" was printed on all 23 seed rows below a pinned

       defect this reference has now fixed three times (the chip at R5.1, the
       rail at R5.2, this slot at R5.3), and R5.2 shipped it with both acceptance
       gates drawn around it: D6g counted filled slots, D6i counted badges, and
       neither could see a sentence repeated 23 times.

       The slot keeps its element, its LENS and its accessible name — this is not
       a deletion — and prints the artifact's OWN null idiom instead of a
       sentence: an em dash in a dashed outline, exactly what `.lab-n--unk` uses
       one component up for "we hold no answer" and never for a real zero. The
       statement itself moves to the one place that is on screen for as long as
       it applies: the PINNED strip, merged into the sentence already there
       rather than stacked beside it.

       Why a glyph is honest here and would not be in isolation: the pin
       guarantees the governing clause is in the viewport whenever any row it
       governs is (D6c3), so the dash is a pointer to a stated fact rather than
       an unlabelled blank. D6g still forbids an EMPTY slot, D6g2 requires the
       accessible name, and D6i4 widens the constant gate from one badge to any

     R5 read LAB-0 §6.5 as a page mode and hid the page subtitle, the ladder,

     that a contract breach: "the principal Prophet grid" is a NARROWING clause
     naming one region of a page that demonstrably has others, and two of the
     hidden sections are core baseline capabilities. A page-level mode would not
     have been written as "grid".

     R5.1 paints `#setups` and NOTHING else. The page header, the plan book's
     own as-of, its behind-the-tape banner, the ladder, Candidates, Groups,
     Evidence & Record and the footer all survive the mode, because they
     describe the plan book and the plan book is still on the page.

     The authority-hygiene worry that motivated the over-reach is real, and it
     is answered the way the ruling says to answer it — by SEPARATION, not
     deletion. The Lab renders inside a bounded, labelled region with its own
     accent boundary, eyebrow and feed stamp, and closes with an explicit

       mid-flip and the browser drops focus to <body>. Measured on R5.2: a
       keyboard operator who pressed "Live" had to re-tab the whole page to
       reach the one control this surface has, which made LAB->LIVE strictly
       harder to operate than LIVE->LAB. The intent was already stated ("arrow
       keys move within the radiogroup") and was only half true.

       So the flip remembers whether focus was IN the control before the
       teardown and returns it to the RE-MOUNTED control once board.js has
       painted — the same identity, not merely the same coordinates. It is

     `top: 0` encodes "this route has no page header", and the production route
     ships the shared site nav. Rather than hardcode either answer, the
     controller MEASURES the sticky chrome above the grid once per paint and
     binds `--lab-mark-top`, so one component is correct on a page with a header
     and on one without.

     R5.3 / PR52-1 — WHAT THIS COMMENT SAID AT R5.2 WAS FALSE, and the seam is
     now real. R5.2 asserted "its own harness bar is a real sticky element, so
     with ?chrome=1 the divider pins BELOW it". Measured at 1440 with chrome=1:
     the bar's own top was −2,637px — it had scrolled entirely off screen —
     while the divider pinned at 149px, so what `chrome=1` actually produced was
     149px of EMPTY BAND above the pin and a check that could not tell the
     difference. `.harness` declares `position: sticky` inside `#harness`, whose
     height is exactly the bar's own height, and a sticky box cannot travel
     outside its containing block. The declaration was true; the layout it lived
     in made it inert — the same defect class as PR51-1's `overflow: hidden`,
     one axis over, and this time it was asserted three times in prose.

     `lab.css` now gives the bar a containing block with travel, so it pins for
     real; D6c4 asserts the BAR'S POSITION at the pin moment (barTop ≈ 0) rather
     than merely its height, which is what let the false premise pass. With
     `?chrome=1` the divider pins BELOW a bar that is genuinely on screen and
     with `?chrome=0` it pins at 0 — two correct answers from one rule.
     Production adds its header to the selector list (or marks it
     `data-lab-sticky-chrome`) and changes nothing else. */

  /* ── R5.2 / R52-D2 — LANDING THE REGION, AND WHY THIS IS NOT A HIJACK ─────
     Measured at 390x844: the first observation began at 1,009px and stands
     294px tall, so nothing complete was above the fold. The two structures
     ahead of it are frozen (the ladder by R51-M1, the six selectors by C4) and
     account for 432px, so compression alone cannot reach the 550px a complete
     row needs — the region has to be LANDED.

     The rule is self-scoping rather than breakpoint-scoped: land only when the
     first observation would otherwise fall below the fold. At 1440 that is
     never true and nothing moves; at 390 it is always true and the region
     arrives at the top of the screen.

     Three properties keep this a navigation and not a viewport hijack, which is
     a standing operator veto:
       * it fires ONLY on a deliberate mode flip — never on load, never on a
         board or filter change, never ambiently;
       * the control the reader just pressed re-mounts into the Lab modebar,
         which is exactly what lands at the top, so their eye does not lose it;
       * flipping back to LIVE restores the scroll position they flipped FROM,
         so the excursion leaves the page where it found it.
     The scroll is instant, so there is no motion to suppress under
     prefers-reduced-motion.

     R5.3 / PR52-2 — THE LANDING OWES THE SAME OFFSET THE PIN DOES. R5.2 landed
     the band at `bandTop` flat, while `syncMarkOffset` two functions up was
     already measuring the sticky chrome for the divider. On any route whose
     header actually pins — which after PR52-1 includes this mockup at
     `?chrome=1` — that put the modebar UNDER the chrome: the reader pressed a
     control and the surface scrolled it out of sight behind the header, which
     is the exact failure D24b exists to forbid, in the one configuration D24b
     never ran. One measurement serves both: the pin and the landing read the
     same `--lab-mark-top`, so a route cannot be correct for one and wrong for
     the other. D24/D24b now run at chrome=1 as well as chrome=0. */

     none of it — there is no hover, and the only way to raise `focusin` on a
     `tabindex="0"` span is a keyboard the reader does not have. R5.2 then hung
     three <=560 demotions off that LENS (the sort basis, the board subtitle,
     the lead total), so at the design floor the landings existed in the DOM and
     could not be reached by the only gesture available. A demotion whose
     landing cannot be opened is a deletion.

     board.js is the frozen R4 reference and may not be edited, so the path is
     added HERE, additively, over the same `.lens-pop` element and the same
     `data-tip-*` attributes — one popover, one vocabulary, no second tooltip
     system. Tap opens; tapping the same carrier again, tapping anywhere else,
     pressing Escape, or flipping the mode closes it. `pointerdown` on the
     document does the dismiss so a tap that lands on the page body is caught
     before it becomes a click somewhere else.

     Scoped to `.lab-plane` on purpose: the Lab owns the tips inside its own
     region, and reaching outside it to re-bind the plan book's would be this
     controller taking over a surface it does not paint. D28 drives it under
     `pointer: coarse`; M30 removes it. */
