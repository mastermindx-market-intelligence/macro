# `mockups/refs/prophet_live/` — Prophet Live P1 reference mockups

Committed look-reference for the P1 us_stocks surfaces. **Spec:
`research/PROPHET_LIVE_P1_DESIGN_SPEC.md`** — that document is what the builder implements;
these files are what it must end up looking like.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `strip.html` | The mockup itself. Self-contained: theme tokens copied verbatim from `templates/theme.css`, strip CSS verbatim from spec §3, prophet-card CSS verbatim from `_prophet_card.html.j2`'s `pv_css()` plus the new `.pv-live` chip (spec §5.3). **This file, not the PNGs, is the authoritative reference** — it carries the exact CSS. |
| `build_refs.py` | Playwright shot harness for the MOCKUP. `python3 mockups/refs/prophet_live/build_refs.py`. Also prints the height-invariance proof. |
| `shots/*.png` | 2× crops of the mockup: `{specimen}_{theme}_{lang}.png`, plus `_mobile_` at 375px. |
| **`verify_p1.py`** | **Acceptance harness for the SHIPPED build** (added with the P1 PR). Renders the real `dashboard.html.j2` with the real `us_standouts.json`, serves `site/` over loopback so the page's own `fetch('live/prophet_live.json')` resolves, freezes the ET clock per specimen, and drives the production JS path. Prints the five proofs and exits non-zero on any failure, so it doubles as a pre-push gate. |
| `p1_shots/*.png` | 2× crops from `verify_p1.py` — the shipped surface, not the mockup. Includes `strip_closed` and `strip_overflow`, which the mockup has no specimen for. |

## Which numbers to trust

The mockup's height numbers (231.25 / 233.25 / 284.34px) do **not** carry over: the real
page inherits `line-height:1.5` where the mockup inherited `normal`, so a baseline-aligned
row measures 26.06px there against 24.5px here. The shipped build pins the row height and
derives the body reservation from it (`--plv-rh`). `verify_p1.py` is the source of truth
for the shipped surface; re-run it, never quote the mockup.

The panel's height is **constant across modes at every width** but varies BY width (the
copy wraps differently): 243.25px from 700px up, rising to 369.09px at 320px in en. Quote
the matrix `verify_p1.py` prints, not a single number.

## Height invariance is a SWEEP, not three measurements

`HEIGHT_WIDTHS` × {en, zh} × **every specimen the harness defines**, and the run exits
non-zero on any variance.

Both halves of that sentence are scar tissue, and the gate narrowed twice:

1. The width list was hardcoded to the three configurations the PR body happened to quote,
   so it could only ever agree with the claim being made. It passed while the panel shoved
   the board by up to **32.75px** at nine other widths.
2. The mode list was then hand-written and omitted `strip_noread` — the one specimen added
   that round, and the one still shoving (**17.00px** at 320/340 en, from the `#plv-asof`
   box). "308 measurements, variance 0.00" and an independent reviewer's "17.00px" were
   both true at the same time.

So: `modes` is **derived** from the specimen dict (a new specimen joins the sweep by
existing — a specimen that is not swept is a crop that lies), and `HEIGHT_WIDTHS` is pinned
by length and membership in `tests/test_prophet_live_surface.py`, because a prose comment
saying "never trim this back" is not a guard. Mutating the list to `(375, 1180)` used to
leave the whole suite green.

Four boxes vary with the mode — `.plv-token`, `.plv-sub`, `.plv-fn`, `.plv-asof` — and all
four are fixed the same structural way rather than with per-breakpoint numbers: every
variant stays in the DOM stacked in one grid cell with `visibility:hidden`, so the browser
reserves the worst case at whatever width and language it renders. If you add a mode or
change any of that copy, re-run — do not re-measure by hand.

## Specimens

| `data-shot` | Shows |
|---|---|
| `strip_live` | 2 forming + 1 holding-into-close, 15:41 ET (the brief's headline case) |
| `strip_faded` | 1 forming + `ran past` + `fell back` + the `+1 more` overflow button — the two `via` stories side by side, which must never share a word |
| `strip_quiet` | quiet tape: live, nothing crossing. The rail is the proof of life |
| `strip_dark` | data dark (`stale_pack`): rail greyed, cause named in plain words, board unaffected |
| `cards` | board panel with `◐ Below range` on a **Buy** card next to the nightly `⚡` (the hue exception, spec §5.1), `◐ Holding into close` on a Near card, and an untouched control card proving the reserved slot adds nothing |

Data is production-shaped: board rows (TPR / FAST / LEA, prices, zones, sectors, dates) come
from `site/factordata/us_standouts.json` `as_of 2026-07-28`. The strip's cross names
(ONTO / MLI / CRS) are real scored-universe names that are deliberately **not** on that
board — which is exactly what the strip exists to surface.

## Height invariance (spec §6.4 rule 1)

Measured on this mockup across all four modes (live / faded+overflow / quiet / dark):

| Width | Language | Height, every mode |
|---|---|---|
| 1180px | en | **231.25px** |
| 1180px | zh | **233.25px** |
| 375px | en | **284.34px** |

Three separate CSS rules earn that, and **each was added after a measurement caught it
failing** — the first draft was off by 10.5px (row height guessed at 21px, actually 24.5px),
then 2.5px (a short token shrank a wrapped header line), then 21px on mobile (the `+N more`
button jumped to a third header line the moment a 4th row appeared). Re-measure after any
change to the chip box, the header, or the row grid; do not take the number on trust.

## Rasterizer caveats in these PNGs

The PNGs in `shots/` were produced in an environment where Playwright and the Chrome CLI
could not launch, via `foreignObject` → canvas in the Browser pane. Two artifacts are
present in the committed crops and are **not** design decisions:

1. **Card sparklines are missing.** Nested `<svg>` inside `foreignObject` does not
   rasterize. The live browser render draws them normally.
2. **Crops narrower than 680px collapse chips to the bare `◐` glyph**, because the media
   query resolves against the crop width. This is why only panel-width crops are committed;
   per-card crops taken in isolation misrepresent the desktop design.

Re-running `build_refs.py` on any host with a working browser produces clean crops without
either artifact. The acceptance crops for the build PR (spec §7) come from the real page via
Playwright, not from this harness.
