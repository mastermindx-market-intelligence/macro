"""W4 visual gate — browser-driven crops of the REAL per-ticker Intelligence Drawer.

Same discipline as the W2 and W3 harnesses beside it, and the same refusal to stage
anything: every shot renders `templates/watchlist.html.j2` through the builder's own
context, runs the page's OWN scripts against the REAL nightly artifacts in `site/`, and
seeds only a BOOK (and a watchlist) in localStorage — the stores a real visitor's state
lives in. Every sentence in these crops is the page composing over those artifacts.

WHAT THIS WAVE'S HARNESS HAS TO CATCH THAT THE LAST ONE DID NOT. W3 learned that a bare
agent worktree has no `site/stockdata/`, so the page degrades exactly as designed and
photographs as a working page with a thin book. W4's drawer degrades the same way, one
level finer: EVERY SECTION has an honest-absence line, so a drawer with no artifacts
behind it renders thirteen beautifully-worded rows that all say "not covered". That is
the wave's own success criterion rendering as a total data failure — the most persuasive
false green available to this build. So the gate asserts BOTH directions:

  * the rich name's drawer must contain AT MOST `RICH_MAX_NA` absent rows, and
  * the sparse name's drawer must contain AT LEAST `SPARSE_MIN_NA` — and some real ones.

Both thresholds are measured, not chosen — and the run PRINTS the inventory it measured
them from (`INVENTORY` lines, first variant only), so the README beside this file quotes
a number this script emitted rather than a number somebody remembered. The composer
emits 15 rows; a HOLDINGS drawer adds Stage from `portfolio.js`, so scenes 02/03 are 16
rows and the watchlist scene 04 is 15.

A run where every row is honest is a run with no data, and it exits non-zero.

Also asserted rather than eyeballed: no page errors; zero PAGE-level horizontal scroll
at 390px with a drawer open (the drawer is the widest thing on the page); the anonymous
drawer is a lock shell carrying no lane rows at all; and the drawer opens from BOTH
modes' rows, which is the acceptance row a screenshot of one mode cannot prove.

Run:  python3 mockups/refs/psi/workspace/crops/impl/w4/shoot_w4_crops.py
Needs a browser (playwright) and the repo's own site/ artifacts — hand-run, for the
reason recorded in ../IMPLEMENTATION_DELTAS.md: the CI packs install a minimal
dependency set, so a pytest wrapper here would SKIP in CI and report green while proving
nothing. The node-shelled half of this wave's evidence is `tests/test_watchlist_drawer_js.py`,
which DOES run in CI.

# ownership filings") was falsified by the crop itself: the stub has those KEYS but not
# the fields the rows read, so both rendered n/a.

# and 1 evaluated-negative; AAPL's renders 15 real and 1 gap. Only the GAP counts are
# asserted (the bounds below); the rest is printed per scene by `print_inventory` so the
# README beside this file can quote a measurement rather than a memory.
# `assert_not_stub_grade` refuses the class of file that made the first attempt
# meaningless.
#
# The counts are `.st.na` ONLY — the coverage-gap mark. Since m8 split the three coverage
# meanings apart, `none` (we looked; the answer is none) and `n/app` (does not apply here)
# are ANSWERS and count as real rows.
