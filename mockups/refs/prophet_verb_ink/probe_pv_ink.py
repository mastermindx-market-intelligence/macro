"""Prophet-card verb INK probe — every verb, both themes, both languages.

    python3 mockups/refs/prophet_verb_ink/probe_pv_ink.py
    python3 mockups/refs/prophet_verb_ink/probe_pv_ink.py --near-mix 56%   # sweep a candidate
    python3 mockups/refs/prophet_verb_ink/probe_pv_ink.py --avoid-mix 100% # ditto, dark avoid
    python3 mockups/refs/prophet_verb_ink/probe_pv_ink.py --shoot avoid88  # + swatch PNGs

Both sweep flags take the mix percentage, never a "before"/"after" word, and 100%
is how the pass-through state is expressed — so a swept state is always named by
the value that produced it and a crop cannot claim a side of a fix it did not
render. ``--near-mix`` overrides the light+zh selector the Near fix edits;
``--avoid-mix`` overrides ``:root``, the selector the dark Avoid fix edits.

Why this exists as its own harness rather than a crop off a board: the defect it
was built for is a TOKEN defect, and no shipped board carries all five verbs at
once (the us_stocks board renders buy/near/wait and no hold/avoid). Measuring the
token plane directly is the only way to see all 5 × 2 themes × 2 languages, and
it is the plane the fix edits.

It is NOT a mockup. Both stylesheets are the shipping ones, unmodified:

  · ``templates/theme.css`` is inlined verbatim — that is where every ``--pv-*``
    hue, every ``--ink-pv-*`` mix and the ``html[data-lang="zh"]`` 红涨绿跌 swap
    live, and the inks resolve at ``html`` scope, so the probe sets the same two
    attributes production sets (``data-theme`` / ``data-lang``).
  · the card CSS is the real ``pv_css()`` macro from
    ``templates/_prophet_card.html.j2``, RENDERED through Jinja rather than
    regex-scraped, so the jinja comments inside the ``<style>`` block resolve the
    way the page resolves them and the rules measured are byte-identical to the
    rules shipped.

Every rule that prints a verb hue AS TEXT is measured — the set was taken by
grepping ``var(--pvh-ink)`` rather than by picking the obvious two, because a
consumer nobody measured is exactly how the defect this was built for survived:

  · ``.pv-chip``  — 10px/800 uppercase, on ``color-mix(--pvh 13%, --panel)``.
    ``.pv-buy`` inverts this (solid ink fill, ``--panel`` text) and is measured
    in its inverted form, because that is the pair a reader actually sees.
  · ``.pv-edn``   — 14px/800 tabular Edge number, on the card's ``--panel2``.
  · ``.pv-znl``   — 9.5px/800 zone label, on the ``.pv-zn`` footer's own
    ``color-mix(--panel 55%, --bg)`` — a THIRD surface, neither panel nor panel2.
  · ``.pv-trg``   — 10px/800 target pill, on a 9% tint (thinner than the chip's
    13%, so it is a strictly harder surface and cannot be inferred from it).

All are SMALL text under WCAG (9.5–14px bold is nowhere near the 18.66px-bold
large-text threshold), so the floor is 4.5:1, not 3.0:1.

``cn_limit_picks.html.j2`` also reads ``--pvh-ink`` but rebinds it to
``--prov-ink``/``--ink-warn``, so it never resolves a ``--ink-pv-*`` token and is
out of this probe's scope.

Compositing is done by walking each node's ancestors and layering every
non-transparent background, because ``getComputedStyle`` reports a translucent
background as authored, not as painted — measuring text against ``rgba(...)``
directly is measuring the authored value and not the pixel.

``_rgb``/``_over``/``ratio`` are imported from the breathing-platform shooter
rather than retyped. Its ``color(srgb …)`` branch is load-bearing: Chromium
serialises every ``color-mix()`` result as 0..1 floats, and this palette is
almost entirely ``color-mix``, so a naive parse crushes every mixed colour to
near-zero luminance and reports a uniform ~1.00:1 — a catastrophic-looking
failure that is purely a parser artifact.

Exit code is non-zero when any measured pair lands under AA, so this doubles as
a pre-push gate.
