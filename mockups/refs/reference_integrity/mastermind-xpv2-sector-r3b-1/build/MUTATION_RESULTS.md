# R3B1-14 — mutation suite results

Candidate: `proposal/MASTERMIND_SECTOR_CENTRAL_R3_CANDIDATE.html`. Every mutation below is applied to an in-memory COPY of the built candidate inside a throwaway temp directory; the real proposal file is never touched.

**Pristine baseline green:** YES

## Pairwise distinctness

All mutations produced pairwise-distinct failing-check sets — no two capabilities collapse to the same red.


## Method

Each mutation targets the exact JS source construct Lane A/B restored for that capability (a return-early guard, a ternary condition forced false, or a literal string fragment blanked) — the built candidate embeds the view partials' JS source verbatim, so the mutation operates on the same bytes the browser executes, not on the fixture or the producer contract. `destination_family_basket` instead does a global byte substitution of the literal `basket/` prefix, proving direction 2 (candidate -> allowed) catches a stripped destination family, not only direction 1's hero-copy pins.
