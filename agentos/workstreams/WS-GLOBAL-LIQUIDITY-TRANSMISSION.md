key: GLOBAL-LIQUIDITY-TRANSMISSION
title: Global Liquidity Transmission perception lobe
objective: >
  Build the governed measurement plane specified by Mastermind issue #117 without
  acquiring trading authority. Done means the state producer, downstream reader,
  causal transmission lab, and accepted product surface each pass their separately
  commissioned gates with explicit point-in-time and quality receipts.

landmines:
  - "The existing engine/global_liquidity.py uses JPNASSETS provider labels directly; do not reuse its monthly timestamp kernel for causal work."
  - "Availability lag is not a vintage archive: ECB and BoJ historical revisions remain a declared limitation."
  - "A null global credit impulse is the correct result until comparable release-stamped coverage exists; never coerce US C&I and China TSF into one scalar."
do_not_redo:
  - "Do not add a second global-liquidity collector before re-running the committed census against existing stores."
  - "Do not revive discontinued EZ/JP/KR/GB M2 parquets or admit China M2/NFCI/ANFCI into the causal state without a governed vintage solution."
  - "Do not build W-LIQ.2 or later waves from this Macro producer PR; issue #123 gives Sol cross-repo sequencing and acceptance authority."
next_action: Sol reviews and either accepts the W-LIQ.1 schema/PIT limitations or specifies a bounded repair before commissioning W-LIQ.2.

## Boundary

The Global Liquidity Transmission system is a perception lobe. W-LIQ.1 owns
state measurement and receipts only. The later shock, curve, gap, product, and
learning waves remain unstarted and cannot infer authority from the presence of
the state artifact.

## Current result

W-LIQ.1 is code- and evidence-complete, with a causal weekly backfill through
2026-08-21 and an explicitly weak research-only BTC comparison. It is awaiting
Sol review under Mastermind issue #123 and is not merged, deployed, or accepted.
