title: Prophet US V4 — recovery, early discovery & intelligence graph OS
objective: >
  Migrate Prophet US from a late-confirmation board to an early-discovery,
  present-entry, intelligence-ranked research OS. Done means the Chairman opens
  Prophet V4 in production and sees: every owed session settled (or explicitly
  unavailable), early expert evidence before slow confirmation, deterministic
  server-authoritative entry availability where green means only ENTRY_OPEN, an
  explainable missing-aware intelligence rank inside availability lanes, a
  complete searchable All Candidates field with no producer cap, cohort-honest
  grading of every episode, and the frozen V3 algorithm accruing as
  us_prophet_v3_legacy_shadow on the same tape.

landmines:
  - "THE OUTAGE was LIVE at 0A (2026-08-17) and still unresolved at the 0B pin
    (2026-08-18T00Z: source_asof=2026-08-13, 206 plans). That historical fact is
    preserved. A1 is now RESOLVED by adoption of A1R #6320 plus the ordinary scheduled
    run 32786919396 and private served-byte proof on 2026-08-25. Exact receipts and the
    unrelated late Marketing cancellation boundary are indexed in
    agentos/handoffs/PROPHET-US-V4-RECOVERY-2026-08-25-a1-acceptance.md."
  - "Prophet index top-level asof is WALL-CLOCK (DSC:PROPHET-ASOF-IS-WALL-CLOCK);
    freshness = source_asof + per-plan cohorts. Run conclusions decouple from Prophet
    delivery in both directions (DSC:CANCELLED-DAILY-RUN-CAN-STILL-DELIVER-PROPHET)."
  - "Pages can diverge from git in BOTH directions: designed conservatism
    (daily.yml:5046-5092, Pages lags one cycle) AND the measured 08-16 violation
    (run 31913143619 — Pages served the first v3 board git never got; mechanics
    unresolved from source). Production is the VPS, not Pages."
  - "The served board and the plan book have different gates: build_stock_library.py
    writes us_standouts.json directly; prophet_bridge.select_candidates() is a
    downstream consumer that refuses buy_soon. FOUR stage derivations disagree on the
    page (CURRENT_STATE §8). One server contract is B3's job."
  - "PAID BOUNDARY (scoped, 0B): #5840 merged the ranked-board server-side split
    (free shell + premium remainder; PROVEN_LIVE at the 0B pin — VPS premiumdata 401,
    3-row anonymous shell, render receipt 5232c4c4). Per #5840's OWN scope, Act-Now,
    .topsetups, ran, and theme-tape member names REMAIN DOM-gated — residual
    commercial-boundary debt. Do not write 'all Prophet anonymous leakage fixed'."
  - "Vocabulary collisions: Radar G0/C1-C5 vs Fusion arena rungs C1-C5 vs
    prophet_arena C0-C7 execution policies vs audit C0-C4; two same-named 'arena'
    systems; _v2 paths are SCHEMA versions, not the v2 ranker era; two 'board history'
    stores. Disambiguation table: CURRENT_STATE §9 — binding on every handoff."
  - "TURN WATCH is owned by this WS and its canonical artifacts are current at
    data_session=2026-08-24 after the accepted A1 natural run. The page is still NOT
    BUILT and the engine copy still has zero template consumers; artifact freshness is
    not B5B product proof."
  - "MP-1 (research/migration_packets/MP-1-prophet-board.md) is design-ratified with
    all spawn gates satisfied and NOT executed — B5/E2 build against it; its
    population re-source must be checked against DNR:KILL-PROPHET-POP-MERGE first."
  - "QLedger's control leg has never been populated on any of 46,630 claims
    (DSC:NO-QLEDGER-CLAIM-EVER-CARRIED-A-CONTROL-LEG); the plan ledger has no
    benchmark column. Do not describe V4 grading as control-matched until wired."
  - "Radar W4 activation proof is structurally owed (operator arm of
    ENTRY_RADAR_LIVE_ENABLE); B-15..B-19 dispositions post-#5370-heal are UNKNOWN —
    B2 opens with the matrix, do not assume the heal closed them."
do_not_redo:
  - "D5 v1 does NOT mutate or widen engine/us_context_vector.py; Context Vector is a
    read/reference-only PIT history/research substrate for D5."
  - "An unbuilt D5 adapter emits no evidence-family envelope. Adapter readiness may accrue
    outside evidence_families[], but missing/unbuilt is never zero or neutral."
  - "Runtime D5 requires the owner-issued canonical prophet.candidate_episode/v1 from B1.
    Never alias mastermind.live_entry_episode.v1 or mint ticker/date surrogate episodes."
  - "Do not read Earnings decision-time evidence through read_event_workspace /
    read_current_event_workspace. They resolve the CURRENT generation and take no as-of
    argument, so they present post-cut corrected values as decision-time belief while passing
    the contracts stated admissibility test. Decision-time access is
    read_event_source_revisions / read_all_event_source_revisions only."
  - "Do not admit an Earnings revision on source_available_at alone. Admission is the
    CONJUNCTION source_available_at <= cut AND observed_at <= cut, because the owner enforces
    only observed_at >= source_available_at (events.py:249-252), so a filing available before
    the cut but observed after it is a legal state and admitting it is lookahead. That case is
    NOT_CAPTURED_AT_DECISION; a null or unknown admission clock is UNKNOWN, never a silent
    skip. See CELL_F_D5_CONTRACT_AMENDMENTS_2026-08-26.md A7."
  - "Do not spend a PR removing the bridge candidate cap: N_CANDIDATES=12 survives
    only as an OVERRIDDEN DEFAULT (prophet_bridge.py:146,1147) — production passes
    n=None (:4127; daily.yml:2270). A grep hitting the constant does not contradict
    this; observed narrow boards come from the admission gate chain, not a cap."
  - "Do not widen Conditional Fusion PR-3B (outcome-blind LOFO + member census, its
    own fresh session) into availability/Radar/lifecycle/V4-UI work — V4-E1 consumes
    the ACCEPTED registry after PR-3D."
  - "Do not build a second cross-family ranker, second theme graph, second earnings
    store, second forward grader, second publication truth, or a rival identity
    stack (masterplan §6.4 reject list; canonical owners in
    research/prophet_v4/CONTRACT_AND_OWNER_MAP.md)."
  - "Do not flatten Radar expert identities (G0/C1-C5) into one entry_signal boolean;
    entry-detector fusion is Radar's reserved F1_FUSION slot."
  - "Do not synthesize the missed Aug-14 session from later knowledge — exact
    reconstruction from Aug-14-knowable data or an explicit unrecoverable receipt."
  - "Do not replay US 2026-08-14 again. DEC:FORCE-MAJEURE-SESSIONS-ARE-BACKFILLED-BY-DEFAULT
    authorized one PIT reconstruction; A1R #6320 executed it, and natural run 32786919396
    absorbed it. Reconstructed rows remain unmarked and this authority does not extend
    to data-defect windows or a second replay."

      build; heal #6006 squash 0de8b86 merged 2026-08-19T20:07:23Z; groundwork
      branch claude/p-mp1-shell at 3f43864e41ce, no PR). P-LAB-UI after the
      settled shell + API, per the day-2 directive §7.
      DAY-3 STATE (2026-08-20, Sol Day-3 directive): SEQUENCE CORRECTED — the
      frozen LAB-0 §6 order is P-LAB-API -> R-LAB-1 -> Radar live commissioning
      -> P-MP1-SHELL -> P-LAB-UI; the day-2 handoff's shell->UI->commissioning
      ordering is SUPERSEDED. Gate A (G-D) PASS: measured at blob 251b9351 (the
      post-#6006 publication 0b0c296f, byte-identical at tip) — frozen Reading A
      (available/(available+blocked_data), not_applicable:plan_closed excluded
      per producer law) = 237/237 = 100.0000%, blocked_data 0; gross-row Reading
      B = 237/262 = 90.46%; ALL plausible readings clear >=90%. BINDING READING
      ADJUDICATED = Reading A (uniquely reproduces MP-1's literal 225/225).
      Do NOT wait for another nightly to re-measure — measure the CURRENT
      artifact (the day-2 'tonight's nightly' wait is CLOSED). Gate B (Radar
      commissioning) BLOCKED-ON-OPERATOR: W4 was already armed 08-18 by a prior
      operator; 215 armed passes ALL refused (160 in-window 'no_pack') — the
      08-19 pack builder store-gate red self-resolved, but four config blockers
      remain: B2 writer has NO spool destination (live env lacks R2 creds AND
      spool dir), B3 same-host split-brain (API env reads R2
      mastermindx/live_flow/entry_radar_events; writer resolves to nothing),
      B4 PROPHET_LAB_OBSERVATION_BASELINE_PATH absent from the API env, B5
      ENTRY_RADAR_SLICE_DIR unset (path /opt/terminal/terminal/public/data now
      VERIFIED live: 5.7G, 44,436 entries). Repairs are STAGED (systemd drop-in
      referencing the API env file — no credential values handled — + two path
      appends); the harness permission boundary denies remote production config
      mutation from any lane, so applying them is an OPERATOR act; receipts:
      /var/lib/macro-live/state/prophet_lab/commissioning_receipt_2026-08-20.json.
      Baseline NOT minted (CLI correctly refused: zero spooled passes — never
      self-baseline). P-MP1-SHELL: bounded prep MERGED #6049 (1ccf7fe8bdba —
      §8a stance projection plumbing unwired, pv_card parameter byte-parity
      proven, count plumbing, suites wired into engine-render-guards); CENTRAL
      ACT OWED on a Sol referral — MP-1 is silent on the W-L1 collision (the
      pinned provisional-board surface repaints the same #us-standouts .nbgrid
      the packet re-sources; research/WL1_PROVISIONAL_BOARD_DESIGN_SPEC.md).
      DS-PR #6055 MERGED (d78121d6459c: .skel + .mx-error ported from the

      gap. Heal #6053 MERGED (zh-rebind test re-pinned to the C8-C structural
      flip — the test-pinned-retired-literal trap, third instance). The five
      test_hk_board_ui reds were NOT fixture drift — #6029 proved a sparse-CI

      build rounds + THREE independent adversarial review rounds (final
      certification MERGE-SAFE; §8b three-part record: mechanism PASS /

      CRITICAL ESCALATION B1 (routed to Sol + operator,
      DSC:PROPHET-INDEX-PUBLIC-R2-TWIN): the FULL plan book is anonymously
      world-readable at the public R2 dev URL (200/2.16MB/262 plans with
      entries/zones/targets/invalidations/theses) while the origin 401s the
      same path — a LIVE pre-existing leak that the shell's paid boundary now
      sits on top of. Remedy sketch in the DSC (redacted public stub for the
      rescue watchdog + credentialed server-side reads for the Terminal's
      /api/flow route + delete the public object; all consumers are
      server-side). Post-merge render pending at the merge SHA; browser matrix
      + live verification follow the bake. Follow-ups owed: cadence finding
      for the Radar owner (cold-start pass exceeds the 5-min tick), N1 dead-JS
      heal, N2 macro.html dead CSS, remote-route proof (site-full token).

      DAY-5 STATE (2026-08-21, Sol Day-5 directive — B1 CLOSURE): Day-4

      reset, clean or reconstruct that checkout. Its detached dirty pin at
      a5f79c83 is the deliberate ENGINE the merged #6363 publisher lanes consume

## Context

Chairman-commissioned P0 (2026-08-17): Sol's masterplan
(`research/prophet_v4/PROPHET_US_V4_RECOVERY_AND_INTELLIGENCE_GRAPH_OS_MASTERPLAN_BY_SOL_2026-08-17.md`)
freezes the V4 thesis — surface by emergence, gate by the trade available now, rank by
intelligence, explain the evidence, let the Chairman decide. This workstream is the
INTEGRATION umbrella: it owns candidate-episode intake, board lifecycle, deterministic
entry availability, product projection, and operator workflow. It consumes — and never
duplicates — the sibling owners: Radar (expert events), Stock Identity (identity
epochs/routing), GMI (theme graph/state), EIOS (earnings), Conditional Fusion
(cross-family ranking machinery), Availability (rescue plane), Evaluation OS/QLedger
(outcome labels).

## Scope boundary

Wave definitions and acceptance live in masterplan §21; dependencies, merge order, and
path ownership in `research/prophet_v4/WAVE_GRAPH_AND_MERGE_ORDER.md` (its §4 rulings
govern every path shared with a registered sibling owner — engine/prophet_*.py belongs
to WS:PROPHET-US-ENTRY-TIMING and B2/B3/B4 execute jointly under it); nine numbered
architecture decisions in `research/prophet_v4/ARCHITECTURE_FREEZE.md` with the tenth
(wave dependencies/file ownership) frozen in the wave-graph doc. As each wave starts,
its owned paths are PROMOTED into this record's owns_paths (or the partner
workstream's) so the AgentOS collision detector can see them. Sibling wave
IDs (Radar W0-W9, Fusion PR-3x, GMI W3x, EIOS E0-E2) are never renamed by this program.
Future stores (candidate episode registry, availability artifacts, V4 rank projection)
enter `owns_paths:` when their waves create them — not before.
