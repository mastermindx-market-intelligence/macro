title: Macro context index (CXI) — governed project-context retrieval
objective: >
  Retrieve governed project context from Macro and the two sibling repositories with cited
  packets. Done = benchmark gates green, so the index can move from advisory to relied-upon.

      Superseded in structure by the Sol C0->C8 completion program
      (research/MACRO_CONTEXT_INDEX_COMPLETION_MASTERPLAN_BY_SOL.md); gate-green

      CORRECTED 2026-08-28 (was a stale todo): the agentos/** corpus already
      landed via Agent OS Phase 3 / PR #5561 (Sol capability ledger:
      BUILT_NOT_PROVEN). Integration PROOF is wave C4 of the completion program.

    next_action: >
      Sol adversarial review of the C0 recovery head (PR #6600 held
      HOLD-FOR-SOL). Evidence: agentos/handoffs/WS-MACRO-CONTEXT-INDEX-2026-08-28.md;
      baselines v6/v7 in research/context_index/BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md. After
      terminal C0 acceptance, C1 requires a fresh child operation, carrier, and
      commission; it may not reuse this C0 pickup.
landmines:
  - "Advisory status is load-bearing: cited sources must be opened before acting on them, per CXI-R19."
  - "Retrieval ranking frozen under the C0 carrier; C1 requires fresh post-acceptance operation/carrier/commission."
next_action: Await Sol review of C0 recovery; after terminal C0 acceptance, commission C1 separately for deterministic relevance + abstention on frozen v1.6 gold.

## Context

The context compiler the Agent OS builds on already exists here and already emits a cited
`context_packet.v1` with an adjudication mode. Agent OS Phase 3 extends it with the
`agentos/**` corpus rather than building a second retrieval system.
