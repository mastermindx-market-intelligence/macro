key: RATES-INFLATION-COMMAND
title: Rates & Inflation Command plus Macro Release Intelligence completion
objective: >
  Deliver one correction-safe, evidence-calibrated premium Rates & Inflation workflow spanning
  releases, rates/curve momentum, dealer/OPEX context, canonical transmission, policy/Fed path,
  Forward Path synthesis and learning. Done means real current inputs traverse production into the
  actual user/machine consumers with all authority ceilings, nulls, evidence clocks and failure states
  intact; CI or merged infrastructure alone is not completion.

      01a04bde-8ce8-7903-ae91-6c38c63ac4cf received a Sol CONTINUE, but no START or source
      effect followed. Do not mint another F1. The exact task must fresh-read current procedure,
      worktree, main and path collisions, then emit a separate truthful START or a typed blocker.

next_action: >
  Continue only the already-existing F1 operation on its original carrier: the exact native task
  must satisfy its fresh pre-START gates and then return a separate START or typed blocker; never
  submit a duplicate F1. Keep F2 held behind terminal release and merge of Options C0 #6604 /
  MAS-195 plus a fresh RIC path/authority census. Keep F3 READY but WAITING_CAPACITY /
  needs_placement under MAS-245 until the accepted placement owner supplies a concrete receiver.
  F4-F7 remain dependency-gated. Every later commission requires pickup ACK and separate START.

## Why this workstream exists

Rates & Inflation Command accumulated real implementation across multiple July/August programs, but
there was no durable Agent OS workstream tying current product intent, authority law, current gaps and
continuation together. The result was a stale W-number masterplan coexisting with newer canonical
release/transmission/options systems and disconnected implementation seams.

## Current frontier

F0 is records-only and accepted/merged; it created no product or runtime capability. F1 already has
one canonical operation and exact pre-START receiver task, but no START or source effect; continue only
that carrier after fresh gates. F2 is held behind the canonical Options C0 release/merge and a fresh
RIC collision census. F3 is ready but waiting for lawful capacity placement. F4-F7 remain
dependency-gated and are not commissioned merely because this record names them.

The complete capability ledger, exact first commission packets and production acceptance contract are
in `research/RATES_INFLATION_COMMAND_RECOVERY_AND_COMPLETION_FREEZE_2026-08-27.md`.
