key: RATES-INFLATION-COMMAND
title: Rates & Inflation Command plus Macro Release Intelligence completion
objective: >
  Deliver one correction-safe, evidence-calibrated premium Rates & Inflation workflow spanning
  releases, rates/curve momentum, dealer/OPEX context, canonical transmission, policy/Fed path,
  Forward Path synthesis and learning. Done means real current inputs traverse production into the
  actual user/machine consumers with all authority ceilings, nulls, evidence clocks and failure states
  intact; CI or merged infrastructure alone is not completion.

  Complete PR #6543 F0 independent review/merge, then submit the frozen RIC-F1, RIC-F2 and RIC-F3
  packets through canonical Executive admission/routing as three disjoint operations and call a lane
  active only after its concrete Fable/worker carrier/session ACK is proven.

## Why this workstream exists

Rates & Inflation Command accumulated real implementation across multiple July/August programs, but
there was no durable Agent OS workstream tying current product intent, authority law, current gaps and
continuation together. The result was a stale W-number masterplan coexisting with newer canonical
release/transmission/options systems and disconnected implementation seams.

## Current frontier

F0 is records-only and has no product/runtime effect. F1/F2/F3 are the first independently useful
capability lanes, but as of the recovery they are not runtime-claimed. F4-F7 remain CEO-owned
integration waves and may not be treated as commissioned merely because this record names them.

The complete capability ledger, exact first commission packets and production acceptance contract are
in `research/RATES_INFLATION_COMMAND_RECOVERY_AND_COMPLETION_FREEZE_2026-08-27.md`.
