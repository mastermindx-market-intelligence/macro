key: TECHNICAL-OPPORTUNITY-INTELLIGENCE
title: Technical Opportunity Intelligence — multi-timeframe setup, trigger, path, and remaining-opportunity system
objective: >
  Build one causal technical perception layer for U.S. equities that surfaces both
  Forming/Armed opportunities before a move and Triggered/Confirmed opportunities after
  evidence arrives, with explicit trigger, invalidation, confirmation cost, chase,
  contradiction, and remaining-opportunity semantics. Done for the first vertical when
  Compression Release is proven on completed Weekly/Daily/4H inputs, produces real
  two-queue occurrences in production, renders in the product and Terminal, accrues
  prospective evidence, and receives a Sol species-by-species authority ruling.

      DONE — PR #6570 merged 2026-08-30 as
      6e3126c5106d5d240961088a866bf0e45f940538. W0 is durable records-only
      `SPEC_ONLY`; it created no research result, runtime, data panel, signal, product or
      production authority.

landmines:
  - "Live Entry Radar owns tactical 5-minute entry events; this program must not create another radar, WebSocket plane, entry-event store, or tactical evaluator."
  - "Setup Species is the canonical scientific registry; a new technical-species registry is a duplicate control plane."
  - "The current confluence miner is a Combo-v1 benchmark, not the complete technical estate and not an entry-timing authority."
  - "The U.S. 390-minute regular session does not divide evenly into four-hour bars; research and Terminal clocks must be measured and versioned."
  - "Entitlement or a successful API call is not proof of historical point-in-time availability, corrections, rights, or universe coverage."
  - "Downside breakdown research starts with zero directional-short authority."
  - "Weekly/Daily/4H is the first proving slice, not the final horizon estate; future cold starts must preserve Monthly structural context, Radar-owned true intraday context, and point-in-time sector/theme/basket expansion."
  - "A branch, PR, queue, transport delivery, or worker ACK is not evidence of live execution; W1 and W2-0 use one carrier each, typed returns, and reciprocal continuation watching under the current procedure amendment."
  - "WS:TEMPORAL-GRAIN-INTELLIGENCE is a sibling exact-chart G/A/K/D and filter-memory study; it neither completes nor replaces this program's W1 or W2-0."
do_not_redo:
  - "Do not build a universal technical score or average Forming/Armed with Triggered/Confirmed."
  - "Do not redo per-name in-sample outcome audition (DNR:KILL-OUTCOME-AUDITION)."
  - "Do not repackage killed PSS standalone timers or hard gates under new names."
  - "Do not merge the setup population into Prophet's graded board (DNR:KILL-PROPHET-POP-MERGE)."
  - "Do not let an LLM originate a signal, rank, gate, size, numeric confidence, or trade."
  - "Do not begin Compression Release outcome testing until W1 and W2-0 are both accepted."
  - "Do not treat Temporal Grain chart parity or artifact diagnostics as the TOI data-plane admission gate."

next_action: >
  W0 is merged. W1 Evidence Census and W2-0 Data/Clock Archaeology may now be
  independently placed on separate disjoint carriers under operation keys
  TOI-W1-EVIDENCE-CENSUS-V1 and TOI-W2-0-DATA-CLOCK-V1 after current collision checks.
  Both must return and be accepted before W3 preregistration or outcome testing. Neither
  operation has a Slack delivery, pickup, START or runtime effect in this reconciliation.

## Boundary note

This workstream is the broad technical-perception program under
`market-timing-intelligence`. It does not subsume `WS:LIVE-ENTRY-RADAR`,
`WS:STOCK-IDENTITY`, `WS:PROPHET-US-ENTRY-TIMING`, or
`WS:TEMPORAL-GRAIN-INTELLIGENCE`; it consumes or hands off through their declared
boundaries.

`WS:TEMPORAL-GRAIN-INTELLIGENCE` owns exact motivating-chart identity/parity,
bar-grain versus anchor versus filter-memory versus data-plane causal separation, and a
possible later structure-to-kernel law. This workstream's W2-0 retains broad
U.S.-equity data/clock/correction/coverage/rights and Terminal-parity admission. One
cannot be used to mark the other complete.

## Horizon end-state

Weekly/Daily/4H is the first proving vertical, not a permanent ceiling. The complete
program must later incorporate Monthly structural/regime context, true intraday
context through Live Entry Radar's existing event and market-data owners, and
point-in-time sector, industry, theme, and basket opportunity objects. Those later
horizons reuse the same species and occurrence law; they do not authorize a second
intraday plane or a wider first PR.
