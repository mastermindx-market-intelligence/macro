title: Filing Forensics — source-preserving SEC evidence workbench
objective: >
  Keep Filing Forensics honest about source clocks (FF-0, closed live) and give
  Mastermind a production-grade incremental broad SEC source plane (FF-1) so
  later waves can see which issuers have new SEC information without a rerender
  minting freshness. FF-2 must not start until FF-1 is production-proven live.

      PARTIAL / IN_PROGRESS. FF-1P2R current-quarter discovery remains
      PROVEN_LIVE. Scheduled run 33247138975 on 2026-08-29/30 then proved the
      bounded partial/replay path against a larger 2,842-issuer live universe:
      aggregate Company Facts exhaustion drained on the same workflow carrier
      from backlog 42 -> 32 -> 20 -> 8 -> 0 without changing source law or the
      frozen 32 MiB per-run cap. Final attempt-5 job 99190103903 /
      run_0e66732e4f506b25446a was complete with expected/observed 2,842/2,842,
      failed=0, companyfacts_deferred=0, failures=[] and latest-complete
      advanced; latest relevant SEC accepted_at was 2026-08-28T20:28:19.000Z.
      FF-1 is still not globally correction-safe: July FF-1R remains unexecuted
      after the #6391 source-law landing and previous-quarter weekly
      reconciliation remains SPEC_ONLY / NOT_BUILT. FF-2 stays locked.

      PROVEN_LIVE. PR #5898 merged as
      21f51a1ecfed778a738b048bd7e5efd30b1d9336. Production Run A
      32604043860 / run_4e7970fb7cb841b6671d established the canonical
      current-quarter baseline for 2,841 parquet-derived issuers. Run B
      32605564919 / run_8583eb7ce7476290c0b2 proved the quiet incremental
      path: baseline=false, one index acquisition, 2,627 unchanged relevant
      rows, zero affected issuers, zero Submissions or Company Facts fanout,
      canonical=true, issuer/ticker/CIK=2,841/2,841/2,841,
      expected/observed/failed=2,841/2,841/0, failures=[], and complete
      publication. The later scheduled run 33247138975 exercised the intended bounded
      partial-replay law on 2,842 issuers: attempts 1-4 persisted lawful issuer
      evidence while refusing latest-complete, and attempt 5 / job 99190103903 /
      run_0e66732e4f506b25446a completed 2,842/2,842 with zero failures,
      zero deferred Company Facts and backlog zero. This proves current-quarter
      discovery/replay only; it does not close historical or previous-quarter
      correction coverage.

  - "Source freshness SLA is 4 days (daily pipeline + weekend + one missed night). Do not reuse PUBLIC_SUMMARY_MAX_AGE_DAYS (30) as a freshness claim."
  - "GET /api/forensics/health must stay a clocks/status document. Putting assert_no_private_leak in the request path would 500 a paid route; leak checks belong in tests."
  - "Desktop evidence used to early-return in openEvidence(); the CTA only focused a finding. The analysis drawer (is-open + data-analysis-open + scrim) is the FF-0 visible transition."
  - "Session worktrees are sparse by default. Never write into omitted data/ — that truncates the committed artifact."
  - "FF-1 object identity is SHA-256 of exact SEC bytes. Poll clocks must not enter that identity. Company Facts is a current observed snapshot, never as-of poll_started_at."
  - "recorded_at must not default to poll_started_at. Submissions and Company Facts each carry their own retrieved_at stamped after exact bytes. poll_completed_at is sampled only after issuer attempts conclude."
  - "An empty FF-1 index snapshot makes incremental a discovery baseline: persist the current-quarter relevant set, emit a complete census, and fetch zero per-issuer Submissions or Company Facts. Do not treat quarter-to-date index rows as new events on that first run."
  - "Partial polls may persist successful issuer evidence but must not advance latest-complete. Scheduled lane exits non-zero on partial. latest-complete is a compact pointer and commits last."
  - "Aggregate Company Facts run-budget exhaustion is resumable partial-poll behavior, not authority to raise MAX_COMPANYFACTS_BYTES_PER_RUN. Reconcile each typed queue_overflow effect, retain already-committed issuer evidence, and continue only on the same logical workflow carrier until backlog zero or a different failure class appears."
  - "FF-1 shares concurrency group filing-forensics-sec with Wave-2. Do not give it a second group."
  - "Live data/edgar/fundamentals.parquet can exceed an outdated MAX_UNIVERSE_ISSUERS. Measure unique issuer count against the cap before dispatching recovery. Do not shrink the parquet to fit the cap."
  - "Broad FF-1 discovery is the official EDGAR full-index master ZIP. Do not fan a per-issuer data.sec.gov census over the canonical parquet population. Do not download submissions.zip nightly. The actual universe is parquet-derived per run and the 4,000 bind cap remains fail-closed. Wave-2 stays per-issuer/realtime. Never purge fundamental_forensics/broad-sec/v1/."
  - "A cancelled 90-minute run may have admitted valid immutable objects with no latest-complete. Index baseline may become canonical while those objects remain. Reconcile issuer latest pointers only when an issuer is affected; do not infer emptiness from list_prefix."

  - "Index state is quarter-scoped. Do not treat Q3 rows missing from a Q4 baseline as mass corrections."

  - "FF-1R freezes one recovery plan from the sha-verified latest-complete anchor and its EDGAR snapshot. A later current-quarter poll or mutable index must not change that plan. Every recovery tranche is at most 64 selected CIKs; historical Submissions shards are date-span-selected, bounded, and never an all-shard crawl."
  - "A partial FF-1R tranche may write immutable observations, receipts and its compact continuation, but never latest-complete. Only a backlog-zero final composition may advance latest-complete, and it must preserve newer current-incremental evidence."
  - "POINTER_MAX_BYTES=16 KiB governs compact mutable heads and pointers only. Full immutable issuer manifests use their separately measured 128 KiB finite envelope in both recovery and incremental paths (DSC:FF-1-IMMUTABLE-MANIFEST-IS-NOT-A-COMPACT-POINTER)."
  - "FF-1R run 32626273461 / run_382b4fbf26bb0fe3e298 is a fail-closed transport witness, not tranche progress: ANGO was refused at 20,779 > 16,384 before cursor movement. Do not label its retry tranche B."
  - "Corrective tranche-A run 32708350406 / run_56830b4a74bd82a33d19 proved the immutable-manifest transport repair, then failed closed before progress because ANGO accession 0001628280-26-048138 conflicted on acceptance_datetime. That production failure remains immutable evidence; #6391 later changed only the duplicate-comparison law for valid same-instant representations and did not move recovery state."

## Context

FF-0 is closed live (operator-signed production smoke, all five checks PASS,
PR #5794). FF-1 is the incremental broad SEC source plane. Discovery is the
official EDGAR full-index master ZIP; per-CIK Submissions and selective
Company Facts run only for affected canonical issuers
(`DEC:FF-1-BROAD-DISCOVERY-USES-EDGAR-INDEXES`).

PR #5820 merged (`cd064848298063faac82059f71daf24bdd4112a2`). PR #5864
merged the 4000 bind-cap repair (`4f59f720a0a1459a11a7bd131e41833c38cbe0d4`).
The first scheduled incremental (run 32097495749) failed `universe_invalid`.
The first incremental after the cap raise (run 32116597760) cancelled at the
90-minute job timeout on the former per-issuer census and emitted no receipt.
The submissions.zip canary declared 1.45 GiB and was correctly stopped. P2R
replaced current-quarter discovery with the EDGAR master-index kernel; the old
census architecture remains retired.

#5898 merged as `21f51a1ecfed778a738b048bd7e5efd30b1d9336` and owns
current-quarter index-driven discovery only
(`DEC:FF-1-RECOVERY-NOT-COMMISSIONED`). Run A `32604043860` established the
2,841-name canonical baseline; Run B `32605564919` proved the quiet
incremental path without issuer fanout. Before this successor, `mode=recovery`
failed closed with `recovery_plan_required` before any SEC call or Research R2
write. PR #6285 merged as `1e7d9f5030fd7c7c06fb03f022857510c5d0f9ed`
and commissioned the bounded July recovery engine. Production run
`32626273461` / `run_382b4fbf26bb0fe3e298` selected 64 CIKs but failed
closed on its first issuer, ANGO, because a valid 20,779-byte immutable
manifest was read through the 16 KiB compact-pointer envelope. It made one
current-Submissions request, zero Company Facts requests, and no recovery
progress. Recovery froze at plan
`e252f0a85c193323be128b6de2762c522a0ab86b74d8a2ed15a1f3014695e5a4`,
cursor 0, completed total 0 and null last-successful recovery receipt.

PR #6318 merged the separately bounded immutable-manifest transport repair as
`32cbd775e827653e88f8be6f8094d73e8c3014dc`. The next scheduled incremental,
run `32688874242` / `run_2dfb3cc973b3f025b09e`, lawfully advanced
latest-complete without changing the frozen recovery plan or continuation.
Sol-released corrective tranche-A run `32708350406` /
`run_56830b4a74bd82a33d19` selected the same cursor-zero 64-CIK slice and read
the valid 20,779-byte legacy ANGO manifest without the former transport error.
It then failed closed on ANGO accession `0001628280-26-048138` because duplicate
evidence conflicted on `acceptance_datetime`: failures=1, current Submissions=1,
historical Submissions=0, Company Facts=0, completed=0 and backlog=2,571.
latest-complete, ANGO and the recovery continuation remained byte-identical;
only the immutable failed receipt/observations and latest-observation head were
published. That run remains a negative production witness, not a recovery
checkpoint.

Sol subsequently adjudicated the conflict as representational, not substantive:
`2026-07-14T19:42:40Z` and `2026-07-14T19:42:40.000Z` are equal instants under
the existing frozen `_iso_order_key`, while exact SEC text stays immutable.
PR #6391 landed the bounded comparator repair as
`a8075391fa895ec706976cd9cb9238c7e4cbdaea`; it did not move the July recovery
plan, cursor or continuation. No historical recovery workflow has been
dispatched after that landing.

The scheduled 2026-08-29 broad-SEC incremental run `33247138975` then found 57
new relevant Q3 accessions across 53 affected issuers in the now 2,842-issuer
canonical universe. Its first four attempts intentionally failed closed only at
the 32 MiB aggregate Company Facts run budget, with immutable committed issuer
evidence preserved and latest-complete held: receipts
`run_f14d89994239f7cd7583` (backlog 42), `run_c6059aa15979d46bc4e7`
(backlog 32), `run_3923c15f657b40a64afa` (backlog 20), and
`run_13bf80ca9b8550495053` (backlog 8). Sol reconciled each known effect before
continuing the same workflow carrier and never raised a cap or changed source
law. Attempt 5 / job `99190103903` / `run_0e66732e4f506b25446a` completed with
expected/observed=2,842/2,842, failed=0, companyfacts_deferred=0, backlog=0,
failures=[] and latest-complete advanced; latest relevant SEC accepted_at is
`2026-08-28T20:28:19.000Z`. Current-quarter discovery is therefore healthy and
production-proven again. Historical July recovery and previous-quarter weekly
reconciliation remain the outstanding FF-1 truth gaps; do not mark FF-1 done or
start FF-2.
