title: Grey Deer Risk Intelligence & Capital Protection System
objective: >
  Separate slow measured market state, transition hazard and capital policy;
  publish one canonical risk envelope across Macro, Prophet, Terminal and
  Mastermind Portfolio; and allow only individually promoted or explicitly
  temporary, scope-bounded, counterfactual-preserving protection rules to affect
  actionability. Done means a real market event reaches real production users and
  authorized machine consumers with PIT clocks, correction receipts and learning.

  - "Collision fence (Sol ruling 2026-08-19): #5925 entry_radar live_pack MERGED but its PRODUCTION PROOF is still outstanding — no Grey Deer edits to engine/entry_radar/** until the Radar owner accepts the proof. Fences for #5928/#5929/#5954/#5948 are RESOLVED (all merged) and removed."
  - "The CI control-plane program's operator grant does NOT extend to Grey Deer: never admin-merge a Grey Deer PR over red main on that precedent."
  - "site/riskdata/ sits under market-regime-risk's implementation roots in config/mastermind_programs.yml — Grey Deer owns only risk_envelope.json inside it; raw regime/market-state artifacts stay with market-regime-risk."
  - "Session worktrees are sparse: site/ and data/ writes require scripts/worktree_sparse.py opt-in before any GD-2+ build touches them."
do_not_redo:
  - "No universal fused risk score in scored/authority paths (see DEC:RISK-STATE-HAZARD-POLICY-SEPARATION; legacy engine/risk_state.py is frozen compatibility, not a template)."
  - "No new event store / forward ledger for risk episodes — Chronicle + Reflex Registry + QLedger own durable history (DEC:RISK-EPISODES-USE-CHRONICLE-AND-REFLEXES)."
  - "No Prophet rank/population mutation, ever — actionability sidecar only (DEC:PROPHET-RANK-PRESERVED-MARKET-ELIGIBILITY-SIDECAR)."
  - "No arming Portfolio brain/posture_decider.py as a shortcut; no LLM probability_rolldown in any authoritative consumer."

    # HISTORICAL PRE-ACCEPTANCE STATE: WAITING_FOR_PRODUCTION_EVENT (Sol fallback,

    # AUTHENTICATED browser witness (regwall = Supabase session cookie only,
    # no ops bypass — verified app/regwall.py). The operator's Chrome never
    # connected during the full 2026-08-21 11:00-22:00Z window (14 retries);
    # a 2026-08-22 retry DID connect and sign in, but 2026-08-22 was a
    # SATURDAY, so no US session and no lawful event existed.
    # CORRECTION (2026-08-27): the 2026-08-21 record's claim that "no VPS
    # shell exists from the fleet host" is FALSE. app/deploy/README.md:29
    # documents `ssh -i ~/.ssh/macro_dashboard_deploy_v2 root@146.190.142.17`

    # PRE-VERIFIED IN PRODUCTION 2026-08-27 over that shell: the box runs the
    # GD-3R1 bytes; risk_envelope_live executes ok on EVERY fast-lane fire
    # (~0.9-2.2s, risk_state on odd minutes) — closing the 2026-08-21
    # unverified item; and the served 2026-08-26T22:59Z envelope proves the
    # closed-market clock laws in real bytes (event_time null while built was
    # 22:59:46; observed_at 22:59:46.623Z vs produced_at 22:59:47.538Z, ms
    # precision, 915ms apart; clocks.upstream_built 22:57:42.000Z separate;
    # revision live_provisional; all four authority booleans false).

# Grey Deer Risk Intelligence & Capital Protection

The canonical architecture, laws, wave packets, acceptance matrices, collision
fences and research protocol live in `research/grey_deer/` (see its `README.md`
for precedence). This record carries program state only.

**Authority summary:** the Risk Envelope owns no rank/size/gate/execute
authority. Policy authority arrives only per-rule via the frozen promotion
gates (freeze §10) or an explicit `temporary_operator_safety` Chairman grant
(freeze §11). Automatic held-position exit is out of scope for v1.

**Ownership summary:** Macro owns market truth, hazard experts, the envelope
and Prophet eligibility sidecars; Prophet owns raw rank/admission; Terminal
mirrors; Mastermind Portfolio consumes the envelope and owns book-specific
sizing/settlement/execution; LLMs explain and de-escalate only.
