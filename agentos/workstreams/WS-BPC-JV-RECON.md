title: BioPharmCatalyst JV snapshot reconstruction (independent primary sources)
objective: >
  Turn the authorized 2026-08-17 BPC snapshots into a reconstruction spec, then
  later onboard the licensed corpus and independently rebuild reconstructable
  families from Mastermind-owned primary sources. RECON-0 is done: freeze
  architecture accepted by Sol and PR #5909 merged 2026-08-19T19:51:49Z as
  9711c60d3067f1908a7822008ffd7a8b23171854.
  Done for the program = (1) licensed snapshot corpus onboarded and useful,
  (2) independent producers can continuously regenerate the targeted data
  families, (3) owner-plane projections wired to website/machine consumers,
  (4) research can use the data under PIT rules. RECON-1 hermetic Drugs@FDA ZIP
  replay is not program completion.

      Done. #5909 merged 2026-08-19T19:51:49Z as 9711c60d3067. Do not start

      #5909 is merged; commissioning is now owed to Sol (bundled with the

      commissioned and W1–W4 bytes are in the implementation environment, census
      each workbook (SHA-256 → ordered sheet set → dimensions → content hashes →
      pair class ADDITIVE_SHEET_EXPORT_IDENTICAL_COMMON_CONTENT |

    biopharmcatalyst_benchmark is historical clean-room policy; never silently

    rights, not a continuous BPC feed.

    Export-time Price/IV/OI/EM/mcap must never join onto historical event rows
    as pre-event features. They may be used as capture-time observations from
    their actual capture timestamp onward.

    production_ingest_allowed is the continuous-producer gate. Do not flip it
    true to "allow snapshot import."

    The active launch SLO manifest is soak_scheduled and hash-binds
    predecessor config/biocatalyst_sources.yml. Do not insert
    biopharmcatalyst_jv_snapshot into that live registry, re-hash the

    Relationship is UNRESOLVED_PENDING_SNAPSHOT_ONBOARD_CENSUS. The open

    Do not mutate the soak-bound predecessor source registry or add
    machine-enforced JV source-registry tests during the active soak. Runtime
    registration waits for the post-soak successor registry / successor

## Context

RECON-0 is Sol-accepted architecture, merged 2026-08-19 (PR #5909, squash
`9711c60d3067f1908a7822008ffd7a8b23171854`).
Canonical identity `biopharmcatalyst_jv_snapshot` is frozen; live registry
insertion is deferred until the post-soak successor source-registry /
successor launch-manifest transition. The program continues (`status: active`).
SNAPSHOT-ONBOARD and CONTINUOUS-RECON remain todo. The matcher-only RECON-1
wave stays dropped. Do not start SNAPSHOT-ONBOARD, CONTINUOUS-RECON,
Drugs@FDA work, device/CDRH, PDUFA work, or any runtime implementation from
this PR. After merge, return to Sol to commission the first bounded
SNAPSHOT-ONBOARD vertical.
