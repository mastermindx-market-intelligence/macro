title: Live Entry Radar — real-time tactical entry discovery/ranking for U.S. equities
objective: >
  Build a new, separate real-time U.S. tactical entry system (washout→turn detection inside
  structurally strong names, ranked by forward asymmetry) as a champion/challenger research
  product with a forward ledger. Prophet's selection/gating stays byte-identical. Done =
  entry_radar.html live on the VPS plane with the G0/C1..C5 arena accruing evidence under the
  frozen PR-0 contract, and every promotion claim gated by Evaluation OS law.

    # commissioning_receipt_2026-08-20.json (VPS). FOUND: W4 was ALREADY armed
    # 2026-08-18 13:04 by a prior operator (env header "W6 commissioning") and
    # ran 215 armed passes through 08-19 — 160 IN-WINDOW, every one refused
    # 'no_pack' (the pack service exited 5 on the 08-19 windows: the daily
    # store's newest session had not advanced — an HONEST refusal that
    # self-resolved; 08-20 dry-run builds names=241 with inversion proof
    # 725/725 pass). ARMED IS NOT PRODUCING: zero envelopes have EVER been
    # written to the canonical spool (R2 mastermindx/live_flow/
    # entry_radar_events = 0 keys; the sibling nominations prefix holds 195
    # keys written by the marketing hot-tape workflow, proving transport).
    # Four config blockers, all staged for repair, application = OPERATOR act
    # (the session harness denies remote production config mutation): B2 the
    # writer env (/etc/macro-live.env) has neither R2 credentials nor a spool
    # dir — spool_then_commit withholds every transition fail-closed with no
    # error surface; B3 same-host split-brain — the API env reads the R2
    # events prefix the writer never writes; B4 the API env lacks
    # PROPHET_LAB_OBSERVATION_BASELINE_PATH; B5 ENTRY_RADAR_SLICE_DIR unset
    # (G0/C5 publish slice_store_unconfigured; the LAB-0 candidate path
    # /opt/terminal/terminal/public/data is NOW VERIFIED live: 5.7G, 44,436
    # entries, manifest.json, fresh mtime). Staged repair = a systemd drop-in
    # giving the evaluator unit EnvironmentFile=/etc/macro-api.env (no
    # credential VALUES handled anywhere; same-source by construction; 0 env
    # name collisions, only the four R2_* names referenced by spool.py) + the
    # two path appends + macro-api restart. Baseline NOT minted — the CLI
    # refused on zero spooled passes, verbatim refusal preserved (correct:
    # never self-baseline). Known residual risks for the applier: the pack
    # service caps MemoryMax=512M vs ~857MB observed unconstrained build RSS
    # (watch the next 10:20:35Z run's exit); the remote-route same-source
    # proof needs a site-full operator bearer token (none exists on the host;
    # none was minted); an in-window pass with an EMPTY delta spools nothing,
    # so first-envelope timing depends on real transitions after 13:29Z.
    # DAY-4 (2026-08-20): COMMISSIONED. Repairs applied by the Fable session
    # under explicit Chairman admin grant (drop-in EnvironmentFile=
    # /etc/macro-api.env on the evaluator unit; ENTRY_RADAR_SLICE_DIR;
    # PROPHET_LAB_OBSERVATION_BASELINE_PATH + macro-api restart). NEW code
    # blocker found by the first real in-window pass and healed same-day
    # (#6095: live_eval._quote_ts read only 'ts' but the local-quote loader
    # normalizes rows to 'ts_ms' via live_verify._merge_quotes — a fresh,
    # correct 2,089-symbol quotes_full.json darked the ENTIRE probe set
    # 0/2979; e2e regression now runs the real loader chain). Two bounded
    # resource rulings on macro-live-entry-radar.service (drop-ins:
    # MemoryHigh=768M/MemoryMax=1G after a 256M-throttle swap-crawl kill;
    # TimeoutStartSec=570 after a cold-I/O ~10min first pass — 60-150s CPU,
    # rest I/O over the 5.7G slice tree). First genuine envelope
    # live_flow/entry_radar_events/2026-08-20/115834-entry_radar_live.json
    # (supervised manual pass, timer stopped/restarted around it: 240/2979
    # usable quotes, 54 transitions, 27 events, 237 basis audits 0 mismatch).
    # Baseline minted lawfully 16:10:41Z (dry-run first, backend r2).
    # Post-mint SERVICE cycles self-sustain at ~5min (warm ledger = delta
    # passes fit the window): live_forward=49 / retrospective_seed=150,
    # pools separate, coverage_verified true. OWNER FOLLOW-UP (cadence): any
    # long gap re-creates the cold-start wedge — a first pass after a dark
    # period exceeds the 5-min tick + 570s timeout; consider substrate
    # caching or a bootstrap path. SOL RULING (Day-5, 2026-08-21): accepted
    # as a Radar-owner follow-up, NOT a Prophet Lab defect. Target
    # capability: after a genuine dark gap the Radar autonomously reaches
    # its first valid envelope without timeout/overlap failure while
    # retaining the healthy 5-min warm cadence. Do NOT solve by arbitrary
    # timeout/memory inflation — measure the cold-start phases, establish
    # the actual bottleneck, then commission a bounded Radar-owner wave if
    # needed. Proceeds independently; blocks neither B1 nor P-LAB-UI.
    # SECURITY ESCALATION (Day-5, DSC:RADAR-SPOOL-PUBLIC-R2): the canonical
    # spool prefix live_flow/entry_radar_events/ is ANONYMOUSLY READABLE on
    # the public R2 dev host with guessable dated keys (verified 200,
    # 2026-08-21). Radar-owner + delivery-plane-program item; deliberately
    # untouched by the B1 wave. Pack-unit MemoryMax remains untested for
    # a full in-service build. Per the LAB-0 non-completion rule this
    # commissioning contributes evidence toward B6 but does NOT close it
    # (full-RTH-session cadence proof still owed).
    # Commissioned 2026-08-18 by the Chairman's Prophet Operator Lab program (V4-B5A,
    # DEC:PROPHET-LAB-B5A-RECUT; contract research/prophet_v4/
    # LAB0_B5_RECUT_OPERATOR_LAB_2026-08-18.md §6.2A). Executes under THIS
    # workstream's ownership (Radar owns detector truth; the Lab is a read-only
    # projection). Scope, receipts pinned at main a7cfd4bef589: (1) live_eval
    # _nightly_lanes() reads (pack.probe_set or {}).get("nightly_lanes")
    # (live_eval.py:2090-2104) but probe_set_snapshot() emits only
    # {source, market_session, count, tickers, admission} (live_pack.py:686-731) —
    # confirmed lanes are therefore ALWAYS "unavailable"; prefer
    # entry_radar.live_pack/v2 with explicit confirmed_lanes inside
    # compute_pack_hash() coverage (live_pack.py:659-680 currently excludes
    # probe_set). (2) W4 spools the entry_radar.events/v1 pass envelope
    # (build_event_payload, live_ledger.py:1114-1132) but W5 read_spool_events()
    # gates on top-level mastermind.entry_event.v1 (reconcile_entry_radar.py:95,
    # 268-271) — every W4 pass object is rejected as off-schema; W5 must consume
    # the real envelope and derive first-observation time from envelope pass_ts.
    # (3) Preserve exact G0 events EntryEventStore.events() → PendingDelta.events →
    # spool-before-consume; add an end-to-end contract test
    # build_event_payload() → read_spool_events(). (4) W5 stays sole durable
    # data/entry_radar writer; NO detector spec hash changes; Prophet protected
    # paths byte-clean; never mutate the immutable mastermind.entry_event.v1 event.
    # Baseline discipline: #5897 MERGED 2026-08-19 (bc7bf982a45a) mid-build —
    # this wave's branch rebased onto its post-merge main; the W4 test baseline

    # Build-worker receipts (in progress, not yet merged): SCHEMA_LIVE_PACK
    # bumped v1->v2 with confirmed_lanes covered by compute_pack_hash();
    # live_eval._nightly_lanes() reads pack.confirmed_lanes;
    # entry_radar_live_pack.py's slice_lanes() read moved before build_pack()
    # so the pack can carry it; reconcile_entry_radar.read_spool_events()
    # accepts the real entry_radar.events/v1 envelope (unwraps events[],
    # validates each via EntryEvent.from_dict, derives observed_at from the

## Context

Operator/CEO execution handoff (2026-08-13) commissioned a real-time entry discovery,
comparison and ranking engine — archetype: structural strength → temporary weakness → selling
exhaustion → observable turn → renewed demand — explicitly separate from Prophet conviction
and from the existing validated entry gauge. Same-day operator design directive: the new
Prophet Board is the direct design reference; Radar is a sister product in that exact
card/layout language with only the information architecture changed.

Governing document: `research/LIVE_ENTRY_RADAR_PR0_RESEARCH_CONTRACT.md` (frozen at PR-0
merge; §18 append-only amendments). Archaeology evidence: `research/live_entry_radar/TRACK_[A-E]_*.md`.
Champion G0 is the Terminal repo's early anticipation dot (`charting-app/signal_layer/confluence_v2.py`);
cross-repo parity is fixture-enforced, never copy-paste drift. Evaluation reuses the
Evaluation OS + the PSS §7 timing-ruler discipline; ranking ships as ACCRUING Research
Priority until house promotion gates clear.

Accepted child-wave graph (each modifying child = one fresh stable operation key,
one GitHub carrier, one exact Slack thread, terminal watcher boundary):

```text
LER-C0 records/program-control acceptance (carrier #6599; this reconciliation)
 -> LER-C1 W4.2 private evidence transport (spool non-anonymous; existing R2 owner)
 -> LER-C2 W4.3 dark-gap recovery + full natural RTH cadence + current coverage
 -> LER-C3 W5.2 prospective Eval OS reconnect (real event -> private spool ->
            forward.parquet -> qledger; existing sole reconciler only)
 -> LER-C4 W6.1 real non-empty Research Priority acceptance (Sol scientific gate)
 -> LER-C5 W8 reconciliation of existing #5737 only (independent when disjoint)
 -> LER-C6 W9 production entry_radar.html (real data; browser acceptance)
 -> LER-C7 W7 Opportunity science only when sample-ready (Sol scientific gate)
 -> LER-C8 integrated acceptance + read-only Stock Identity handoff
```

Wave mapping: C1/C2 close the W4.1 residues; C3 closes the W5 prospective gap;
C4 closes W6; C5 lands W8; C6 ships W9; C7 adjudicates W7; C8 closes the
program under the masterplan §11 completion law (Truth / Intelligence / Product /
Learning). Radar records expert events; `WS:STOCK-IDENTITY` (active carrier
#6529, not editable from Radar children) remains the sole per-security
expert-routing owner, consuming a read-only event boundary.
