  standalone anticipation and risk intelligence lobe with bounded Prophet confluence.
  Done = ranked, falsifiable, receipt-backed EOD signals with explicit no-signal/degraded
  states, production-proven per slice (AD-0…AD-15 per the committed recovery masterplan).

landmines:
  - >-
    The ThetaData Terminal license allows ONE terminal instance
    (com.macro.theta-terminal on the M1 host). Never launch a second Terminal,
    never copy the ~60GB T1 store between runners, and never mint a second
    store path — engine/thetadata_store.resolve_thetadata_store() is THE
    resolver, and it deliberately refuses the empty repo stub
    (data/thetadata_eod/_manifest.json n_roots=0). An M2/GH runner must never
    silently resolve the stub and publish NO_SIGNAL.
  - >-
    The entire host-side intraday options launchd fleet (15 units incl. the sparse-selector
    canary) is NOT loaded on the Mac Studio as of 2026-08-17 (verified launchctl probes,
    AD-0 ledger §2.3). Do not treat in-repo plists under ops/launchd/ as running machinery.
    Intraday options production/classification authority stays with Terminal — AD
    authorizes no duplicate intraday collector.
  - >-
    Exactly one options-derived input reaches live Prophet rank: gex_confirm_verdict in C1
    fusion, lawful solely via DNR:KILL-POSITIONING-FUSION Amendment 1. Any wider fusion of
    positioning keys outside that arena remains ILLEGAL.
  - >-
    The Macro host intraday options fleet is DISARMED BY DEFAULT pending the AD-9 ruling
    (Sol review on #5830) — do not load, install, or re-arm any ops/launchd options unit.
  - >-
    Historical/preregistered campaign and episode evidence is preserved append-only even
    where its runtime is retired (Sol review on #5830) — retirement never deletes evidence.
  - >-
    LEGACY (Massive/Polygon estate, no longer on the AD-1 path): HTTP 403
    NOT_AUTHORIZED on /v3/snapshot/options/{symbol} is an account entitlement failure
    on the legacy source; missing polygon_gex chain sessions 2026-08-14/17/18 are
    permanent (point-in-time OI) — do not hand-write those parquet files, and do not
    backfill the polygon_gex store from ThetaData (the stores keep separate identities).
  - >-
    Cboe delayed quote pages expressly prohibit automated extraction. Not an AD-1 fallback.

    chains and 200 on stock/news with the same linked key. Legacy context only —
    restoration of that entitlement is no longer an AD objective.
  - >-
    SUPERSEDED 2026-08-22 (DEC:AD-OPTIONS-CANONICAL-SOURCE-THETADATA): the former
    "do not silently route AD-1 to ThetaData" row guarded against a silent source
    swap pending a Sol-commissioned adjudication. That adjudication is now the
    Chairman source ruling: ThetaData IS the canonical options source and wave
    AD-1T0 executes the cutover explicitly. What remains prohibited: a parallel
    Massive-vs-ThetaData dual-truth store, and any second intraday collector.
  - >-
    Sparse selector / W1A is RESEARCH-ONLY. Do not resurrect before the AD-9 ruling.
next_action: >
  AD-1T1 is PROVEN_LIVE and must not be reopened or rerun merely to show activity.
  The exact next product dependency is AD-1T2: restore the store-bearing M1 to the
  theta-m1 product workflow and production-prove AD-1 end to end, including the
  consumer/availability path needed by downstream Options Alpha PIT composition.
  AD-2 remains CLOSED until AD-1 production acceptance. Broken R2 sync is not an
  AD-1T2 prerequisite unless new evidence proves it necessary.

## Context

AD-0, AD-1P0, AD-1, AD-1C0, and AD-1C0.1 are done (merge SHAs in the wave rows).
AD-1 state = BUILT_NOT_PROVEN.

**Source authority (Chairman ruling 2026-08-22,
DEC:AD-OPTIONS-CANONICAL-SOURCE-THETADATA): ThetaData is the canonical
Mastermind options-data source** — EOD chains, open interest, Greeks/IV,
trade + NBBO, and Terminal intraday. Massive/Polygon is a stock-data source,
not an options source authority. The prior entitlement blocker and needs_ceo
gate are retired; credential-security cleanup on the legacy key lives outside
this workstream.

The canonical T1 store lives on the M1 host
(`/Users/chriswong/theta-ops-wt/data/thetadata_eod`, resolved ONLY via
`engine.thetadata_store.resolve_thetadata_store()`), fed by the theta launchd
lanes (`com.macro.theta-terminal`, `com.macro.thetadata-backfill`,
`com.macro.thetadata-r2sync`, `com.macro.theta-staleness`). daily.yml pins
ThetaData-consuming jobs to the theta-m1 runner labels.

The repo-local `data/thetadata_eod/` is an EMPTY STUB (`n_roots=0`) and must
never be treated as production truth — the resolver refuses it by design.

`site/options_intel_brief.json` is built from the canonical ThetaData store
since AD-1T0 (PR #6253, merge a45ac6f58e63): honest
`board_state=INSUFFICIENT_COVERAGE` at 39/375 = 0.104 source coverage. The
coverage blocker is the T1 spine's 48-root daily refresh
(DSC:THETADATA-T1-SPINE-DAILY-REFRESH-IS-48-ROOTS); AD-1T1 replaces that
whole-year refresh with a full-universe one-session incremental maintainer —
the ~19h full-universe estimate was a property of the whole-year re-pull
design, not of one-day vendor throughput (Sol ruling, AD-1T1 handoff §0).
