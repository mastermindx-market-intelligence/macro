title: US Prophet structural late-entry diagnosis and reduction
objective: >
  Diagnose and materially reduce structural late-entry behavior in US Prophet without
  unacceptable false-positive cost. Done = a measured entry-timing delta on held-out
  episodes with the false-positive cost printed alongside it.

## Context

One of five active company P0 objectives (`US_PROPHET_ENTRY_TIMING` in Mastermind
`config/strategic_state.yml`). The backfill completed and the queue drained on 2026-08-11;
the open question is whether the first post-backfill bake is clean.
