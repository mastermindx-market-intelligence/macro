title: Executive Capacity Fabric — heterogeneous provider and subscription placement
objective: >
  Let Sol/Fable/Executive OS use the company's real AI capacity as one governed workforce:
  discover usable provider/account capacity without exposing credentials, preserve provider-
  native quota/cooling truth, choose among already-eligible workers deterministically, prefer
  subscription/local capacity where policy permits, preserve frontier reserves, and continue
  safely across quota exhaustion without creating duplicate execution or another lifecycle plane.

      SOURCE_REPAIR_RELEASED_DO_NOT_REPEAT. Mastermind PR #213 repaired the current-carrier versus
      immutable-repair provenance split on the single canonical H0 carrier and source-released the
      final authenticated v3 H0 material as protected
      229aebce5e8d0c1c7372f5fead9c24516b027cc1 after full repository test, CodeQL/static and exact-head
      Sol review. That SHA remains the immutable REPAIR_MERGE_SHA unless a later separately accepted
      H0 source-repair release supersedes it. Source transport is BUILT_NOT_PROVEN / PRODUCTION_INERT,
      not native acceptance. At every native attempt re-pin CURRENT protected Mastermind rather than
      freezing the historical release as the carrier. At the 2026-09-13 record repair protected master is
      89d890f0ae526205e762ad2924b6590f35847e8f, which sits 152 commits past the previous
      dfd69451dce5e186ce05f65446023fbe21f07a58 pin (that pin is an ancestor of it) through source merges
      including RF1 #449, CAP-C2 #415, OCR-1 #453 and HF1-A #471. Repair ANCESTRY still holds at this pin —
      229aebce5e8d0c1c7372f5fead9c24516b027cc1 is an ancestor of 89d890f0ae526205e762ad2924b6590f35847e8f —
      but the five-path mode/blob EQUALITY half of the reproof was not re-run by this records-only repair, so
      89d890f0ae526205e762ad2924b6590f35847e8f is a verified protected-master pin and NOT a proven
      CARRIER_COMMIT_SHA. REPAIR_MERGE_SHA remains
      229aebce5e8d0c1c7372f5fead9c24516b027cc1. Before any v3 build or root action, re-prove the current
      carrier is a protected descendant of the immutable repair and that all five authenticated H0
      Git mode/blob rows are exactly equal at both pins. If protected master advances again, advance
      only CARRIER_COMMIT_SHA after that same reproof; never relabel the immutable repair. Then use
      accepted Macro dcdd939c45b23abce5ba04f95e330ac914a3904b, build the final v3 carrier and run
      exactly one bounded administrator ceremony from the reviewed runbook. Require source-repair PASS,

## Capability state

CF1 is accepted and merged in Macro as `dcdd939c45b23abce5ba04f95e330ac914a3904b`.
CF2-F is accepted and merged in Mastermind as `e9cb5cbd745b36dc51f54bd83238ec38ef0c80c7`.
OCR-1 Tasks 1–2 provider-work-free Claude preflight is accepted and merged in Mastermind #184 as
`1d5ad1249172e8b93882f0dff157fc13636dd62d`; it remains `BUILT_NOT_PROVEN` / production-inert and
proves no live realm, capacity identity or routing. OCR-1 Task 4 is separately commissioned RED-first.

The first independent P0 census correctly refused with `NO_SAFE_CF1_ACQUISITION_PATH`; H0 code then
merged in Mastermind #157 and source-closure repair #200 merged as `e53f524230ffc4e8730c844f6fc319d50a2050f3`.
Subsequent protected-master movement exposed a runbook provenance collision between exact current carrier
and immutable repair identity. Mastermind #213 repaired that split on the single canonical H0 carrier and
released the bounded v3 source transport as protected `229aebce5e8d0c1c7372f5fead9c24516b027cc1`
after full required repository test, CodeQL/static and exact-head Sol review. Protected master later advanced
to `dfd69451dce5e186ce05f65446023fbe21f07a58` through records-only watcher-resource design #205, and at the
2026-09-13 record repair it stands at `89d890f0ae526205e762ad2924b6590f35847e8f` — 152 commits past
`dfd69451...`, which is an ancestor of it. The immutable repair remains `229aebce...` and is also an ancestor
of `89d890f0...`, so repair ANCESTRY holds at the new pin; the runbook's exact five-path mode/blob EQUALITY
reproof was not re-run by this records-only repair, so the carrier axis is reported, not proven. Source law
is no longer the H0 blocker, but the implementation remains `BUILT_NOT_PROVEN` / production-inert until the
final native v3 build and administrator ceremony produce the required installed-host receipts.

RF1 is accepted and merged in Mastermind #449 as `cc03ea329148a44b048b65a4649481d637980dd3` (2026-09-04) and
HF1-A is accepted and merged in Mastermind #471 as `66a1125c4e0f02351f33dbf8c8583eb19ea1d2e4` (2026-09-07);
both merge commits are ancestors of protected master `89d890f0...`. Both are SOURCE CAPABILITY ONLY: RF1's
ordered suitability tiers prove no capacity-ranked claim, and HF1-A's provider-neutral execution contract
proves no live worker realm, Ready receipt or Executive Job launch. Capacity-aware placement, real
multi-account routing/fan-out, automatic heterogeneous placement, the HF1-B/HF1-C/HF1-D harness slices, PF1
first real non-Codex worker and MH1 multi-host transport are not production-proven.

OCR-2C Family A has returned `FAMILY_A_NO_SAFE_EQUALITY_WITNESS` and
`FAMILY_A_NO_ROTATION_INVALIDATION`: current native Claude evidence plus existing Provider Control slot
identity cannot safely prove that a native realm and `claude_code_oauth_N` are the same paid subscription
across rotation without forbidden account/secret coupling. This refusal is a successful falsifier result,
not permission to weaken identity. Family B architecture is the next design gate and must preserve the
real underlying native Claude realm capacity identity rather than collapsing it into a synthetic ordinal.

The program remains `PARTIAL`.

## Wave 1 open carriers (Mastermind, pinned 2026-09-13)

Fable principal integration, operation `agent-fabric-end-to-end-fable-integration-20260913-sol-001`, Wave 1,
under ruling `orch/fabric/INTEGRATION_RULING_W1.md` (Fable, 2026-09-13). Heads and titles were read with
`gh pr list -R mastermindx-market-intelligence/Mastermind --state open --limit 100 --json number,title,headRefName,headRefOid,isDraft`;
all seven are DRAFT and none is merged. A head recorded here is a pin, not a promise — re-read it before
acting on it, and never merge, rebase, label or ready one of these carriers from a records-only session.

| PR | Head | Role (one line) |
|---|---|---|
| #575 | `420c4228` | ACP probe: qualify the provider-free SDK boundary and conformance with no real provider work. |
| #579 | `8ee3128d` | ACP turn driver: bind the guarded native ACP worker to the common worker receipts. |
| #576 | `43c24484` | HF1-B: configure the existing worker broker by provider-neutral adapter identity. |
| #578 | `ed3ed5e0` | HF1-C: add reviewed GLM, Alibaba and MiniMax subscription profiles (carries ruling R1). |
| #581 | `e6aca940` | HF1-D: add the fixed-profile Claude subscription worker (Wave 1 rebase per ruling R3). |
| #583 | `d20a4226` | HF1-D: bind subscription plans to reviewed worker harnesses. |
| #577 | `264fa51a` | Provider fabric v2: add MiniMax and Alibaba subscription realms to the Codex worker (DRAFT/HOLD). |

#578 moved after the Wave 1 packet was cut: the packet pinned `5d786da2`, the live head is
`ed3ed5e06c0a45c06a2709b3ac77acdda05fd229`, and
`gh api repos/mastermindx-market-intelligence/Mastermind/compare/5d786da2...ed3ed5e0` returns
`status: ahead, ahead_by: 1, behind_by: 0`. The one added commit is the ruling-R1 amendment
"fix(exec): decouple provider profiles from harness selection" — purchased-plan profiles no longer pin a
global adapter — so R1 is already on the branch as a fast-forward descendant, not a divergent rewrite.

## 10/10 end-state

A real Sol mission is decomposed through accepted Executive/COO law; child Jobs can land on
heterogeneous subscription/API/local workers according to suitability, independence and fresh
capacity; one provider can become cooling/exhausted without duplicate execution; a different
eligible provider can take later safe work; independent review/repair still follows Executive
lineage; claim receipts explain why each worker was selected while the closed placement identity
remains stable; the existing Model Router defines provider-neutral suitability tiers while capacity
selects only within the first lawful tier; one provider-neutral harness/broker lifecycle executes
approved Codex/supported-tool/ACP adapters without vendor-specific queues or brokers; one canonical
Executive Runtime can later drive bounded worker brokers on multiple authenticated physical hosts
without copying provider credentials or creating per-host lifecycle state; the Control Room can
later project workforce/capacity truth without owning it; and the Chairman does not manually choose
providers, watch quotas, assign Macs or carry messages between sessions.

## Learning boundary

Later descriptive metrics may include provider reliability, capacity evidence age, quota
utilisation, marginal API spend avoided, host availability, remote transport reliability, repair
rate and independent-review catches. They are operational learning signals only. Provider
sentiment/summary/model output never gains market, portfolio, authority or capital control from
this workstream.
