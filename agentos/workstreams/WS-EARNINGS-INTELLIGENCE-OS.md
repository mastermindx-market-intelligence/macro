key: EARNINGS-INTELLIGENCE-OS
title: Earnings Intelligence OS — E0 freeze through E2 golden workspace
objective: >
  Finish the Company Event / Earnings Intelligence product over the existing
  provenance substrate. Done for this workstream's first arc means E0 artifacts
  are merged, E1 binds AAPL FY2026 Q3 into event_workspace.v1, and E2 renders
  that payload in the existing Terminal workspace and dossier glance.
status: done

  E2 arc is complete (E2-T1 Terminal + E2-D public dossier live). Return to Sol
  for E3 reassessment. Do not begin E3, slides, Q&A ML, publisher work, or
  corpus backfill from this workstream.

do_not_redo:
  - Rebuild Terminal transcripts, Stage, Group Reads, TIL, or a standalone earnings app.
  - Treat Earnings Wire excerpt archive as the finished intelligence product.
  - Listing-key dual-class events (GOOG/GOOGL) as two issuers.
  - Treat a production-shaped reader test as proof the R2 object exists.
  - Publish E1 test fixtures as production event_workspace truth.
  - Parse EDGAR `-index-headers.html` without html.unescape.
  - Re-read the closed v1 score overlay for the E2 glance.
  - Broaden E2 into E3+, slides, Q&A ML, or a second publisher.
  - Reopen Terminal E2-T1 product, Results taxonomy, receipt copy, or #420 CSS ownership.
landmines:
  - v1 CI requires claim_citations_pending == true; do not flip the v1 invariant.
  - public_wire completeness is forced transcript-only; changing it is a contract change.
  - Calendar freshness can look green on the newest stamp while coverage is 17.9%.
  - LMND Wire Q2 vs CI Q1 proves "generated_at today" is not "latest event current".

E0 is research/design only. E1/E2 are the first vertical slice. Later waves E3–E15 live in the V2 masterplan and are out of this workstream's immediate next_action.
