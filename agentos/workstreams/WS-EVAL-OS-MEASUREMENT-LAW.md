title: Intelligence Evaluation OS — the measurement law wave (horizon clock, market ruler, promotion legality)
objective: >
  Make the qledger Universal Scoreboard measure what it says it measures: every claim
  declares its horizon UNIT, one resolver answers check_by/maturity/grading/render, the
  market ruler is the exchange the claim is priced on, promotion arithmetic is
  direction-correct and legality-gated, and forward-only registration starts a real
  evidence clock. Done when three desks are accruing prospective claims at their own
  declared rulers and no published promotion number is computed on a basis it was not
  measured on.

      control. thematic_desk still has no durable general clock. The old E1 worker child was
      terminally stopped for stale worker continuity after its effects were reconciled. A fresh
      bounded E1 recovery child must classify why the already-wired real US thematic nightly path
      yielded no registrable thesis/claim, produce the first lawful thematic prospective claim +
      clock when the underlying desk actually makes one (or repair only a proven blocking defect),
      and return explicit real grader/cohort proof that pre-clock rows are excluded.

next_action: >
  Place and execute fresh child eval-os-e1-thematic-cohort-recovery-20260829-sol-001 under the
  current protected Skillpack. Do not redo the stock repair or stock general-clock start. Close the
  remaining E1 truth gap: classify the real US thematic zero-output path, obtain the first lawful
  thematic_desk prospective clock from real production without manufacturing a thesis, and prove
  the real grader/cohort excludes pre-clock rows. Preserve demand_chain's runner-local control law
  and stock matched-control NOT STARTED state until real governed evidence changes it.

## Reconciliation — 2026-08-27

The 2026-08-14 W4/W5 next actions were stale. #5534 (append-only), #5577 (forward-only desk
registration) and #5584 (legacy-clock authority firewall) are merged. P0d/#5609 plus
#5665/#5672 resolved the control-policy question. Real production evidence later showed that
`demand_chain` started its general prospective clock at `2026-08-19T08:10:37.995754+00:00` and
its matched-control clock at `2026-08-19T08:10:37.332100+00:00` with control `XLU`, while the
tracked general clock estate still had no `stock_desk` or `thematic_desk` start. Therefore W4
remained genuinely in progress for natural-time accrual, not for old PR merges; W5 was done.

This workstream owns measurement law, not a new promotion authority and not the engines that
produce claims. T1 remains the single derived engine-registry sibling and is already done under
its own bounded completion law.

## Recovery reconciliation — 2026-08-29

The original E1 child `eval-os-e1-clock-accrual-20260827` produced two accepted implementation
repairs before its worker dialogue went dark: #6598 fixed stock/thematic anchor-at-registration
without weakening the forward gate, and #6607 persisted qledger state from the stock-briefs
production lane. Current canonical main now contains a real `stock_desk` clock receipt with
`first_prospective_registration_utc=2026-08-29T11:08:11.609328+00:00`, and current qledger
`run_status.json` is a post-clock real grading run (`generated_at=2026-08-29T14:56:46.111593Z`,
264 grades that run). The stock general-clock sub-capability is therefore `PROVEN_LIVE`.

No current `thematic_desk.json` evidence-clock receipt exists. The authoritative nightly path was
observed executing through the existing basket/allocation/thematic-desk chain, so the remaining
question is downstream of generic scheduling: current US state may lawfully yield no thesis, a
proxy/scorability gate may refuse it, the model/parse/fail-soft path may suppress output, or a real
product/policy defect may exist. The successor must classify that branch before modifying anything.
It may never fabricate a thematic thesis merely to start a clock.

The old E1 child received terminal `SOL CLOSED / STOP` on Slack thread
`C0BSBM78V1N/1787896831.113919` at message `1788024583.456369`; its temporary watcher was ordered
disarmed. The parent Eval OS program remains active. A fresh recovery child is required for the
remaining thematic + cohort proof rather than silently moving the old worker/session.
