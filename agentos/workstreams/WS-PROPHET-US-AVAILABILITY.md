key: PROPHET-US-AVAILABILITY
title: Prophet US never-stale availability program
objective: >
  Prophet US picks are produced and served for every NYSE session with automated
  detection, bounded self-heal, and loud escalation when unhealable — no outage ever
  again discovered by an operator looking at the site. Done = a full market week where
  every staleness/kill injection in the drill list is caught by an instrument (not a
  human) and healed or escalated within its deadline.

  2026-08-27 CEO-takeover wave (handoff
  agentos/handoffs/PROPHET-US-AVAILABILITY-2026-08-27-ceo-takeover.md): permanence
  net PR #6534 and display-truth PR #6532 armed on merge-on-green. Verify tonight's
  B1 nightly (run 33036497832) yields a fresh session-2026-08-26 board live, close
  the open prophet-outage issues with receipts, then observe #6534's two §0
  production proofs on NATURAL runs (never dispatch to force them). W2's full
  fire-drill week remains the program done-bar; chip follow-ups
  task_7df1337c/b0e6bfee/a194ca27/0c033ef2 close the known instrument gaps.

      The original "land the availability-hardening PR" action is stale because its
      response/liveness/rescue layers are on main. Re-pin their accepted receipts and
      identify the bounded W0 closure delta before changing status; this A1 acceptance
      is not W0 acceptance and does not authorize recreating the original carrier.

      Operator runs scripts/install_prophet_rescue_launchd.sh once on the Mac Studio;
      arbitration of codex session rollout-2026-08-11T04-10-51 (six receipted

      Inject each failure class in staging form (stale fixture, mock cancelled run) and
      verify catch+heal+receipt paths — now including W3's wedge/hostage class (a run

      then declare the workstream's done-bar met or iterate.

      The original "merge the hardening PR" action is stale. A1 proves one US
      natural-night absorption and the separate-cron behavior only; W3 remains in
      progress until all five Prophet boards and its outstanding operator asks are
      reconciled. Then carry wedge/hostage/ruleset classes into W2's injection matrix.
landmines:
  - "A queued job on a runner label with no live runner holds its RUN alive ~24h and the run holds its per-cron concurrency group — the next night pends with zero jobs (DSC:QUEUED-JOB-HOSTAGE-HOLDS-THE-NIGHTLY-CRON-GROUP). Check job runs-on labels against the live pool before any other diagnosis."
  - "A push-blocking ruleset kills publishes while builds stay green; `gh api repos/{o}/{r}/rulesets` is the FIRST check on mysterious GH013s (DSC:RULESET-FREEZE-BLINDS-EVERY-BUILD-INSTRUMENT)."
  - "Rescue §0.4a is amended (DEC:PROPHET-NIGHTLY-WEDGE-HARDENING): a PROVEN wedge dispatches through; everything unproven still refuses. Do not 'simplify' the fail-closed inputs."
  - "Top-level index.json asof is wall-clock — sentinels must read source_asof + cohorts (DSC:PROPHET-ASOF-IS-WALL-CLOCK)."
  - "Run conclusions decouple from Prophet delivery in both directions (DSC:CANCELLED-DAILY-RUN-CAN-STILL-DELIVER-PROPHET)."
  - "Never dispatch over a queued/in_progress daily run; never exceed the 2/night auto-budget — livelock and dispatch-storm classes are both measured, not hypothetical."
  - "Force-majeure reconstruction defaults to the narrow authority in DEC:FORCE-MAJEURE-SESSIONS-ARE-BACKFILLED-BY-DEFAULT: the one authorized Aug-14 PIT replay is absorbed and must not be rerun; reconstructed rows stay unmarked, and data-defect windows remain outside that authority. The 2026-08-11 no-origination/no-bake-time facts remain historical evidence, not a blanket prohibition that supersedes the later DEC."
  - "GitHub concurrency supersedes PENDING runs even when cancel-in-progress is false (DSC:GITHUB-CONCURRENCY-SUPERSEDES-PENDING). daily.yml DST crons must keep distinct groups (DEC:DAILY-CRON-SLOT-CONCURRENCY-GROUPS)."
do_not_redo:
  - "Do not re-investigate GitHub platform incidents for Aug 11-13 2026 — githubstatus history checked, zero Actions incidents; the outage was self-inflicted (workflow-size strand, fleet force-cancels, runner disk-full)."
  - "Do not build a second detection check duplicating PR #5487's run-created/run-concluded/source_asof arms."
  - "Do not 'fix' a queued daily.yml cancel by flipping cancel-in-progress or by putting both DST crons back in one group — that is the 2026-08-14/15 kill (DEC:DAILY-CRON-SLOT-CONCURRENCY-GROUPS)."

## Context

Born from the 2026-08-11/13 outage: two NYSE sessions with no fresh picks, discovered
by the operator. Full incident record + architecture:
`research/PROPHET_US_AVAILABILITY_HARDENING_2026-08-14.md`. Detection sibling:
PR #5487 (nightly-liveness). Related but distinct workstream:
WS:PROPHET-US-ENTRY-TIMING (signal quality, not availability).
