key: FLOW-OBSERVATORY-V2
title: Flow Observatory V2 — production-proven CN/HK flow context surface
objective: >
  Upgrade flow_velocity.html from a semantically overstated normalized-flow dashboard
  into a source-separated, correction-safe, point-in-time, coverage-aware Flow
  Observatory. Done means the W1..W7 waves of
  research/FLOW_OBSERVATORY_V2_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md are merged and live-verified:
  trust strip, absolute-vs-relative truth (quadrants), binding source-quality states,
  PIT observation history with corrections, official-vs-curated lenses with
  contribution/concentration, calibrated descriptive method, research workflow, and
  product-learning events — all context_only.

    −0.008, never scored into allocation) survives every wave; validation_meta group-flow
    forecast weights stay zero."
  - "engine/cn_theme_tape.py consumes desk.json ashare_sectors state/state_zh verbatim and
    tests/test_cn_theme_tape.py pins the exact strings — any vocabulary change updates the
    consumer + tests in the same PR, after a consumer sweep (~15 unverified grep-hit
    readers listed in masterplan §2.2)."
  - "The committed site page carries post-render externalized CSS (assets/css/*.css?v=);
    the canonical artifact = builder output + lib/pages.py sweeps — never hand-commit raw
    builder output as site truth."

  - "No second membership truth store — curated themes stay baskets_china/baskets_hk;
    official SW L1 membership extends collectors/china_sectors.py with forward accrual,
    never hindsight backfill, never relabeled curated baskets."
  - "No second alert engine, analytics plane, market calendar, or flow collector for an
    existing source."

# Flow Observatory V2

Canonical plan: `research/FLOW_OBSERVATORY_V2_MASTERPLAN_BY_FABLE.md` (outcome, archaeology,
frozen contracts, wave graph, no-rebuild boundaries). Program parent: `china-system`
(flow_velocity.html is CN/HK cross-border + A-share market mechanics; no prior workstream
owned this surface — verified `grep -rn flow_velocity agentos/` empty at freeze;
WS-CHINA-ALPHA-INTELLIGENCE is the disjoint Prophet-ordering sibling under the same
program; WS-INTRADAY-FLOW-P0-RECOVERY owns a different page).
