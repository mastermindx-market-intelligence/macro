objective: >
  Freeze a financial-alpha defense architecture, then implement it as bounded
  waves D0R through D20 over the existing Government Revenue substrate. Done for
  D0R = current-state truth, driver taxonomy, historical casebook method,
  source/rights/PIT registry, graph/contract freeze, golden universe, real-data
  experience architecture, and exact D1-D4 handoffs exist; no production mutation.

      (historical) D6-B1 coverage-aware continuation 2026-08-25. The U4
      HOLD was RELEASED by the D6-B1 continuation commission (Chairman
      channel, in-session relay 2026-08-25; full text preserved in the
      D6-B1 continuation handoff): the U4 discovery is ACCEPTED —
      State+DSCA web surfaces are non-exhaustive — and the old
      web-surface population assumption is REPLACED by the frozen
      official-union coverage law. Scope 2026-01-01→claim-time. Build:
      FR bounded denominator/recovery + State current presentation
      observations + DSCA historical observations → transmittal-number
      dedupe → canonical GovRev FMS records → explicit source/coverage
      manifest → existing ninth fms mode → production proof. Under
      D6-B1, FR may RECOVER (mint) a case that is absent from both web
      surfaces — hostile case: 26-23 Jordan must be canonically present
      despite State/DSCA web absence; 26-28 Japan must not disappear
      because the State corpus omits it; 26-27 Sweden stays the
      positive web case. All B0 laws preserved: stage authority stops
      at congressional_notification; review-period expiry advances
      nothing; estimated_notification_value never award/backlog/
      revenue/cash; contractor prose mints no issuer identity; system
      similarity mints no D5 link; append-only corrections; no
      award_change abuse; no new general event store. New mandatory
      hostile cases: cross-family duplicate → one transmittal; FR
      publication lag cannot rewrite congressional-delivery time;
      missing web page never VALID_EMPTY; zero official denominator
      reconciliation cannot pass publication silently. Prior U4-hold
      evidence stands (fms_cutover_sweep_2026-08-25.json +
      fms_u4_fr_denominator_2026-08-25.json; step-2 re-receipts incl.
      SAMM C5.7 sha b98a113875f4). Stop after the FMS vertical is
      production-proven and return to Sol. D6-C+ and D7+ remain
      UNAUTHORIZED. D5 unchanged (BUILT_NOT_PROVEN).

      against Macro main 4ac1c60e408f and Skillpack Mastermind@b901dee0
      (docs/sol_skills byte-identical to the dispatch pin d508e30c).
      Capability ledger: SBIR/STTR DARK_OR_DISCONNECTED (built, registered in
      synapse.yml/dag.yml/collect.py/append_only_artifacts.json/legacy-jobs.yml
      since PR #5012 on 2026-08-09, yet zero committed artifacts, zero product
      consumers, zero contract schema files against five contract names in
      code); DoD/service contract announcements REJECTED_BY_DESIGN as
      population authority per the D0R registry; GAO protest, DOT&E/IG and
      DLA/DIBBS NOT_BUILT; DIU/AFWERX/OTA SPEC_ONLY. Recommendation is ONE
      vertical — complete SBIR/STTR to PROVEN_LIVE — chosen because it is the
      only remaining rail with a documented open machine-readable population
      authority, which the binding D6-B official-union law requires; the
      higher-value adverse-event rails would rest on WAF-protected web as
      population, which that law forbids. Its lower investor value is stated
      in the freeze rather than argued away, and three named conditions would
      flip the recommendation to GAO. Gate 0 of any authorized SBIR wave is to
      reproduce the SBIR.gov response FROM THE RUNNER using the header
      discipline in collectors/fms_notifications_live.py:503-507; if the
      source refuses under documented terms the lawful outcome is to record
      SBIR REJECTED_BY_DESIGN with evidence and return to Sol, never a blind
      retry or failover. Any user-facing consumer must be sized against the
      302,890 B live-lane peak of site/government_revenue.html (214 bytes
      under the 303,104 fence), not the ~25.9 KB visible at HEAD, and the
      fence must not be bumped. Collision census clean: zero of 37 open PRs
      touch any owns_paths entry, verified twice against origin/main with the
      instrument positive-controlled. No implementation rail is
      self-authorized; D7 is not started; D5 remains BUILT_NOT_PROVEN and
      untouched. Awaiting Sol ruling on the recommended vertical.
landmines:
  - "Live page is government_revenue.html (underscore). government-revenue.html 404s."
  - "Access (site_full / 401 locked) is independent of epistemics (display/context_only). Do not conflate them."
  - "Reviewed recipient graph on HEAD is defense21-v1 as of #5932 (defense19 rows byte-preserved). #5424 defense20-v1 is CLOSED/superseded by defense21-v1 — do not merge, revive, or recut it (Sol, D4 charter 2026-08-20)."
  - "government-revenue-live can build-and-prove a projection and still fail to publish; prior live projection stays authoritative until commit complete evidence projection lands (run 32112383533 did not publish; run 32177051815 did)."
  - "Radar 48 is the coherent published queue, not 26 new awards. Ledger line_count is append-only audit and is not required to equal Radar."
  - "Session worktrees are sparse by default. Never write into omitted data/ — that truncates the committed artifact."
  - "DNR:LAW-REVIEWED-MANIFEST-CENSUS — a reviewed recipient graph cannot re-time itself."
  - "SPR is not a live issuer (Boeing close 2025-12-08; absent from Stock Identity universe)."
  - "government_revenue.html has a ratcheted RAW_HTML_BUDGET_BYTES fence (296 KiB since #6059). Template growth ships INLINE in the page — bake locally (scripts/build_government_revenue._write_site_projection) before merging template edits, or the shared render lane fails at the govrev step. D3's first cut left 65 bytes of headroom."
  - "The real createGovernmentRevenueBudget module EXISTS in government-revenue-dossiers.js (BSD grep hides it — use grep -a). Its HTTP-receipt status is authoritative; the typed freshness.budget fallback applies only when no module loaded."
do_not_redo:
  - "Do not start original D0. V2/D0 remain historical records only."
  - "Do not implement collectors, schemas, UI, Neural Web, or Prophet members in D0R."
  - "Do not create a second SEC, transcript, estimate, price, options, theme, identity, tenant, Neural Web, or Prophet plane."
  - "Do not treat GovTribe/GovCon capture parity as the product north star."
  - "Do not grant rank, gate, size, entry, or execution authority."
  - "Do not treat SPR as a live golden ticker."
  - "Do not invent 60 VERIFIED_CASE primaries."
  - "Do not merge, revive, or recut #5424 — superseded by defense21-v1 (#5932). Do not start D3 until Sol authorizes it."
  - "Do not rewrite collector awarding_agency hashes to flatten nested USAspending objects."
  - "Do not assert Candidate Radar must equal historical 22. Prove cookie = bearer = UI for the live content_id."
  - "Do not hand-advance the candidate ledger. Do not change recipient mappings to make counts nicer."
  - "Do not re-baseline. Do not revive an et_gate mutex."

  D6-B is SOL ACCEPTED / PROVEN_LIVE (2026-08-26; Macro PR #6480 comment
  5432443653). WS:DEFENSE-PROCUREMENT-V3 is PARKED at the accepted D6-B
  authorization boundary. Exact next action: no defense mutation until an
  explicit Chairman/Sol commission names the next bounded wave; before any
  such commission is executed, re-pin the protected Sol Skillpack and current
  repository state and reconcile collisions. D6-C+, D7+, GAO, DOT&E, IG and
  every later defense rail remain UNAUTHORIZED. D5 remains CLOSED FOR PROGRAM
  SEQUENCING but capability state BUILT_NOT_PROVEN: the entitled D5P browser
  journey is deferred/nonblocking, not silently satisfied by D6-B proof.
  Nonblocking D6-B reliability debt remains visible in the Sol acceptance
  handoff: 391-byte page-fence headroom, fms-acquire commit-back retry design,
  staged-State/freshness cadence, the pre-existing premium.enforced_early
  configuration gap, and validator/dependency maintenance. None authorizes a
  duplicate retry/publication/event/source plane or a product expansion.
  Publisher-vintage alarm and fixture-freezing the D2/D3 law suites out of
  the unrun-government-revenue holding pen remain separate follow-ups — do
  not fold them into the D5R close.

## Context

V3 architecture and the D0R handoff merged in #5803 (`455284b7beae`). D0R
closed on #5819 (`0d10acdd`) and was accepted; Gate 5 stays honest-labeled
