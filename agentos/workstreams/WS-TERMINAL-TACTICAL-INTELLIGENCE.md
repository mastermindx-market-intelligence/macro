title: Terminal Tactical Intelligence — session-aware short-horizon opportunities
objective: Upgrade Terminal from descriptive Day Trade Mode to an integrated, evidence-grounded workflow for forming
  and confirmed short-horizon opportunities, conditional exhaustion/reclaim and candidate extremes, extended-session
  context, and separately evaluated one-to-three-day follow-through. Completion requires real inputs, existing-Radar
  integration, visible Terminal/browser proof, prospective evaluation and species-specific promotion decisions;
  options expressions are separately evaluated.

Independent review is requested from mastermindx-2 and hosted checks are pending. Terminal #595 still owns refresh source: exact-head reproduction comments 5723524041/5723554467 prove failure masking and provide a disposable 47-pass minimal repair spike; consume the incumbent owner fix rather than creating a competing repair carrier. Then prove VendorMinuteReader correction/history/freshness semantics for the intended retrospective or prospective mode before #7275 can become production evidence.'

landmines:
- WS:LIVE-ENTRY-RADAR retains tactical event/evaluator ownership; this product-integration record does not create
  another radar, replay engine, store or WebSocket plane.
- WS:TECHNICAL-OPPORTUNITY-INTELLIGENCE retains its incumbent higher-timeframe setup/remaining-opportunity work.
  No existing wave or source custody is taken over.
- Setup Species and Evaluation OS remain the scientific owners. Context-only evidence is not rank, sizing, gating,
  trade or options-expression authority.
- Intraday top/HOD research must remain distinct from WS:TOP-ANATOMY winner-maturation/OOT research; no Top Anatomy threshold/OOT import and no automatic short/sell/trim authority. See DEC:TERMINAL-TACTICAL-TOP-SIDE-BOUNDARY.
- DSC:TERMINAL-TACTICAL-PILOT-HISTORY-QUALIFICATION distinguishes local-file absence, static publication, live freshness
  and historical availability.
- 'Terminal #595 is the existing refresh carrier. Do not modify its source without current custody reconciliation.'
do_not_redo:
- 'The Chairman approved the price-first architecture and first milestone on 2026-09-17; Terminal #598 comment 5720001976.
  Do not request that approval again.'
- 'D0 implementation exists on Terminal #601 at 773b16f8e825ab4b39ce3c7a5fa5caf32868d55f; do not create a replacement
  branch or rebuild the qualifier.'
- Do not retry the predecessor blocked live INTC API inspection through another tool or transport. Static non-INTC
  archival qualification is a separate completed operation.
- 'Session-chain qualification already exists at Terminal c0f36cb16fadd190ad747fc47a28405d9ec0fca4: 65 focused passes;
  exact original input hashes reused. Do not refetch/re-census the same archived files or treat nominal-grid counts
  as strategy accuracy.'
- 'Current Chairman correction: Executive is unfinished. Terminal #598 comment 5721925192 supersedes the prior user-reconnect
  prerequisite. Do not repeat Executive authentication probes or ask for design approval.'
- 'R1-A registration, implementation and corrected-history result are already on Macro #7270. Do not rerun the unchanged 84-cell grid or relax its thresholds after seeing outcomes; consume TTI_R1A_REPORT.md and DEC:TERMINAL-TACTICAL-R1A-DISPOSITION.'
- 'A bounded minute ambiguity resolver already exists on Macro #7275. Do not build another minute resolver, minute store or fetch plane; qualify and consume the existing Radar-owned seam if the PR is accepted.'

This record coordinates the approved Terminal product integration. Existing tactical and scientific owners remain controlling; no live execution is inferred from this authored record.


## 2026-09-17 direct-execution continuation
The Chairman correction removes the mistaken Executive-reconnect dependency. Independent source review advanced the current-history repair, and the first price-pattern/turn study now has a precise proposed measurement contract. New empirical implementation remains blocked by actual platform refusals, not by a need for further Chairman approval. The unfinished product retains its existing data/event/scientific owners.
