question: >
  Ingestion now retains 200 filings per run with a healthy storage verdict, but
  latest_source_filing_date remains 2026-07-31 while ~19k pending rows date to
  August 1. Should V2 raise MAX_FILINGS, or split work classes so live
  dissemination cannot be starved by historical debt?
answer: >
  Independent work classes LIVE_TAIL, RECOVERY, and HISTORICAL_BACKFILL with
  separate quotas and a live-tail freshness SLO. Health must report discovered,
  retained, and compiled material watermarks plus live-tail gap age. Compiler
  generation age is not information horizon. Do not raise MAX_FILINGS as the
  fix. Narrowest source extension is an overlay on the existing daily-index
  collector (evaluate SEC current-submissions/Atom), not a second store.
  Live-tail implementation is Wave 2, after identity Wave 1.
rationale: >
  Oldest-first selection plus a 200-filing cap is a rate budget that currently
  spends entirely on May-July debt. Projection coverage.freshness is already
  'fresh' against a 30h compiler SLA while the filing horizon is 18 days stale.
  Equating those is how the recovered system can claim health and still not
  know today's capital events. A larger cap would still let historical debt
  win every night. Concurrent collect and clocked identity make scaling
  retrieval unsafe until W1.
alternatives:
  - option: Increase MAX_FILINGS until the August backlog clears
    why_not: Burns rate budget, still has no live-tail SLO, and remints if
      identity is unfixed. Throughput is already healthy.
  - option: Drop historical pending rows
    why_not: Coverage debt is real; recovery and backfill remain required
      classes, just not allowed to starve live-tail.
  - option: Stand up a second SEC collector for real-time feeds
    why_not: Forbidden second truth store. Overlay enqueue onto the existing
      collector.

Proposed by the Cursor Grok 4.6 W0 session, not Fable. Sol accepted the
LIVE_TAIL / RECOVERY / HISTORICAL_BACKFILL split in the 2026-08-18 AMEND
review of PR #5901; it is not reopened. Program owner remains COO Fable.
Wave 2 implements the split. Wave 1 must land first so live-tail
re-observation does not remint evidence identities.
