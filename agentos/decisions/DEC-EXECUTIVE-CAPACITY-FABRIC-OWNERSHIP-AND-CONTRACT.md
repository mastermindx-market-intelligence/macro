key: EXECUTIVE-CAPACITY-FABRIC-OWNERSHIP-AND-CONTRACT
question: >
  Should heterogeneous Executive worker capacity be implemented by adding a new
  ProviderAccount/quota database inside Mastermind Executive OS, by importing Macro
  provider internals directly, or by projecting the existing Shared AI Provider Control
  Plane through one secret-free versioned capacity contract consumed by Executive placement?
answer: >
  Extend the existing `shared-ai-provider-control` program. Macro remains the canonical
  provider availability/auth-pool/cooling/quota-capacity owner and emits a deterministic,
  secret-free `mastermind.provider_capacity.v1` projection. Mastermind Model Router remains
  the stateless task-to-acceptable-model/execution-class filter. Executive OS remains the
  sole Job/Attempt/Worker/Event lifecycle and placement authority and may later consume the
  capacity projection when choosing among workers that are already eligible under its own
  route, authority, capability, independence and quota-registration law. Do not create a
  second provider/account/quota truth store.
rationale: >
  The provider substrate already exists and is materially richer than the older Phase 1G
  drafts assumed: Macro has multi-account Claude and Codex capability identities, isolated
  Codex homes, presence checks that do not open credentials, provider-reported and estimated
  budget evidence, cooling/reset semantics, provider-health error classes and a cross-repo
  provider-capacity boundary with Portfolio. Rebuilding those facts in Executive SQLite would
  create competing identities and correction semantics. Direct floating imports from Macro
  into Mastermind would instead couple Executive correctness to a moving implementation.
  A versioned projection preserves one canonical owner while giving Executive placement a
  stable, auditable input. The contract keeps unknown/stale evidence honest and can later
  express Z.AI/Alibaba subscription plans, ACP workers, metered APIs and local capacity
  without vendor-specific scheduler forks.
alternatives:
  - option: Add ProviderAccount, CapacityPool and QuotaHorizon tables to Executive SQLite
    why_not: >
      Duplicates Macro `shared-ai-provider-control`, creates a second credential/account/quota
      identity plane, and makes provider corrections race Executive lifecycle state. It also
      conflicts with the current sequencing in which Phase 1F-C owns schema v4.
  - option: Import `engine.neuralweb.key_pool`, `engine.llm_auth` and provider modules directly from Macro
    why_not: >
      The cross-repository audit already identifies floating implementation/version coupling
      as a hardening risk. Executive placement needs a versioned contract, not an implicit
      dependency on whatever Macro implementation happens to be checked out.
  - option: Put provider availability and quota logic into the Mastermind Model Router
    why_not: >
      Model suitability and live capacity answer different questions. Mixing them makes a
      deterministic task/model policy stateful and encourages provider health to redefine
      model quality or authority.
  - option: Build one scheduler/adapter policy per provider
    why_not: >
      Hard-codes vendor ordering, makes quota semantics incomparable, and forces every new
      coding-plan or ACP provider to grow another placement/control plane instead of joining
      one normalized capacity fabric.

## Operational consequence

Provider Control answers **what intelligence capacity exists and what is currently known about
its usability**. Model Router answers **what model/execution classes are acceptable for the
Job**. Executive OS answers **which already-eligible worker actually receives one Attempt**.
Neither provider observations nor model output grants authority.

`mastermind.provider_capacity.v1` is a projection, not a new lifecycle store. Its semantic
`snapshot_hash` deliberately excludes wall-clock `generated_at` and nonsemantic audit metadata,
so unrelated repository churn does not create false capacity changes. A later Executive claim
receipt must bind at least the exact `snapshot_hash` **and** exact `generated_at` used for the
freshness decision; the producing repository commit is retained separately as audit provenance.
Historical claim evidence never mutates when provider state is corrected later.

CF1's local producer/CLI proof does not itself define how Executive obtains the projection.
CF2-F must freeze the then-current secret-free acquisition seam. Executive may validate the
strict contract but may not import floating Macro implementation code or read raw provider
ledgers, auth files, provider homes or secret-bearing environment as a fallback.

## No-rebuild boundary

Do not add an Executive provider-account database, a second quota ledger, a second cooling
ledger, another host/session registry, a provider-specific scheduler, a long-lived bridge daemon
created only for convenience, or a hidden retry/failover plane. New providers extend Shared
Provider Control plus reviewed worker harnesses; they do not change the ownership law above.

## Accepted capacity-runtime fairness contract — design scope only

Integration accepted the exact revision-2 design package
`SHA256:7368ad403cde6917026636bb60c4e67ff5c7f8a6e03a55fa3a48b311dd3a4e42`.
The package and its source map are external evidence artifacts at
`/Users/chriswong/Documents/Cluade/exec-prestage-receipts/capacity-h0-census-20260905-01a06f73/`;
their hashes provide design provenance but do not make that local directory a Git authority.
Protected Macro records the portfolio acceptance separately in the two handoffs merged by
`8e49149233713f0983a9ebfdac6f437857dc8bcf`. This addendum does not supersede the F0
ownership decision: Macro Shared Provider Control remains the provider-fact owner, Model Router
remains the stateless suitability filter, and Executive Runtime remains the sole Job, Attempt,
Worker and Event owner.

For a separately authorized exact Runtime commission, the original allocation command event must
be strictly reconciled before admission transaction A and again in decision transaction B. The
actual original-command claim or proven noncommit result must persist and reconcile even when
optional measurement fails. Measurement failure degrades the affected coverage or denominator to
`UNKNOWN`; it cannot block otherwise lawful execution, shrink the denominator, create a retry,
or disguise an execution failure as an observation result. The current Event log and reserved
internal command namespace remain the only proposed admission/result topology: a committed claim
extends the existing original-command `JOB_CLAIMED`; a proven no-capacity/refusal/conflict result
has no Attempt, lease or selected Worker; an unprovable decision remains an explicit unknown for
canonical reconciliation.

The accepted initial domain is command-bound Executive-root Worker allocation. C2,
generated-ID and role-null paths are outside that frozen domain unless separately versioned.
Runtime derives in-scope membership, callers cannot opt out to hide a bypass, and a missing
comparable path prevents a global graduation claim. First-runnable eligibility is a write-once
source-owned Job/Event pair independent of measurement, so its age survives retry, backoff and
occupied capacity. A complete frozen comparable cohort, whole-epoch denominator, all-bypass
reporting, accepted realm-independence evidence and at most three unexplained comparable bypass
allocations per epoch remain prerequisites for any future fairness graduation.

The later commission must use the existing Runtime migration/backup owner for an explicit offline
M5 upgrade with backup, restore, quarantine and recovery proof; it may not make a writable
startup migration. It must propagate typed no-Attempt outcomes through the existing
Runtime/COO/service/supervisor path without a provider or harness action. Nothing here changes
the current dispatcher, C1 tie law, manual authority, existing fences, provider execution,
host state, or Worker harnesses, and it admits no second scheduler, lifecycle, store or
controller.

This acceptance is `SPEC_ONLY` with domain completion `PARTIAL`. It is neither a source `START`,
implementation acceptance, installed-host result, provider execution nor production fairness
proof. The source map's unavailable first-runnable history, full comparable cohort, allocation
weight/resource profile and accepted realm-independence facts remain `UNKNOWN` until existing
owners establish them through a separately authorized implementation and production proof.
