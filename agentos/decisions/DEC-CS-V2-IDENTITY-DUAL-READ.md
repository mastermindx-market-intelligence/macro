key: CS-V2-IDENTITY-DUAL-READ
question: >
  `manifest_id_for` hashes the full source-manifest body, including required
  retrieval clocks, so unchanged SEC bytes can mint a new manifest_id on
  re-retention. Historical IDs already sit under PIT receipts. How should V2
  become lawful under DNR:LAW-RUN-CLOCK-IN-CONTENT-IDENTITY without rewriting
  history or using git merge=union?
answer: >
  Forward-only dual-read. v1 rows keep validating under the current full-body
  hash. v2 hashes a declared content-binding subset and excludes retrieval and
  run clocks. first_seen_at freezes on first retention; later retrieves append
  an observation. Same content_sha256 + accession + document role is one
  evidence identity (keep-first). Do not rewrite historical manifest_id strings.
  Do not merge=union the JSONL. Content-aware merge lives in merge_manifest_ledgers
  and in CS-owned push conflict handling for this file only.
rationale: >
  Evidence bytes are already content-addressed and stable
  (storage.object_key = capital_structure/sec/sha256/{aa}/{sha256}). The DNR
  violation is the retention identity, not the object store. Sequential remints
  are masked by _eligible_complete_accessions; concurrent collect (measured
  possible; et_gate mutex rejected) is not. event_id hashes manifest_ids, so
  remints contaminate the spine. Govrev already declined merge=union on a
  prefix-hash JSONL for the same reason. Rewriting IDs would invalidate PIT
  receipts. Dual-read is the only compatibility path that is both lawful and
  non-destructive. Live-tail must not scale retrieval until this lands.
alternatives:
  - option: Rewrite all historical manifest_ids to the new hash
    why_not: Breaks existing PIT receipts, BioCatalyst read_ids, and any
      downstream fact_id that committed to the old string.
  - option: Leave identity unchanged and start live-tail first
    why_not: Live-tail increases re-observation and races; artifact count would
      measure cadence. The audit selected identity as the prerequisite.
  - option: Add merge=union on source_manifest.jsonl
    why_not: Union on a hash-bound ledger duplicates rows and breaks
      prefix_sha256 / source_ledger_receipt the same class as
      DSC:OVERLAPPING-DAILY-COLLECT-JOBS-LOSE-APPEND-ONLY-ROWS.
  - option: Hash only content_sha256 and drop manifests
    why_not: One accession has many documents; role and byte_length are
      content-binding. The manifest row is the receipt, not the bytes.

SUPERSEDED 2026-08-18 by Sol AMEND of PR #5901. Proposed by Cursor Grok 4.6,
not Fable. The dual-read / no-rewrite / no-merge=union core survives. The
frozen v2 hash subset, vague keep-first, and push-time content-aware merge of
source_manifest.jsonl do not. See `DEC:CS-V2-EVIDENCE-IDENTITY-OCCURRENCE-BYTES`.
