question: >
  AD-1C0's partial-replacement rule required the replacement capture's ET calendar
  date to equal the session date — but the production nightly's collect job
  measurably crosses midnight ET on ordinary nights (observed accrual instants
  18:20 ET to 00:42 ET; one clean cron sample ran 21:07 ET to 00:08 ET), so a
  lawful same-night post-midnight repair of a partial capture was refused. What
  clock law governs when a stored partial polygon_gex capture may be replaced?
answer: >
  A bounded lawful capture lease plus a measured same-book proof (Sol AD-1C0.1
  Option B, amended by Sol review 4989933857 on 2026-08-21). EVERY non-forced
  write for session S — first writes and replacements alike — requires (1); a
  replacement additionally requires (2) and (3):
  (1) LEASE — nyse_calendar.expected_last_session(capture_instant) == S AND the
  capture instant in ET falls strictly before 03:00 on the calendar day after S
  (LEASE_END_ET_HOUR = 3), bounding the window to the overnight hours contiguous
  with the session evening, before plausible overnight OI propagation and pre-market
  quoting, and structurally excluding Saturday/Sunday/Monday-preopen recapture of a
  Friday session; (2) SAME-BOOK PROOF — per-contract open-interest agreement on the
  stored/candidate contract intersection (vendor-ticker-preferred join, symmetric
  float32 grid on both sides, deterministic ordering; overlap floor
  min(stored contracts, max(20, ceil(0.25 x stored contracts))) — a real 25%
  floor with an absolute minimum of 20, bounded by the stored book's own size)
  — disagreement is skipped_vintage_mismatch,
  insufficient overlap or an unreadable store is skipped_unverifiable_vintage,
  outside the window is skipped_outside_lease; (3) the unchanged quality prongs
  (strictly more successes AND healthy-or-+0.10). The lease is evaluated BEFORE
  any vendor fetch — an outside-lease non-forced run records its refusal and
  spends zero API quota — and every gate decision persists audit fields in the
  health receipt (lease verdict/window/write_kind; overlap, required floor, and
  OI mismatch count when the proof ran). Healthy-immutability, write-ahead
  receipts, atomic writes, --force (recorded; an out-of-lease forced write
  visibly carries lease.valid=false), and single-vintage semantics are
  unchanged. First writes are NO LONGER unconditional: a missing file outside
  the lease stays missing (permanent-gap law), and an explicit --date naming an
  already-rolled session is refused without --force. Option A (moving the
  accrual earlier) was rejected: the
  accrual depends on the same-night membership rebuild immediately preceding it,
  the timing drift is queue-driven rather than schedule-driven, and an earlier slot
  would not fix the retry-path boundary.
rationale: >
  The same-ET-day predicate encoded a calendar coincidence, not the lawful boundary.
  The lawful boundary is the session-relative overnight window in which the vendor
  snapshot still carries the settled book — and rather than assuming that, the
  same-book proof measures it per replacement via OI agreement on shared contracts.
  Sol's warning that expected_last_session(now) == asof alone cannot exclude
  weekend/preopen stale tape was confirmed by census (it holds all weekend), hence
  the hard 03:00-next-day endpoint. The adversarial boundary pass held every
  DST/holiday/early-close/edge attack against this construction. Sol's amendment
  round (review 4989933857) then closed the residual first-write PIT hole — with
  no stored file the gate fell straight to decision=wrote, so a weekend run after
  a failed Friday capture (or a bare --date old-session) could stamp the CURRENT
  vendor book under an old session label — moved the refusal ahead of the vendor
  fetch (weekend runs must not burn the universe on a categorically forbidden
  write), and hardened the overlap floor from a de-facto 20-contract maximum
  into a real 25% floor.
alternatives:
  - option: Option A — move the accrual to a dedicated close-proximate execution point
    why_not: dependency-unsafe (same-night membership rebuild precedes it in-sequence), queue-driven drift persists regardless of schedule, and the retry-path boundary defect remains
  - option: expected_last_session(now) == asof alone as the lease
    why_not: holds all weekend for a Friday session and through Monday 16:59 ET — exactly the stale-recapture window it must exclude (Sol §3 anticipated this; census confirmed)
  - option: Wall-clock lease without the same-book proof
    why_not: the lease bounds plausibility but proves nothing about the book; the OI-intersection check converts the vintage claim into per-replacement evidence

Scope note (amended 2026-08-21, Sol review 4989933857): the lease governs EVERY
non-forced write — first writes included. A missing chain file outside the
lawful lease stays missing (the permanent-gap law), the refusal is evaluated
before any vendor fetch, and only --force overrides — with the forced receipt
visibly recording the out-of-lease state. This PR is held for Sol per the
AD-1C0.1 handoff; the decision takes effect on merge.
