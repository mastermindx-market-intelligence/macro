question: >
  After Sol accepted the W1B closed-bundle membership-subtraction amend and
  PR #6044 merged, what authority remains before Capital Structure V2 may
  advance beyond W1B?
answer: >
  W1B is accepted and merged, but it is not production-closed until the first
  natural scheduled collector -> Capital Structure chain containing the W1B
  merge completes and its receipt is reviewed. Do not dispatch a second daily
  run merely to accelerate proof. Until that natural receipt exists, keep W1B
  in_progress and W2 unauthorized. After a passing natural receipt, W2 becomes
  eligible only for a separate Sol commission; it does not auto-start.
rationale: >
  GitHub PR #6044 records Sol PASS of exact head
  3ba55c6d68778e29b6bf8b238a1cab39b5ada2f4 and releases the review hold for
  #6044 only. The PR then merged as
  ec388d963190fe149f1cdb4d0847136ec2eb3c38. Its own acceptance contract
  deliberately leaves one post-merge box open: the first natural collector ->
  Capital Structure chain containing W1B, with an explicit prohibition on a
  second daily dispatch. The direct Agent OS workstream still asks the already-
  answered CEO question, so reconciliation is required without manufacturing
  the remaining evidence.
alternatives:
  - option: Treat the #6044 merge as W1B completion and start W2 immediately
    why_not: >
      The accepted PR contract explicitly requires the first natural production
      chain after merge. Merge proves the implementation object, not the natural
      production path.
  - option: Dispatch another daily run now to obtain proof faster
    why_not: >
      The accepted W1B contract explicitly forbids a second daily dispatch.
      Manufactured proof would violate the very production sequencing being
      accepted.
  - option: Leave needs_ceo open until the natural run
    why_not: >
      Sol acceptance already occurred. Conflating the answered authority gate
      with the still-open production proof makes the canonical state false.

## Authority consequence

This record reconciles an already-exercised Sol decision. It grants no new
runtime authority. The only lawful W1B continuation is to observe the first
natural scheduled Capital Structure production chain on a descendant containing
#6044 and record the receipt. W2 remains closed until that proof passes and Sol
issues a separate bounded commission.
