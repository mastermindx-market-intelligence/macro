key: MARKET-OS-A1A-ACCEPTED-IN-PRODUCTION
question: >
  Has Market OS A1A — Portfolio Population Truth + State Authority — satisfied its
  frozen production acceptance law so that the wave may be marked done and A1B may
  become eligible for a separate bounded commission?
answer: >
  Yes. Sol accepts A1A in production. The final authenticated matrix proves that the
  Portfolio surface describes canonical Portfolio state across empty, one-position,
  all-unsized, mixed-sizing, degraded-last-good, and first-read-failure states without
  Watchlist population leakage, cloud-to-local substitution, silent sizing completion,
  fabricated relationship risk, or private-holdings leakage. Macro and Terminal agree
  on the canonical Portfolio, the sealed canonical fixture was restored exactly under
  the already-ratified semantic-v2 timestamp exception, and no controlled temporary
  row remains. Scene 9 was intentionally prohibited by the later specific production
  authorities and is not an A1A completion blocker. A1A is DONE. This ruling does not
  implement or automatically start A1B.
rationale: >
  The architecture freeze requires a real production state round-trip, not green CI.
  The final privacy-safe authenticated production matrix exercises the exact required
  scene and its negative states: true zero while four Watchlists remain populated;
  one canonical position; three unsized positions with explicit equal-assumption;
  mixed sizing with abstention; authenticated cloud failure after last-good; a fresh
  first-read failure with explicit unknown rather than false zero; continuous
  Macro-Terminal conformance; privacy inspection; exact temporary-row cleanup; and
  immediate plus delayed restoration reconciliation. The earlier restoration blocker
  was separately resolved by the accepted ruling that only server-generated
  created_at and updated_at are excluded from restoration equality; identity, owner,
  semantic fields, multiplicity, Watchlists, product agreement, and ordered row IDs
  remain exact. DEC:MARKET-OS-A1A-MERGED-PRODUCTION-ACCEPTANCE-REQUIRED broadly named
  account-transition production proof. Later, more specific Sol action-time authorities
  explicitly prohibited destructive sign-out/sign-in Scene 9 while retaining the
  underlying auth-generation protections and commissioning the rest of the authenticated
  matrix. Sol's final acceptance therefore supersedes that older decision for A1A's
  unfinished-gate status and, specifically, its account-transition clause for A1A
  completion. The older record remains historical evidence for the bounded repairs and
  proof boundary; merged #6160 auth-generation protections remain intact. No
  contradictory production evidence or higher authority surfaced in the final review.
alternatives:
  - option: Keep A1A in progress and repeat the authenticated matrix
    why_not: >
      The matrix already passed the frozen acceptance contract and the workstream
      explicitly forbids repeating it absent contradictory production evidence or a
      new Sol recommission. Repetition would add mutation risk without resolving a
      remaining falsifier.
  - option: Treat A1A as accepted but immediately start A1B in the same ruling
    why_not: >
      Acceptance and downstream implementation are distinct operations. A1B still
      requires a fresh collision census and one bounded commission against current
      Macro/Terminal truth.
  - option: Reopen Scene 9 as a hidden A1A completion gate
    why_not: >
      The later specific Sol authorities prohibited Scene 9 while preserving the
      auth-generation protections and explicitly defined the commissioned final matrix.
      Sol has now accepted that matrix. Treating the older broad clause as unfinished
      would contradict the specific production scope and final ruling.

## Capability delta

Before A1A, an authenticated Portfolio surface could blur canonical positions with Watchlist or temporary state, fail open from cloud authority to local state, silently complete mixed sizing, or show population/risk claims that were not trustworthy across failure modes.

After A1A, the production Portfolio authority seam has been proven across the frozen positive and negative matrix. The user-facing Portfolio can truthfully represent canonical positions, explicit empty/one/many state, bounded weighting assumptions, abstention, degraded last-good, and unknown first-read failure while preserving Watchlist separation and Macro-Terminal conformance.

## What this ruling does not make true

- A1B Fast Start Import is not built or commissioned by this decision.
- A2-A6, B1-B6, C1-C6, D1-D9, E1-E3, and F0-F5 remain separate waves.
- There is still no authenticated offline Portfolio outbox; failed authenticated writes must not claim local retention.
- `created_at` and `updated_at` remain server-generated metadata and are excluded only from the accepted A1A restoration-equality comparison.
- Scene 9 was not executed. Its older account-transition clause is superseded for A1A completion; any future identity-transition production test requires separate authority and is not reopened as A1A debt.
- RCTX-1 is an independent Market OS research-context subwave and is not A1A completion evidence.

## Continuation law

The next primary Market OS action is a fresh Sol commission for A1B only after current Macro main, protected Terminal master, open PRs/worktrees, the generated Active Build Map, and exact candidate paths are re-censused. A1B must implement reviewed paste/import to canonical `portfolio_positions` with stable identity, atomic/idempotent persistence, lost-response safety, and Macro-Terminal conformance. Do not broaden the commission into A2-A6 or a My Market rewrite.
