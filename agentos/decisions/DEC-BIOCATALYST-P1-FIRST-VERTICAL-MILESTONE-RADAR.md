key: BIOCATALYST-P1-FIRST-VERTICAL-MILESTONE-RADAR
question: >
  Which post-P0 BioCatalyst vertical ships first: Catalyst Radar —
  Regulatory/PDUFA (Sol's prior), Catalyst Radar — Trial Milestones (registry
  milestone dates with revision lineage), Company/Asset Dossier, or biotech
  Market Pulse? And may the existing milestone monitor — whose docstring says
  it is "deliberately not a catalyst calendar" — be graduated into a Catalyst
  Radar surface?
answer: >
  SOL-RATIFIED (P1-0R authority closure, 2026-08-20). Canonical ruling:
  Catalyst Radar — Trial Milestones ships before Regulatory/PDUFA. The larger
  "Catalyst Radar" is the product container; the first lane is explicitly
  Trial Milestones — registry schedule facts. Public wording must use "Trial
  milestone", "Primary completion", "Study completion", and "days to
  milestone"; it must NOT label a registry completion date a "readout", a
  "catalyst date", or a market event. The source supplies registry
  primary/overall completion dates (often ESTIMATED, sponsor-submitted),
  which are not sponsor topline-readout announcements — a true
  readout/announcement calendar remains a future cross-plane capability. The
  graduation of the milestone monitor into a Catalyst Radar lane is a named
  boundary evolution: the no-signal discipline is preserved (no
  approval/outcome/market-signal claim; rows are registry schedule facts with
  provenance), while the dates are presented as watchable events under the
  spine identity whose second tenant is Regulatory/PDUFA. Sol's PDUFA-first
  prior is revised on readiness evidence (Sol commissioned exactly this
  falsification test and has now accepted its result).
rationale: >
  Current-head archaeology (P1-0 census + opus red-team, 2026-08-20):
  prospective PDUFA has no lawful source at current head — pdufa_date is a
  forbidden claim on Drugs@FDA per the RECON-0 freeze, forward PDUFA is
  issuer-disclosure truth owned by the corporate plane (SEC ingest is
  unavailable_to_biocatalyst by registry law), Drugs@FDA is
  production_ingest_allowed false with rights review owed, and the BPC JV
  snapshot is post-soak + SNAPSHOT-ONBOARD gated. The steelman for the prior
  (gates are decisions, soak ends in 6 days) fails because the gates PDUFA
  needs are unopenable by any BioCatalyst act: even same-day rulings yield a
  retrospective approvals spine, not forward PDUFA dates — the missing
  artifact is a cross-plane disclosure-evidence contract that does not exist
  in any form, duration unknown. Trial Milestones runs on the registry's two
  production-allowed sources: clinicaltrials_gov_v2 (the only launch-critical
  one; live generation ctgov_run_20260820T120032611932Z) and
  clinicaltrials_gov_record_history (full contiguous registry version history
  0..N per NCT, 100% cohort coverage — the revision-lineage differentiator).
  Zero-row risk was falsified with real registry data: next_180d yields 1 row
  and next_365d yields 3 rows on the current 4-NCT cohort (NCT06602479 primary
  completion 2026-12-18 Est.; two study completions May 2027); the P0 empty
  state was the next_90d + primary-completion-only default cut. The first
  slice mutates nothing on the frozen soak surface.
alternatives:
  - option: Catalyst Radar — Regulatory/PDUFA first (Sol's prior)
    why_not: >
      Worst end-to-end readiness of the four: blocked on a cross-plane
      issuer-disclosure source contract that does not exist in any form
      (duration unknown), plus Drugs@FDA rights review and the post-soak
      successor-registry transition. Becomes the spine's second tenant instead
      (prospective PDUFA truth ownership frozen in
      DEC:BIOCATALYST-PDUFA-TRUTH-IS-CORPORATE-DISCLOSURE-PLANE).
  - option: Keep the milestone monitor's "not a catalyst calendar" boundary
      and ship the radar as a plain calendar upgrade without catalyst framing
    why_not: >
      Was preserved as Sol's veto option; Sol did not exercise the veto. The
      catalyst-event spine (source-native event identity, revision lineage,
      evidence drill-down) is the reusable architecture the program needs for
      every later tenant; shipping it without the spine identity would rebuild
      the same surface twice. The no-signal discipline the boundary protects
      is kept either way, and the public-wording law above keeps registry
      schedule facts from masquerading as market events.
  - option: Company/Asset Dossier first
    why_not: >
      A join surface whose inputs (catalysts, pipelines, cash/runway, asset
      identity) do not exist yet; inverts the dependency order.
  - option: Biotech Market Pulse first
    why_not: >
      Explicitly ruled out by the commissioning directive as a convenience
      pick; unlocks no event/evidence spine.

## Grounds

Provenance is preserved deliberately: Fable (COO seat) performed the P1-0
repo archaeology and adjudication under Sol's directive, and an opus red-team
attacked the verdict before it was returned (verdict: UPHOLD WITH REQUIRED
CORRECTIONS — all corrections applied, including the milestone-not-readout
rename, the named boundary evolution, and the real-data zero-row
falsification). Sol's original directive commissioned this adjudication with
an explicit falsification clause: "Do not accept that prior blindly. Falsify
it if current-main archaeology proves another vertical has materially better
end-to-end readiness without shrinking the product." The archaeology did
exactly that, and Sol ratified the revision in the P1-0R authority closure
(2026-08-20) with amendments: the larger Catalyst Radar is the product
container, the first lane is explicitly Trial Milestones / registry schedule
facts, and the public wording law in the answer is binding. The product is
not shrunk: the catalyst-event spine (source-native event identity, scheduled
date + precision + registry date type, known_at, revision lineage with exact
trial status preserved, issuer resolution with typed unresolved states,
evidence drill-down) is designed regulatory-tenant-ready from day one; PDUFA
rides the same spine the moment its source plane unlocks.

## What would reopen this

A lawful prospective-PDUFA source materializing before P1-1 lands (e.g., an
early corporate-plane disclosure-evidence contract per
DEC:BIOCATALYST-PDUFA-TRUTH-IS-CORPORATE-DISCLOSURE-PLANE), which would let
the PDUFA tenant start in parallel rather than second; or the post-soak
successor transition landing with SNAPSHOT-ONBOARD commissioned ahead of
P1-1. The ratification itself is settled; reopening it requires a new Sol
ruling, not a session's judgment.
