question: >
  After reconciling stale Eval OS records against current Agent OS, GitHub, Linear, Slack,
  qledger production evidence and the current Personal-Pro Executive transport state, what is
  the one completion architecture and which prior unresolveds are actually still unresolved?
answer: >
  Preserve the original thin joining-layer architecture: T1 is the only engine registry;
  qledger and owner-native ledgers remain the canonical scored-record substrates; existing
  gauntlet/species/qual-ladder owners remain promotion authority; T4 is a pure derived health
  view over T1+Synapse+existing evidence providers; T7/T8 extend the existing read-only admin
  Intelligence OS surface; T12 may derive a required evidence tier but Agent OS remains the
  router. No second engine registry, score store, health monitor/store, promotion service,
  clock database, Prophet evaluation ledger, replay framework, contradiction detector, rubric
  or work queue may be created. Reconcile the stale control-leg blocker as RESOLVED by P0d:
  benchmark is universal baseline; matched control is required only for governed families with
  a defensible counterfactual (currently stock_desk and demand_chain), while thematic_desk is
  benchmark-only. The critical first gaps are real stock/thematic forward clock starts, stock
  matched-control clock start/current demand control-clock host verification, T4 deployed proof,
  unified promotion/clock-laundering adversarial acceptance and T7/T8. The complete program also
  retains explicit T0-T12 closure obligations: T2 Prophet benchmark/MFE/MAE is not built under
  the old contract, T5 taxonomy is not built, T6 has only one pre-existing benchmark case,
  T3/T9 remain partial, and T10/T11/T12 remain unbuilt unless a current canonical owner is
  explicitly proven to satisfy/supersede the old capability.
rationale: >
  Current main proves substantial substrate landed after the 2026-08-14 handoffs: T1 was later
  reconciled done; #5534/#5577/#5584 already merged; P0d/#5609 and #5665/#5672 resolved control
  law; T4 merged as #5721 after adversarial repair; qledger is actively grading real claims.
  But only demand_chain has a tracked general forward evidence-clock start, its historical
  runner control-clock receipt is the only proved matched-control clock, metric-validity is
  still warn-tier by default, T4 lacks accepted production-browser proof, T7/T8/T12 remain
  plan-only, current prophet.ledger/v1 lacks the old T2 benchmark/excess/MFE/MAE fields, the T5
  failure vocabulary is spec-only, and no 20-case golden library exists. Calling the program
  complete would therefore confuse merged infrastructure and neighboring programs with governed
  real use. The freeze keeps one canonical system, makes natural-time measurement/health proof
  first, and requires every original T0-T12 capability to receive an explicit terminal evidence
  disposition rather than disappear by architectural drift.
alternatives:
  - option: resume the old W4/W5/T4 branch next-actions literally
    why_not: >
      They are stale. The named PRs merged, the old T4 branch is gone, T4 merged through #5721,
      and the control policy received a later explicit CEO ruling and implementation.
  - option: create a new Eval OS score/health/promotion database to unify everything
    why_not: >
      This would be the seventh evaluation/control plane the original architecture explicitly
      forbids and would duplicate qledger, T1, T4 and existing promotion owners.
  - option: blindly implement the old T2/T5/T6 file lists now
    why_not: >
      Prophet, Metabolism and Neural-Web architectures evolved after the plan. The original
      capability remains owed, but current owner archaeology must determine whether to extend a
      newer canonical owner or record an evidence-backed replacement; old implementation shape
      has no authority to create a parallel ledger/replay/taxonomy plane.
  - option: mark the program done because current qledger is actively grading and T4 merged
    why_not: >
      Real focal desk clocks are incomplete, T4 is not production-proven, illegal-promotion
      acceptance is not unified, the L4 human answer layer is not built, and multiple original
      T0-T12 capabilities remain partial or not built.
