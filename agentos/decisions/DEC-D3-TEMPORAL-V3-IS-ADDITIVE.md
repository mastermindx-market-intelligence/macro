key: D3-TEMPORAL-V3-IS-ADDITIVE
question: >
  Sol's D3 directive names "temporal event v3". Does that require re-minting the
  event contract (government_procurement_event.v2 -> v3), or freezing v3 temporal
  semantics additively on top of the existing contract?
answer: >
  Additive. The event contract string stays government_procurement_event.v2; the
  procurement workspace gains a temporal_contract:
  "government_procurement_temporal.v3" marker plus typed per-rail failure_state
  fields (null | source_unavailable | projection_missing) and a new
  freshness.budget rail block. No event field is added, renamed, or retimed, and
  no source_published_at clock is ever minted — the UI carries the source
  publication clock as a NAMED NULL.
rationale: >
  The D3 archaeology (2026-08-20, main 70b695e882e0) proved the v2 event corpus
  already carries everything the Change Tape needs for temporal truth: distinct
  effective_at/known_at/first_seen_at/last_seen_at, typed award_change.event_type,
  receipt-bound changed_fields[].before/.after, is_late_discovery, and
  prior_source_identity. The misreads were render-side (single winning clock on
  the tape row, frontend-computed failure states, and a module-absent budget
  path stuck on "loading" forever — the REAL budget module already emitted
  projection_missing from the live HTTP receipt, and D3 preserves that verdict
  as authoritative per the PR #6048 adversarial review). A contract bump would
  ripple through every validator and consumer for zero informational gain.
alternatives: >
  (1) Bump to government_procurement_event.v3 — rejected: churn without new
  information; breaks HAS_WORKSPACE-style consumers for no user-visible truth
  gain. (2) Mint source_published_at — rejected outright: USAspending exposes no
  per-revision publication time; substituting any other clock would assert a
  falsehood (frozen spec §1).

A later wave may still mint a real event v3; this record only forbids treating
"temporal v3" as requiring one today.
