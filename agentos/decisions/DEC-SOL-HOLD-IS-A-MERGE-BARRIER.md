key: SOL-HOLD-IS-A-MERGE-BARRIER
question: >
  Two same-day incidents (PR #5953, PR #5974, both 2026-08-19) saw PRs carrying an
  explicit CEO/Sol hold ("do NOT merge / held for Sol adversarial review") merged
  anyway by shared automation paths. Is a recorded hold binding on every merge path,
  and does conditional merge authority granted for one PR extend to any other?
answer: >
  A Sol/CEO/operator STOP or HOLD-FOR-SOL recorded on a specific PR (body or comment)
  is a MERGE BARRIER binding EVERY merge path — the merge-on-green sweeper, any
  blanket-arming session, and manual `gh pr merge` alike — regardless of label state.
  Enforcement is state, not intent: a held PR must carry no `merge-on-green` label,
  have `autoMergeRequest` null, be converted to DRAFT, and carry a hold comment naming
  the authority and the release condition (ratifying the
  DSC:CHINA-ALPHA-HOLD-MERGE-INCIDENT protocol into the decision plane). A session
  arming any PR it did not open must first grep its title+body+comments for hold
  language. Once that protocol is complete, the exact head is pushed and clean, and
  all binding checks on that head have concluded green, the delivery state is
  **PARKED / HOLD-FOR-SOL**: it is terminal for the current ship/merge attempt, not
  SHIPPED and not a retryable `SHIP LOOP BLOCKED` state. Report the evidence once and
  stop shipping; do not poll, re-arm, mark ready, merge, or re-enter the ship loop
  until the named holding authority changes or releases the hold. That terminality is
  scoped to the ship attempt, not to the worker: the reciprocal worker/Sol child
  dialogue remains nonterminal, the same child, carrier, branch and PR resume on a
  same-carrier Sol CONTINUE or REQUEST_REPAIR, and only an explicit same-carrier Sol
  STOP closes the child (`DEC:HOLD-PARKS-SHIP-NOT-DIALOGUE`). Conditional merge authority granted
  for one PR (e.g. Sol's #5872 finalization conditions) NEVER transfers to a sibling
  or successor PR — each PR's merge authority is granted individually or not at all.
rationale: >
  Label-based holds do not bind the merge path: the sweeper selects candidates by
  label only, blanket-arming sessions have twice overridden deliberate review freezes
  (4 of 6 armed 08-19 carried explicit holds), and #5974 merged 16:04Z against an
  explicit body hold while unarmed. The hold must therefore live in the states the
  merge paths actually consult (label absence, draft status, auto-merge state) AND be
  a named prohibition on the actors that bypass them. The non-transfer clause exists
  because #5974's merge followed immediately after #5872's authorized merge — adjacent
  authority is exactly the momentum a barrier must stop. The PARKED terminal state
  closes the opposite failure mode: after the barrier is correctly installed, an
  agent must not spend repeated turns waiting for a merge that the same decision
  forbids it to perform.
alternatives:
  - option: Keep the DSC protocol as a standing mitigation without a decision record
    why_not: the DSC self-flags as provisional ("until a stronger control ships"); Sol ordered the rule made durable in the decision plane after the second incident
  - option: Build a hook-enforced hold label before recording the rule
    why_not: the enforcement wave is separate reviewed work; the governing rule must bind sessions now, not after a build
  - option: Treat merge authority as session-scoped (one grant covers the session's PRs)
    why_not: that is the failure mode observed — authority bleed from an authorized PR onto a held sibling

Scope note: this record governs merge AUTHORITY and the terminal session classification
created by that authority. It does not change when an ordinary merge is technically
clean (DEC:MERGE-ON-CONCLUDED-CHECKS-ONLY) or the sweeper's normal handoff contract
(DEC:DEFAULT-FINISH-HANDS-WAIT-TO-SWEEPER). A held PR is outside both until the holding
authority releases it. PARKED is not evidence of deployment or live verification and
must never be reported as SHIPPED. A future hook-enforced hold label supersedes the
procedural protocol here when it ships through its own reviewed wave.
