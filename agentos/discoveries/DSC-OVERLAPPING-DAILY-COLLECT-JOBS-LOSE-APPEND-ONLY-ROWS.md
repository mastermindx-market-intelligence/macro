key: OVERLAPPING-DAILY-COLLECT-JOBS-LOSE-APPEND-ONLY-ROWS
claim: >
  Two `daily.yml` runs whose `collect` jobs OVERLAP each compute the USAspending
  append-only artifacts from the base each checked out, and the later push replaces
  the earlier one's rows wholesale — a lost update, not a merge. Measured 2026-08-18:
  the EDT cron run 32077948964 collected 01:07:12Z→04:08:26Z and committed 59ccb9c774c8
  at 04:01:49Z; the workflow_dispatch run 32084697588 collected 01:27:00Z→04:28:57Z off
  a base ~2.5h older than that commit and committed 93ab221b81dd at 04:21:53Z. Run B's
  push dropped run A's 16 newly appended `award_event_snapshots.parquet` rows and
  substituted its own 16 with the same `event_state_sha256` but its own `known_at`
  (01:37:55.262200Z → 01:55:22.848864Z) and `source_receipt_id`, and dropped run A's
  376 `collection_receipts.jsonl` lines for its own 376 — so `collection_receipts.jsonl`
  on main is no longer a prefix-extension of its predecessor, which is a contract the
  repo's own test asserts (tests/test_usaspending_awards.py:1817
  `assert second_bytes.startswith(first_bytes)`). The two runs cannot supersede each
  other by design: `.github/workflows/daily.yml:65` puts each cron and each manual
  dispatch in its OWN concurrency group, deliberately, so the DST pair cannot kill each
  other's slot.
falsifier: >
  Exhibit a single collector run emitting BOTH receipt run-ids
  `usaspending-97b25ea228b65919c41eab1a` and `usaspending-643af6aaa406bdd6db068f65`, or
  a code path that mutates `known_at` on an existing snapshot row (there is none:
  `_append_event_versions` SKIPS a re-observation whose state hash is unchanged,
  collectors/usaspending_awards.py:1915-1916, and retains prior rows verbatim at
  :1888-1899). Or show the two `collect` jobs did not overlap:
  `gh run view 32077948964 --json jobs --jq '[.jobs[]|select(.name=="collect")]'` and
  the same for 32084697588. Or show `collection_receipts.jsonl` at 93ab221b81dd still
  starts with its 59ccb9c774c8 bytes.
so_what: >
  A hand `gh workflow run daily.yml` while another daily run is queued or in progress
  does not merely waste a runner — it can CORRUPT append-only evidence, silently.
  The existing rule ("never dispatch while a daily.yml run is queued or in progress",
  CLAUDE.md §Recovery etiquette) now has a measured corruption receipt, not just a
  compute-waste rationale. Preflight
  `gh run list --workflow daily.yml --json status --jq '[.[]|select(.status!="completed")]'`
  and do not dispatch over a live run. Second: when a govrev candidate red reports
  "first-seen candidates with neither a ledger issuance nor a reviewed historical
  suppression", check whether the SAME (candidate_family, issuer_company_id, award-ref,
  effective_at) tuples also appear as ORPHANED ledger rows before believing new award
  records arrived — 26 unaccounted paired 1:1 with 26 orphans over 18 tuples here, which
  means re-identification, not discovery. Third: every write-path check in
  collectors/usaspending_awards.py (torn-generation refusal :3956-3972, staged-replay
  binding :4030-4044) compares the run's state to the ledgers on the run's OWN disk, so a
  run whose entire base is stale is internally consistent and passes all of them; the
  missing check is base-freshness against origin/main at push time — and the mechanism that
  actually discards the rows is `git pull --rebase --autostash -X theirs origin main`
  (.github/workflows/daily.yml:702, :751, :772, :1313): during a rebase the replayed commit
  is "theirs", so two runs appending different tails to an append-only file always conflict
  and the later run wins WHOLESALE, silently. `.gitattributes` already solves this class 24
  times (20 `merge=union` + 4 `-merge`) but carries NO entry for `data/government_revenue/` —
  and `merge=union` is DECLINED there, not merely missing: see the detail section, the
  ledger's byte-prefix hash binding makes it actively wrong. That base-freshness check is
  now SHIPPED as `scripts/ci/append_only_base_fence.py` + `config/append_only_artifacts.json`,
  called from every publishing lane's retry loop via `push_append_only_fence`
  (DEC:APPEND-ONLY-BASE-FRESHNESS-IS-A-PUSH-PATH-FENCE, PR #5885).
  Fourth: do NOT wait
  this class of red out. Measured — the projection lane returns `status: ok`,
  `append_count: 0` against the corrupted tree because it reads the committed
  `latest.json`, not the spine the failing test rebuilds. The repair is to REVERT the
  losing collector run's whole generation — and to scope that revert by what
  `build_payload()` reads (`data/government_revenue/` AND `data/usaspending/`), not by the
  directory the symptom names; a partial revert fails closed and looks like an
  unrepairable wedge. Shipped as #5870; see the detail section.

## Detail

Three plausible stories were tested and two are wrong.

**Not "a nightly advanced the candidate set without the review/issuance step".** The
issuance step ran: 5214d0b20a17 (`govrev: SAM opportunity evidence 2026-08-18T04:15Z`)
appended 26 rows to `candidate_ledger.jsonl` with `candidate_projection_status`
`status: ok`. Those 26 are precisely the rows that are now orphaned.

**Not "26 new award records arrived".** No award records arrived at all between the two
collection commits: `award_event_snapshots.parquet` stayed at 210 rows and every
semantic column — including `event_state_sha256` — is byte-identical. Only the
observation stamps moved. `agentos/discoveries/DSC-NIGHTLY-LANE-ORDER-DECIDES-LEDGER-COMPLETENESS.md`
(PR #5869, open at the time of writing) attributes the red to "new award records" and to
a five-minute lane-ordering overlap. The ordering observation is real and its
operational prescription — do not hand-issue the missing ledger rows — is correct and
is followed here. The causal attribution is not: a lane-ordering race between a
projection and a *legitimate* collection would leave the earlier ledger rows valid,
because `candidate_id` would not move. What moved `candidate_id` was a second collector
run overwriting the first's rows.

**Not a `known_at` semantics defect.** `known_at` means "the instant of the poll that
first recorded THIS state version" — it is excluded from `AWARD_EVENT_SNAPSHOT_STATE_FIELDS`
(collectors/usaspending_awards.py:302-320), the state hash docstring reads "Hash only
semantic direct-source state, never a receipt or retrieval clock"
(collectors/usaspending_awards.py:857-860), and an identical re-observation is skipped
rather than re-stamped (:1915-1916). Pinning `known_at` per `(award_key, state_hash)` to
first-observation would be actively wrong: for `A→B→A→B`, the fourth row's event carries
an award_key, source_rail, state_hash, event_type and changed_fields tuple identical to
the second row's, so the two would collide into one `event_id` and `_merge`
(engine/government_revenue/award_events.py:1789) would collapse a real transition out of
existence. `known_at` in the `_event_id` seed is load-bearing and must stay.

### Why every existing guard passed

The collector's write path is careful and all of it is scoped to one process's disk: the
torn-generation refusal (:3956-3972) compares the on-disk state binding to the on-disk
ledgers, and the staged-replay check (:4030-4044) proves the bytes a reader will load
reproduce the generation this run computed. Both are satisfied by a run whose base is
stale, because such a run is perfectly self-consistent — it simply does not know that a
newer generation exists. Nothing in the write path, and nothing in the push retry, asks
whether `origin/main` moved under an append-only artifact between checkout and push.

### What clears the CI red — NOT the projection lane; a generation revert (RESOLVED)

An earlier revision of this record said the govrev projection lane would issue the 26
forward and green the test. That was reasoning, not measurement, and **it is wrong.**

Run the projection against the committed tree in a sandbox root:

```
cp -R data/government_revenue $SB/data/ ; cp -R config/government_revenue $SB/config/ ; cp -R contracts $SB/
python3 -m scripts.build_government_revenue_candidates --root $SB --generated-at 2026-08-18T08:00:00+00:00
```

It returns `"status":"ok"`, `"append_count":0`, `"candidate_count":48`, ledger unchanged at
56 lines and the SAME `queue_content_id` `grcq1-d7948adf2acbf728e9e48270`. The lane is a
stable no-op. Waiting for it — whether the queued
`government_revenue_projection / refresh` job or a 30-minute scheduled tick — does not
clear this red and never will.

**Why: the projection and the failing test read different sources.**
`validate_candidate_projection_inputs`
(scripts/build_government_revenue_candidates.py:319-372) loads the committed canonical
`data/government_revenue/latest.json` + `workspace.json`, which were published at 04:15Z
off run A's spine and therefore still carry run A's identities. The failing test calls
`build_payload(root=ROOT)` (tests/test_government_revenue_candidates.py:23), which
rebuilds the payload live from the parquet spine that run B clobbered. Measured:
committed `latest.json` `known_at` = `2026-08-18T02:42:13.240485+00:00`; a rebuild from
the current spine yields `2026-08-18T01:55:22.848864+00:00`. **The published govrev
surface and the spine it is supposed to derive from have diverged, and this test is the
only reader that sees it.**

**And the 26 cannot be issued forward even once `latest.json` is rebuilt.** All 26 carry
`known_at` `2026-08-18T01:55:22.848864+00:00`; the frozen anti-backfill clock
`prior_frozen_at` is the prior state's `generated_at` =
`2026-08-18T04:17:31.654847+00:00`. Since `known_at <= prior_frozen_at` for all 26, and
0 of their 26 stable keys are in the ledger's `issued_source_keys` and none match the
8-entry suppression manifest, `_match_historical_suppressions`
(scripts/build_government_revenue_candidates.py:993-1004) routes every one of them to
`unknown_historical_ids` and raises `"new candidate observation is not forward of the
prior frozen generated_at clock"`. So the next rebuild of `latest.json` converts this
silent red into a hard projection-lane failure.

**Neither reviewed manifest fits them.** `candidate_issuance_corrections.v1.json` is
`policy: exact_issued_source_identity_only` / `decision:
quarantine_erroneous_historical_issuance` and every entry carries `issued_generated_at`
and `issued_row_sha256` — it quarantines rows that ARE in the ledger and were issued in
error. These 26 were never issued. The historical-suppression manifest is held in exact
bijection with that same 8-identity cohort by the failing test itself.

### RESOLVED — a generation revert IS the repair, and it shipped

An earlier revision of this section concluded "no file-level revert restores coherence,
therefore ci-pack-6 is WEDGED pending an operator decision". **That was wrong**, and the
error is instructive. PR #5870 (`fix(govrev): restore the collection generation the
candidate projection was frozen against`, merged 2026-08-18T07:38:11Z) reverted run B's
write and the red cleared. Verified at main `fc9d58195e16`:
`python3 -m pytest tests/test_government_revenue_candidates.py -q` → **39 passed**.

**Why the sandbox revert failed and the real one worked: the payload spans two data
directories.** The experiment reverted all 25 changed `data/government_revenue/`
artifacts and stopped there, leaving `data/usaspending/_meta.json`,
`data/usaspending/grants_loans.parquet` and `data/usaspending/obligations.parquet` on
run B's generation — a mixed generation, which is why the rebuild still showed 26
unaccounted. #5870 reverted all 18 of the files that actually moved, across BOTH trees.
So the lesson is not "reverts don't work"; it is **scope the revert by what the payload
reads, not by the directory the symptom points at** — `build_payload()` composes
`data/government_revenue/` AND `data/usaspending/`, and a partial revert fails closed in
a way that looks exactly like an unrepairable wedge.

The rest of this section stands and is the reason the repair had to be a generation
revert rather than a wait or a manifest edit:

- The projection lane is a **stable no-op** against a corrupted tree (measured above):
  it reads the committed `latest.json`, not the spine. Waiting never clears this class.
- The 26 could not have been issued forward: `known_at` `01:55:22.848864Z` sits behind
  the frozen anti-backfill clock `04:17:31.654847Z`, so
  `_match_historical_suppressions` (scripts/build_government_revenue_candidates.py:993-1004)
  would have raised.
- Neither reviewed manifest fits them:
  `candidate_issuance_corrections.v1.json` is `policy: exact_issued_source_identity_only`
  and every entry carries `issued_row_sha256` — it quarantines rows already in the
  ledger. These were never issued.

Do not hand-write ledger rows, allowlist ids, or silence the guard. The guard is correct
and was reporting a real divergence. The repair for this class is: **revert the losing
collector run's whole generation, across every tree the canonical payload reads.**

### Corrections from two sibling lanes (2026-08-18, verified here)

**This was NOT the first occurrence, and the blast radius was five artifacts, not two.**
Both corrections come from `claude/append-only-base-fence` (PR #5885) and are re-verified
in this checkout.

- **Prior silent occurrence, 2026-08-07.** `1fc6d1181e4c -> 08ad4d836d6a`:
  `collection_receipts.jsonl` went 720 -> 720 lines with **360 receipt ids dropped and 360
  substituted**, and is not a prefix-extension of its predecessor. Re-verified here by
  reading both blobs and diffing the line sets. It went unnoticed because that night's swap
  did not happen to move a `candidate_id` anything had already issued against. Two
  occurrences in sixteen transitions — 2026-08-18 is simply the first time the loss was
  loud. Any claim in this record that reads as "first occurrence" is superseded by this.
- **Five artifacts lost rows, not two:** `collection_receipts.jsonl` −376,
  `subaward_collection_receipts.jsonl` −192, `idv_collection_receipts.jsonl` −26,
  `award_event_snapshots.parquet` 16 of 210 identities, and
  **`award_action_versions.parquet` 18 of 35,257** — the last had not been named anywhere,
  including in the first revision of this record.

**The resolver has a name: `-X theirs`.** From
`claude/govrev-event-identity-adjudication` (PR #5882), verified here:
`.github/workflows/daily.yml:702` — and :751, :772, :1313 — push via
`git pull --rebase --autostash -X theirs origin main`. During a rebase the replayed commit
is "theirs", so two runs appending different tails to an append-only file always conflict
and the later run wins **wholesale, with no conflict reported**. Base-freshness at push
time (this record's original framing) is the right refusal, but `-X theirs` is what
actually performs the discard on every retry that proceeds.

**`merge=union` looks like the cheap fix here. It is not — it is DECLINED.**
`.gitattributes` does solve this class 24 times elsewhere (20 `merge=union` + 4 `-merge`)
and carries **no entry for `data/government_revenue/`** (`git check-attr merge -- <path>`
returns `unspecified` for `collection_receipts.jsonl`, `candidate_ledger.jsonl` and
`award_event_snapshots.parquet`), so the instinct to add it is natural and wrong. Three
blockers, increasing in severity — recorded so the next session with the same good
instinct finds the answer instead of shipping it:

1. **It cannot cover the parquet spine at all.** A union merge of two binary frames is
   garbage. `award_event_snapshots.parquet` and `award_action_versions.parquet` are exactly
   what moved `candidate_id` in this incident (16 of 210 and 18 of 35,257 identities), so
   the exposure that caused the red survives untouched.
2. **It is actively WRONG for `candidate_ledger.jsonl`.** `candidate_projection_state.json`
   binds that ledger by `prior_sha256` over an exact byte prefix —
   scripts/build_government_revenue_candidates.py:540-542 hashes
   `ledger.raw[:prior_byte_count]` and raises `"candidate ledger prior prefix does not match
   projection state"` on mismatch (verified by reading it here). A union-merged tail no
   longer reproduces that hash, so union would convert a silent lost update into a hard
   projection-lane failure.
3. **Partial application is the worst of the three.** Even where union WOULD work — the
   three receipt ledgers — applying it there while the parquets stay unmerged yields
   receipts from both runs against a spine from one: precisely the mixed generation the
   collector's own torn-generation refusal (collectors/usaspending_awards.py:3956-3972)
   exists to prevent.

The distinction from the 20 existing entries is the durable lesson. Every one of those
(`data/qledger/claims.jsonl`, `data/trial_ledger.jsonl`, `data/neuralweb/causal_*.jsonl`,
`data/marketing/outbox/*.jsonl`) is a **standalone ledger with no cross-artifact hash
binding**. `data/government_revenue/` is **ONE hash-bound generation**, so the unit of
correctness is the FAMILY, not the file — which is why the repair (#5870) had to revert
every moved file across both trees, and why the push-path fence withholds the whole
coherence family rather than reverting the offending file. Full reasoning:
`DEC:APPEND-ONLY-BASE-FRESHNESS-IS-A-PUSH-PATH-FENCE`.

**Do not over-generalize that refutation.** The rule is not "`merge=union` is unsafe"; it is
**union is correct for a standalone ledger and wrong for a hash-bound family**. The 20
existing entries are right where they are. The test to apply before proposing a merge driver
anywhere: *does any consumer hash this file's bytes, or bind it to a sibling artifact?* If
no — union. If yes — a driver that rewrites the byte stream breaks the binding, and the
remedy is a push-path fence over the whole family instead.

That cuts the other way too, and is an open exposure rather than a finding: the `-X theirs`
push sites (daily.yml:702, :751, :772, :1313) are shared by every lane, so any append-only
artifact written by two overlapping runs is exposed to the same silent wholesale loss — and
for the standalone ledgers that already carry `merge=union`, git resolves it correctly, while
any append-only artifact carrying NEITHER union nor fence coverage does not. Whether that has
actually cost rows outside `data/government_revenue/` is unmeasured here. The cheap check, for
whoever picks it up: for each append-only artifact lacking a `.gitattributes` entry, walk its
commits and assert each version is a byte-prefix extension of its predecessor — the same test
that surfaced both govrev occurrences.

**The source published nothing in the window.** All 376 differing rows of
`collection_receipts.jsonl` between the two commits carry identical `request_sha256` AND
`response_sha256`, identical `record_count` and `has_next`, across 168 award keys and 21
tickers. Only `run_id`, `observed_at` and `receipt_id` moved. The 15 rail reclassifications
are pure re-derivation, definitively not a source correction.

Owning lanes: #5885 (artifact-layer base-freshness fence, push path), #5880 (scheduler-level
single-nightly mutex in `et_gate`), #5882 (adjudication: keep the `known_at` fold, no
supersession on `candidate_ledger.jsonl`, arm `GOVREV_CANDIDATE_PROOF_FATAL`).

### Residue this leaves on main

The 26 ledger rows issued at 04:10:06Z are permanently orphaned — real issuances whose
`candidate_id`s no longer rebuild from source, so `/candidate/{id}/history` for them is
stranded. Run A's 376 collection receipts are gone. `collection_receipts.jsonl` on main
is not a prefix-extension of its own predecessor. None of that is repairable by a
session and none of it is what the failing test is reporting; the test is reporting the
26 replacements, and issuing those forward is the correct disposition.

## Update 2026-08-18 — measured again by the fence, and it is wider and older

Building the base-freshness fence produced two corrections to the record above, both from
running the fence's verdicts over real history rather than over the two artifacts the
first pass happened to diff.

**The blast radius was five artifacts, not two.** 59ccb9c774c8 -> 93ab221b81dd, per
member:

| artifact | dropped |
|---|---|
| `collection_receipts.jsonl` | 376 lines |
| `subaward_collection_receipts.jsonl` | 192 lines |
| `idv_collection_receipts.jsonl` | 26 lines |
| `award_event_snapshots.parquet` | 16 of 210 identities |
| `award_action_versions.parquet` | 18 of 35257 identities |

`award_action_versions.parquet` had not been named anywhere. It is the second half of the
generation the projection state binds by hash, so its 18 re-stamped rows are part of the
same entanglement, not a separate defect.

**It had happened before.** 2026-08-07, 1fc6d1181e4c -> 08ad4d836d6a: `collection_receipts.jsonl`
720 -> 720 lines with **360 receipt ids dropped and 360 substituted** — the two halves
swapped wholesale, identical byte count, no growth — plus 192 subaward and 26 idv receipts.
Nothing noticed, because that night's swap did not happen to move a `candidate_id` that
anything downstream had already issued against. The 2026-08-18 event is therefore not a
freak: it is the first time this class of loss happened to be LOUD. Two occurrences in
sixteen transitions of these files.

Control, for the falsifier: c52b647d499f -> 59ccb9c774c8, a legitimate nightly transition,
is clean on all eight registered members (194 -> 210 event identities, 35239 -> 35257
action identities, receipts strictly extended). The check does not fire on ordinary
growth.

Reproduction of both, and of the fenced counterfactual, is in
`tests/test_append_only_base_fence.py`; the verdicts above are reproducible with
`python -m scripts.ci.append_only_base_fence --check-only --onto <base> --head <head>`.
