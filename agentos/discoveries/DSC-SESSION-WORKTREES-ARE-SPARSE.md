  Before reading or writing site/, data/, or mockups/ — site tests, artifact builders,
  template-site pairing, design specimens — materialize the tree first
  (git sparse-checkout add <dir>) or request a full worktree. A builder that
  read-modify-writes a committed artifact against an omitted tree rebuilds from an
  empty base and silently SHRINKS it, so an unexpected site/ or data/ shrink diff is
  data loss, never an edit. Guards and tests that glob the omitted trees pass
  vacuously — a green site-suite in a sparse tree proves nothing.

## Detail

The sparse profile arrives with the worktree itself: the repo carries no sparse config
(`.claude/settings.json` has none), so the mechanism lives in account-level
worktree-creation tooling outside the tree — which is exactly why it is invisible in
the repo and easy to rediscover the hard way. Detection must read git
(`git config core.sparseCheckout`, `git sparse-checkout list`), never `is_dir()` on one
path — partial cones make single-path checks lie in both directions.

Two failure shapes this produces, both observed classes rather than hypotheticals:
silent artifact truncation (the read-modify-write shape in `so_what`), and vacuously
green guards (a suite globbing `site/**` collects zero files and passes). The safe
sequence for any session touching the omitted trees is: materialize, verify the base
artifact is non-empty, then build.
