  A local read-only GET of the official SEC bulk Submissions archive
  https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/daily-index/bulkdata/submissions.zip
  on 2026-08-18 returned HTTP 200 with Content-Length 1558585919 bytes
  (~1.45 GiB), ETag "c38423eb2d3aff3ea8e3145e16f6bceb-186", Last-Modified
  Tue, 18 Aug 2026 05:55:33 GMT, Content-Type application/zip, no redirect.
  The canary refused to stream the body because a defensible compressed
  maximum that admits this object would have to exceed roughly 1 GiB.
  Archive SHA-256, ZIP member count, canonical-member count, and AAPL/MSFT
  member hashes were therefore not measured.
falsifier: >
  Repeat the same GET with the declared edgar.user_agent, redirects
  disabled, and observe Content-Length absent or <= 1073741824, or a
  redirect/non-200 that makes this header inapplicable.
so_what: >
  Do not freeze MAX_BULK_ARCHIVE_BYTES above ~1 GiB and do not stream this
  object until Sol authorizes a bound that can admit 1558585919 bytes with
  growth room. FF-1P2 implementation of bulk acquisition is stopped on this
  measurement. Do not treat HTTP Last-Modified as sec_accepted_at.

This remains useful evidence for why submissions.zip was rejected. Sol
did not authorize a 2 GiB compressed bound and superseded
`DEC:FF-1-BROAD-SUBMISSIONS-USES-SEC-BULK-ARCHIVE` with
`DEC:FF-1-BROAD-DISCOVERY-USES-EDGAR-INDEXES` before merge. No production
R2 write occurred. The ZIP was not opened.
