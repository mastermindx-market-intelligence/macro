model: sol
ended_because: blocked
mission: >
  Make the current Realm1/P0B continuation recoverable without relying on chat history: correct the
  stale unconsumed-delivery record after the exact profile_B host child acknowledged and returned its
  no-effect checkout/host proof, pin the GitHub-only #432 source checkpoint and its unprotected
  LIVE_CENSUS_COMPLETENESS_REQUIRES_PATH_WIDENING hold, and preserve the account, PF-1, INSTALL1 and
  #355 boundaries that remain before any future host continuation.
state_before: >
  The active Chairman Control Room workstream still pointed at the 2026-08-25 fixed-port
  configure-canary-port and run-canary step. Since then Mastermind protected the bounded T1 native
  transport and completed several Realm1-C1 source repair waves, but PR #396 was still Draft/Hold
  when this Sol session resumed. Two issue comments also named different operation keys for the same
  future profile_B host effect, and no current Slack carrier or receiver existed for either key.
changed:
  - path: agentos/workstreams/WS-CHAIRMAN-CONTROL-ROOM.md
    what: >
      Correct P0B and the workstream-level next action from DELIVERY_UNCONSUMED to the actual
      receiver-bound host hold: task ACK and prior checkout/host proof exist, but #359 is still
      PRE_START / WAITING_SOURCE_REPAIR_432 / effect=NONE. Record #432 as a GitHub source checkpoint,
      not a reciprocal Slack return, with `BUILT_NOT_PROVEN / PRODUCTION_INERT` and the
      LIVE_CENSUS_COMPLETENESS_REQUIRES_PATH_WIDENING hold; preserve the Sol path-ceiling ruling,
      Chairman-only account authority, post-profile_B receipt order, downstream account/PF-1/INSTALL1,
      and #355 architecture-only boundaries.
      Corrected 2026-09-03 under ccr-agentos-realm1-census-owner-path-correction-20260903-sol-001:
      every authoritative census-owner path now reads `integrations/chairman_surfaces/chatgpt.py`,
      the stale "five-path head awaiting a path-ceiling ruling" state is replaced by the exact
      six-path expansion that ruling actually granted, and merged Macro PR #6804 is recorded as
      terminally STOPped.
  - path: agentos/handoffs/CHAIRMAN-CONTROL-ROOM-2026-09-03-realm1-source-protected-profile-b-placement.md
    what: >
      Maintain this exact cold-start continuation with current carrier facts: #431 terminal duplicate,
      #359 ACKed but effect-free hold, #432's exact task and GitHub source checkpoint plus Slack
      non-result, profile_A proven, profile_B/account unproven, and the do-not-redo boundaries needed
      by the next Sol session. Refreshed 2026-09-03 to the exact post-ruling #432 six-path state and
      the corrected canonical census-owner path; the census-owner path previously recorded here named
      a directory that holds no such file in either repository, so it was a transcription error and is
      retained nowhere rather than kept as a prior implementation identity.

      The historic Realm1-C1 source is protected as Mastermind PR #396 merge, while the sole successor
      source repair is open #432 with Draft PR #435. The source worker's durable checkpoint is on
      GitHub, not as a reciprocal Slack result. Sol has since issued the path-ceiling ruling: the #432
      ceiling is now exactly six paths, the sixth being `integrations/chairman_surfaces/chatgpt.py`,
      and the candidate head 62eaf50a remains not releasable until that strict-producer repair lands.

      25b5066de1ec528809911e5806fe81b3068543aa) with reviewDecision NONE. GitHub comment 5533580505
      recorded the worker's source checkpoint as `DRAFT / HOLD-FOR-SOL` and
      `BUILT_NOT_PROVEN / PRODUCTION_INERT`; comment 5533655499 reproduced
      `LIVE_CENSUS_COMPLETENESS_REQUIRES_PATH_WIDENING` in the best-effort producer; comment
      5533704747's hosted `test` and CodeQL SUCCESS remain mechanical evidence only. Sol then RULED on
      that blocker: comment 5535426302 (`REALM1_LC1_STRICT_INVENTORY_PRODUCER_R1`) expands the ceiling
      from five paths to exactly six by adding only `integrations/chairman_surfaces/chatgpt.py`, keeps
      `integrations/chairman_surfaces/runner.py` NO-EDIT, preserves legacy best-effort
      `list_local_environments()` for ordinary callers and requires one additional strict
      all-or-nothing acquisition owner used only by the trusted live MAS-115 boundary. Comment
      5535485976 adds the execution note, and comment 5535513439 corrects the truncation sentinel to a
      four-byte margin (`_PS_SNAPSHOT_MAX_BYTES + 4`, accepted limit still exactly 4 MiB), superseding
      the earlier `+1` wording and the earlier strict_contract_digest
      2b632cd37017919bf0acb378752979a8c90abdb3c9b603ddc1e0754781a27eeb with
      4b4c77c81a19dafdd6c0ecbed58f14025a41eea77efb2ec070a537e52c999f49. Comment 5535684208, carried on
      carrier edge 1788496349.357249, then
      corrected the inventory boundary — a valid 201st row is accepted and returned in full by the
      strict producer, which refuses only at the 1,001st valid identity, while the legacy API keeps its
      historical 200-row prefix — and comment 5535685009 pinned the exact closed `/bin/ps` result shape
      and the process-to-directory identity join, forbidding reuse of the tolerant
      `_default_process_args_reader()` / `_lines_show_running()` helpers as completeness authority.
      Sol also issued an ACCELERATED CONTINUE / CONDITIONAL EXPANDED START at carrier edge
      1788495816.349859: the bound task may now post `PATH_EXPANSION_FREEZE / REALM1-LC1-R4` and then,
      in a separate next reply and WITHOUT waiting for Sol, emit
      `START ... scope=REALM1-LC1-R4 effect=SOURCE_ONLY` and execute, provided every freeze field is
      truthfully satisfied; otherwise it returns one finite typed BLOCKED. The same operation, Codex
      task 01a0694f-56bb-71c0-9c35-6a0644691f20, worktree, branch
      sol/wsx-realm1-live-seat-census-gate-repair-20260903 and PR #435 are all retained; no new task,
      carrier, branch or PR was created. As of this readback the exact #432 Slack root
      C0BSBM78V1N/1788472184.797999 runs through a SOL EXACT-TASK TRANSPORT CHECK edge and still
      carries no worker `PATH_EXPANSION_FREEZE` and no post-build worker `RESULT / HOLD`; PR #435 is
      still OPEN / DRAFT at head 62eaf50a with reviewDecision NONE, so no later worker freeze, START or
      result may be inferred. This records PR remains exact-two Agent OS paths and adds no upstream
      source implementation.

  - claim: >
      The #432 candidate head 62eaf50a cannot be made protectable merely through independent review and
      protected-source readback, because its exact-head review reproduced
      LIVE_CENSUS_COMPLETENESS_REQUIRES_PATH_WIDENING: a sealed prefix is not exhaustive evidence.
    what_would_verify: >
      The Sol path-ceiling ruling has now been issued and keeps the same #432 task, branch and Draft
      PR #435 while expanding the ceiling to exactly six paths by adding
      integrations/chairman_surfaces/chatgpt.py, and Sol has additionally pre-authorized the
      expanded-scope START conditionally at carrier edge 1788495816.349859. What remains unverified is
      the repair itself: the same bound task must still post PATH_EXPANSION_FREEZE / REALM1-LC1-R4,
      then self-issue START scope=REALM1-LC1-R4, history-preservingly integrate current protected
      source, add the strict all-or-nothing acquisition owner with its RED/mutation discriminators, and
      prove exhaustive census behavior. Only then can the repaired exact head receive non-author review,
      merge into current Mastermind master and be read back from protected source. A Draft/Hold
      checkpoint, mechanically green CI, review, a path-ceiling ruling, a conditional START
      authorization, or source merge alone is insufficient.
  - claim: >
      The approved Mac host, exact v3 profile_A anchor, fixed private lifecycle coordinates,
      Multilogin launcher and Keychain-owned credential route still satisfy every refreshed pre-START
      gate under the repaired protected source.
    what_would_verify: >
      Only after #432's Sol-authorized path-widened repair proves exhaustive census behavior, gains the
      required independent review and protected-source readback, and receives one fresh same-root Sol
      continuation may the already-bound host worker refresh its protected checkout, perform the
      read-only HOST_PROFILE_GATE, and return opaque target/preimage/security/collision receipts with no
      local lifecycle, secret or vendor effect.
  - claim: >
      Exactly one missing profile_B can be created or reconciled and proven stopped/unowned without
      browser or Web-Sol residue.
    what_would_verify: >
      After a lawful separate START, the same bound task runs the protected first-rollout bootstrap
      when required, performs at most one vendor create, reconciles one exact response/census identity,
      persists the fixed peer provision and returns PROFILE_B_PROVEN with process/residue proof. A
      bounded negative downstream-ownership receipt may be minted only for rollback or downstream release
      after profile_B is provisioned; it is never a pre-create predicate or placeholder.
  - claim: >
      A dedicated non-sensitive ChatGPT account realm can be selected or created and normally signed
      into both disposable profiles with Projects and required memory settings available.
    what_would_verify: >
      Only after PROFILE_B_PROVEN, terminal STOP of the profile child, exact profile ownership release and
      a refreshed account-path census does the Chairman make the Chairman-only closed choice to use an
      eligible existing dedicated account or explicitly approve one free dedicated account. A secret owner
      may perform a credential ceremony but cannot authorize account creation or any paid plan. The later
      bounded account operation completes normal terms/verification/2FA and proves both profile realms
      without copying cookies or storage. No account child or paid-plan authority exists now.
unresolved:
  - "Issue #432 has a GitHub source-checkpoint head in Draft/Hold, not a Slack worker RESULT / HOLD. Its listed hosted exact-head checks are green, but its reproduced LIVE_CENSUS_COMPLETENESS_REQUIRES_PATH_WIDENING hold means candidate head 62eaf50a remains BUILT_NOT_PROVEN / PRODUCTION_INERT and cannot be protected merely by review/readback. Sol's path-ceiling ruling expanded the ceiling to exactly six paths and a later edge conditionally pre-authorized the expanded-scope START, but no worker PATH_EXPANSION_FREEZE / REALM1-LC1-R4 and no worker START have been posted and the remote head is unmoved, so the strict-producer repair is fully authorized in scope but not yet begun."
  - "The #359 host task is ACKed and has prior clean-checkout/approved-host proof, but remains PRE_START / WAITING_SOURCE_REPAIR_432 / effect=NONE."
  - "Profile_A is proven; profile_B has no live capability receipt, and no account realm is proven or signed into both profiles."
  - "No account child, account selection, account creation, payment choice, PF-1, INSTALL1 or browser action is authorized by this record. A secret owner is not account-creation or paid-plan authority."
  - "PF-1 A/B, INSTALL1, PF-1 C15-C18, final intended-seat foreground proof and #355 implementation remain unstarted or unproven."
next_actions:
  - "Keep #359 PRE_START / WAITING_SOURCE_REPAIR_432 / effect=NONE while #432's candidate head 62eaf50a remains held; do not create another host task, branch, PR, watcher or lifecycle."
  - "The Sol path-ceiling ruling has been issued: the #432 ceiling is exactly six paths, the sixth being integrations/chairman_surfaces/chatgpt.py, on the same task, branch and Draft PR #435, with runner.py NO-EDIT. The expanded-scope START is conditionally pre-authorized, so the next upstream step belongs to that already-bound task alone and needs no further Sol round trip: post PATH_EXPANSION_FREEZE / REALM1-LC1-R4, then self-issue START scope=REALM1-LC1-R4 effect=SOURCE_ONLY and build the strict all-or-nothing producer — or return one finite typed BLOCKED. Independent exact-head review and protected current-source readback of the repaired head remain required before any #359 preflight refresh."
  - "On that continuation, the existing #359 task alone re-reads protected source and returns the exact no-effect HOST_PROFILE_GATE; no bootstrap, Keychain, vendor, profile, account or browser action occurs first."
  - "Only after PROFILE_B_PROVEN, terminal STOP and exact profile ownership release can the Chairman make the closed existing-account versus explicitly approved one-free-account choice for a separate finite account-selection/sign-in ceremony; paid-plan authority remains absent."
  - "Only after both profiles and the account realm are independently released may PF-1 A/B, target release, INSTALL1 and the same PF-1 evidence epoch for C15-C18 proceed."
do_not_redo:
  - "Do not reopen or rebuild Mastermind PR #396 or issue #385; historic merge 771a9558 is source proof, while #432 is the sole current source-repair carrier."
  - "Do not revive closed #431 or create another source, host, account or profile carrier while the existing #359 and #432 tasks remain bound."
  - "Do not use the superseded web-sol-realm1-profile-b-host-create-20260902-sol-001 key or create another profile_B carrier/task while C0BSBM78V1N/1788455715.526229 is unresolved."
  - "Do not add integrations/chairman_surfaces/chatgpt.py or any upstream #432 source implementation to a Macro records PR; a Macro records carrier remains exactly the two named Agent OS records. That Mastermind-relative path is evidence prose here and grants no upstream source authority."
  - "Do not reintroduce the superseded census-owner spelling that the #6804 records carried, which placed chatgpt.py under a Mastermind directory holding no such file. Its exact wording survives only as external evidence in the merged #6804 diff and in same-carrier edge C0BSBM78V1N/1788474038.447649@1788488427.613269; it is not an alias, a prior implementation identity, or a 'formerly known as' note, and it belongs in no Agent OS record."
  - "Do not reopen, reuse or re-ACK merged Macro PR #6804 or its terminal operation ccr-realm1-agentos-current-state-repair-20260903-sol-001; corrections to those records belong to a fresh records carrier."
  - "Do not treat Slack delivery, Secretary attention, a task-create response, GitHub merge, green CI, Keychain-item presence or a vendor response as profile_B proof."
  - "Do not rerun the superseded six-input enroll-seats ceremony, refresh Chairman bindings merely to pass an age gate, reuse a Chairman profile/account, select an unqualified stopped profile, fall back to GoLogin, create a third profile, or start a browser in the profile_B child."
  - "Do not expose the Multilogin bearer through argv, environment, shell, temporary file, log, model-visible settings or durable receipt."
  - "Do not create a profile/account registry, second lifecycle, queue, retry ledger, public ownership-receipt writer, generic browser controller, RuntimeBinding/Wake path or another workstream."
  - "Do not blind-retry a lifecycle, release-receipt, Keychain or vendor effect after uncertainty; reconcile the same operation/task/host and exact fixed coordinates."
  - "Do not start PF-1, INSTALL1, account creation/sign-in or real Chairman-seat proof from the profile_B carrier."
danger_areas:
  - "A Slack root can look active while no native task consumed it; here #359 does have an ACK, but that receiver binding and its prior checkout/host proof still do not authorize execution or prove profile_B."
  - "The first-rollout bootstrap is local but modifying. It must not run before the exact host/profile/fixed-coordinate gate and separate START."
  - "The PF-1/INSTALL1 negative ownership receipt is a short-lived rollback/downstream-release artifact only after profile_B is provisioned, not a pre-create precondition, organizational registry or default-unowned assertion; its writer belongs only to the bounded host operation."
  - "An ambiguous create or remove effect pins the exact operation/task/host. Capacity loss or silence is not permission to create a second task or switch profiles."
  - "A positive source or profile result still leaves account terms, CAPTCHA, email/phone verification and 2FA as a Chairman-authorized human credential ceremony; a secret owner does not gain account-creation or paid-plan authority."
  - "Macro main moves frequently through generated hot-tape commits; records PRs must compose current main without overwriting unrelated Agent OS work."
  - "A durable record can carry a source path that never existed. These two records shipped a census-owner path under a Mastermind directory containing no such file, and it passed independent review, green CI and merge, because every downstream reader treated the earlier record as the authority instead of resolving the path against the Mastermind tree. The upstream #432 ruling and PR #435's own tree both name `integrations/chairman_surfaces/chatgpt.py`. Resolve a cross-repo path against that repository's actual tree before recording it as an owner; a records gate proves schema and citation form, never that a foreign-repo path resolves."

# Return point

Historic Mastermind `771a95586c7a31933ee612eafaa4d1471f57527b` remains the independently reviewed
Realm1-C1 source release. It does not release the current host child. The sole current source repair
is issue #432, `web-sol-realm1-live-seat-census-gate-repair-20260903-sol-001`, bound to
Codex task `01a0694f-56bb-71c0-9c35-6a0644691f20` on Slack root
`C0BSBM78V1N/1788472184.797999`, which now runs through edge `1788496383.612629` and still carries no
post-build worker `RESULT / HOLD`. The worker's GitHub source checkpoint is #432 comment 5533580505
for Draft PR #435 head `62eaf50af3b18b8ea165de2213393223f9e16f57` (tree
`25b5066de1ec528809911e5806fe81b3068543aa`) as `DRAFT / HOLD-FOR-SOL` with
`BUILT_NOT_PROVEN / PRODUCTION_INERT`; the effect remains source-only.
Comment 5533655499 records `LIVE_CENSUS_COMPLETENESS_REQUIRES_PATH_WIDENING`, so green hosted
`test` and CodeQL in comment 5533704747 cannot make that head protected or live.

Sol has since ruled on that blocker rather than leaving it open. Comment 5535426302
(`REALM1_LC1_STRICT_INVENTORY_PRODUCER_R1`) expands the #432 ceiling from five paths to exactly six by
adding only `integrations/chairman_surfaces/chatgpt.py`, keeps
`integrations/chairman_surfaces/runner.py` NO-EDIT, preserves the legacy best-effort
`list_local_environments()` API for ordinary UI/navigation callers, and requires one additional strict
all-or-nothing acquisition owner used only by the trusted live MAS-115 boundary — one `/bin/ps`
snapshot, no 200-row prefix, refusal rather than truncation at the 1,000-row ceiling, and refusal on
enumeration, timeout, malformed or oversize evidence. Comment 5535485976 adds the execution note and
comment 5535513439 corrects the truncation sentinel to a four-byte margin
(`_PS_SNAPSHOT_MAX_BYTES + 4`, accepted limit still exactly 4 MiB), superseding the earlier `+1`
wording; the controlling strict_contract_digest is
`4b4c77c81a19dafdd6c0ecbed58f14025a41eea77efb2ec070a537e52c999f49`. Comment 5535684208, carried on
carrier edge `1788496349.357249`, keeps a valid
201st row visible — the strict producer returns it in full and refuses only at the 1,001st valid
identity, while the legacy API keeps its 200-row prefix — and comment 5535685009 pins the exact closed
`/bin/ps` result shape plus the process-to-directory identity join, barring reuse of the tolerant
helpers as completeness authority. The same operation, Codex task, worktree, branch and PR #435 are
retained throughout — the rulings authorize scope, not a new carrier.

Sol has also removed the second round trip: the ACCELERATED CONTINUE / CONDITIONAL EXPANDED START at
carrier edge `1788495816.349859` lets the bound task post `PATH_EXPANSION_FREEZE / REALM1-LC1-R4` and
then, in a separate next reply without waiting for Sol, emit
`START ... scope=REALM1-LC1-R4 effect=SOURCE_ONLY` and execute — conditional on every freeze field
being truthfully satisfied, else one finite typed BLOCKED. The repair itself has still not begun: at
this readback no worker `PATH_EXPANSION_FREEZE` and no worker START exist on the carrier, PR #435
remains OPEN / DRAFT at unmoved head `62eaf50a` with reviewDecision NONE, and no later worker freeze,
START or result may be inferred. The operation's cited protected base is
`7022e70640637a4fa07f073442dc693301290e2a`; live Mastermind master has since advanced beyond it, and
that movement is the bound task's to integrate history-preservingly, not this records carrier's.

The correct Mastermind-relative census-owner path is `integrations/chairman_surfaces/chatgpt.py`.
An earlier same-carrier path-identity edge
(`C0BSBM78V1N/1788474038.447649@1788488427.613269`) placed chatgpt.py under a different Mastermind
directory, and that spelling was carried into the #6804 records; no file has ever existed at it in
either repository, and PR #435's own tree `25b5066de1ec528809911e5806fe81b3068543aa` contains only the
`chairman_surfaces` spelling. It is corrected here and retained nowhere, so a reader who meets the old
spelling in that Slack edge or the merged #6804 diff should resolve it to this path. This Macro
handoff records the upstream need but does not widen a records PR beyond its exact two Agent OS paths.

Macro PR #6804 — which first published these two records — is MERGED at
`f72d6430ccab5d67e9669c962e0334f46bb20d7b` (2026-09-04T03:39:54Z), and its operation
`ccr-realm1-agentos-current-state-repair-20260903-sol-001` is terminally STOPped on carrier
`C0BSBM78V1N/1788474038.447649` at edge `1788493795.031669`. That operation is closed and must not be
reopened or reused; this correction is carried by the separate records-only operation
`ccr-agentos-realm1-census-owner-path-correction-20260903-sol-001` on root
`C0BSBM78V1N/1788494388.342559`. Neither the merge, its green CI, its independent review, nor any
Slack delivery on either carrier is evidence of upstream implementation or of profile capability.

The canonical profile_B host child
`web-sol-realm1-profile-b-host-provision-20260902-sol-001` remains bound to
Codex task `01a06846-1b1b-7212-aa67-e6d303802489` on Slack root
`C0BSBM78V1N/1788455715.526229`. The task ACKed and previously proved a clean detached checkout plus
the approved host route, but the controlling state is `PRE_START / WAITING_SOURCE_REPAIR_432 /
effect=NONE`. It must not refresh the old gate or create any effect until the path-widened #432 repair
has removed the completeness hold, received independent review, been protected and read back, and Sol
emits one fresh same-root continuation. #431 is closed terminal with effect=NONE. Profile_A is proven;
profile_B and the dedicated account realm are not.

After a later `PROFILE_B_PROVEN` result, terminal STOP and exact profile ownership release, the Chairman
alone makes the closed choice of an eligible existing dedicated account or one explicitly approved free
account. A secret owner may perform the credential ceremony but has no account-creation or paid-plan
authority. Account selection/sign-in is then a separately authorized finite ceremony. PF-1, INSTALL1
and real-seat foreground proof remain ordered later gates, and #355 remains architecture/semantic-readiness
work only.
