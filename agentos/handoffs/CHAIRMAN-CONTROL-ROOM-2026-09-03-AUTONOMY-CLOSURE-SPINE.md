mission: >
  Close the records-only Autonomy Closure Spine F0 without adding it to the pre-canary critical path,
  preserve its repaired architecture as advisory evidence, and redirect execution to the existing
  owner train that must produce the first golden-root and adversarial multi-root evidence.
state_before: >
  Mastermind issue #437 and PR #438 proposed ACF-1 Semantic Directive Convergence before the first
  golden-root canary. The three-path candidate had been repaired at d6ffac38108c5d59f6cba02140068924e444d2b2,
  but no Runtime implementation, provider effect, deployment, or real production falsifier existed.
changed:
  - path: mastermindx-market-intelligence/Mastermind issue #437
    what: >
      Closed NOT_PLANNED and retained as post-golden-root evidence only.
  - path: mastermindx-market-intelligence/Mastermind PR #438
    what: >
      Closed unmerged at d6ffac38108c5d59f6cba02140068924e444d2b2; branch, checks, repaired
      contracts, and review history remain preserved but grant no implementation authority.
  - path: agentos/decisions/DEC-AUTONOMY-CLOSURE-SPINE-V1.md
    what: >
      Records the Chairman ruling that ACF-1 is deferred until a real golden-root/adversarial canary
      reproduces the exact decision-convergence failure.
  - path: agentos/discoveries/DSC-AUTONOMY-TARGET-AUTHORITY-DOES-NOT-CONVERGE-SEMANTIC-DIRECTIVES.md
    what: >
      Reclassifies the conceptual target-versus-decision distinction as an evidence-gated hypothesis
      rather than a pre-canary implementation requirement.
  - path: agentos/handoffs/CHAIRMAN-CONTROL-ROOM-2026-09-03-AUTONOMY-CLOSURE-SPINE.md
    what: >
      Reconciles the terminal F0 ruling to the protected source train as of 2026-09-05, exposes the
      live source-writer interlocks before MAT-S1, and records the Control Room warm-cache and Codex
      teardown gates that must close before installed/fleet acceptance.
verified:
  - claim: The F0 architecture and its review child remain terminal and unmerged.
    command: >
      Read Slack C0BSBM78V1N/1788495922.483179 through terminal STOP 1788508703.540179 and read
      Mastermind issue #437 plus PR #438.
    result: >
      Issue #437 is CLOSED / NOT_PLANNED; PR #438 is CLOSED_UNMERGED at
      d6ffac38108c5d59f6cba02140068924e444d2b2. No ACF-1 implementation child is authorized.
  - claim: Major prerequisite source leaves have progressed without ACF-1.

      Continuity R3 #448 are protected. They remain source receipts rather than installation, Runtime,
      provider, or production proof.
  - claim: The current protected source still does not contain the whole Stage-B materialization chain.
    command: >
      Read research/autonomy_cutover/2026-09-05-production-preflight-01a06f74.md and current MAT-S1
      issue #430 against protected Mastermind 8f3370e349ab8f1a54acac4c63697740f32715b1.
    result: >
      C2-R1A is built in protected source; MAT-S1, first-root Stage-B1, and later-root C2-R1B remain
      absent. MAT-S1 issue #430 remains SPEC_ONLY / predecessor-held / production-disarmed.
  - claim: CAP-S1 and Runtime Continuity are active on their existing sticky carriers.
    command: >
      Read CAP carrier C0BSBM78V1N/1788511189.200899 and Runtime carrier
      C0BSBM78V1N/1788585580.469589, plus Mastermind PRs #350 and #491.
    result: >
      CAP-S1 #350 is executing its existing two-path repair/current-base proof through exact task
      01a06b9a-eb73-7003-b9e5-ea35d5c45269 with no provider replay. Runtime Continuity #491 is an
      incomplete whole-R2 Draft/HOLD checkpoint on exact task 01a06f73-1dba-7951-9f1e-cded7b563cef.
  - claim: MAT-S1 cannot safely start immediately after CAP-S1 protection while current source writers remain.
    command: >
      Compare issue #430's expected twelve-path ceiling with exact current changed-file inventories for
      Runtime Continuity PR #491 and HF1-A PR #471.
    result: >
      PR #491 currently owns `control_plane/executive_service.py` and
      `tests/test_executive_service.py`; PR #471 currently owns `scripts/executive_os_phase1c.py`.
      All three paths are in MAT-S1's expected maximum. HF1-A also remains source-held behind CAP-S1
      for its release-package repair. A fresh final MAT-S1 path/owner census must therefore wait for
      protected or terminally released CAP-S1, Runtime R2, and HF1-A source ownership unless a new
      owner ruling lawfully shrinks the MAT-S1 path set.
  - claim: The protected Control Room can lose canonical dispatch evidence after a live-build refresh.
    command: >
      Read issue #488, active source carrier PR #496, and Slack root
      C0BSBM78V1N/1788603418.877459 through repair checkpoint 1788615438.499229.
    result: >
      The cold path gathers dispatch/W3C/C2 evidence through the canonical builder while the protected
      warm-cache path duplicates collection and omits that gather. PR #496 is an active three-path
      source repair on exact task 01a05ccd-918b-7102-8643-6951c0413424. It is not installed or
      production proven and must protect before a refreshed Control Room can be used as golden-canary proof.
  - claim: Codex worker cancellation has a bounded transport-finalization design but no current releasable source.
    command: >
      Read issue #380, PR #392, issue #389, HF1-A PR #471, and execute the bounded escaped-pipe-holder
      subprocess probes recorded in PR #392 comment 5552186921.
    result: >
      Exact original-group absence can coexist with a known leader return code and pending asyncio
      Process.wait/pipe-reader tasks. Closing only the exact adapter-owned subprocess transport after
      the return code is known completed the wait/readers without calling the underlying process kill
      or signalling a PGID. The old #392 child is terminal; HF1-A currently owns both required source
      paths, so implementation remains held for a fresh post-HF1 successor.
unverified:
  - claim: The current owner train can complete one real golden-root journey without ACF-1.
    what_would_verify: >
      Protect CAP-S1, Runtime R2, HF1-A and the warm-cache Control Room repair; build and protect MAT-S1
      and Stage-B1; install and arm the accepted components; then run one real root through placement,
      exact worker execution, semantic return, exact Sol attention, continuation, and truthful Control
      Room projection with zero routine Chairman shuttle.
  - claim: MAT-S1's final current-source path set still requires all three currently overlapping paths.
    what_would_verify: >
      After CAP-S1, Runtime R2 and HF1-A source release, re-read protected dependencies and shrink the
      twelve-path maximum. Any omission must preserve the internal materialization command, carrier lease
      keeper/current-writer read, and default-off Phase1C/service composition promised by issue #430.
  - claim: The Codex teardown design closes the pending-wait state on every supported floor without widening signal authority.
    what_would_verify: >
      After HF1-A releases the two paths, reproduce on supported macOS/CPython floors; remove both
      strict-xfail markers; prove one bounded local transport finalization, zero later PGID probe/signal,
      preserved live-residual-group SIGKILL, truthful partial-output disposition, full CI/security, and
      fresh non-author review.
  - claim: ACF-1 remains unnecessary after adversarial multi-root proof.
    what_would_verify: >
      Run sister-Sol, stale-target, conflicting-continuation, response-loss, restart, unsafe-retry,
      capacity-saturation, and effect-unknown scenarios and observe exactly one lawful downstream effect
      under existing owner enforcement.
  - claim: Source-protected Control Room and Wake code are installed and producing truthful live joins.
    what_would_verify: >
      Obtain exact installed-release identities, service health, real source-attributed observations,
      Wake delivery/ACK/source-resolution receipts, and browser-visible Control Room proof before and
      after one live-build refresh.
unresolved:
  - "CAP-S1 PR #350 remains OPEN/DRAFT. Its sticky source task is performing current-base canonical-RWE/component proof and must return immutable source/security/review evidence before source acceptance."
  - "Runtime Continuity R2 PR #491 remains PARTIAL / DRAFT-HOLD; physical source identity, ACK/source resolution, causal return, current-base proof, review, and real canary remain owed. Its service/test paths currently overlap MAT-S1's expected ceiling."
  - "HF1-A PR #471 remains OPEN/DRAFT and owns scripts/executive_os_phase1c.py, an expected MAT-S1 path. It also needs the CAP-owned release-package path after CAP terminal release."
  - "Control Room warm-cache parity PR #496 remains OPEN/DRAFT under its existing source owner; source CI/review and protected release are separate from installed refresh proof."
  - "Codex teardown evidence PR #392 remains OPEN/DRAFT with its old child terminal; both source paths are held by HF1-A and require a fresh post-HF1 successor before fleet acceptance."
  - "MAT-S1 issue #430 remains SPEC_ONLY and predecessor/source-writer held; no implementation branch or provider attempt is authorized from the issue alone."
  - "Stage-B1 and C2-R1B remain NOT_BUILT after MAT-S1; they are separate first-root and later-root children."
  - "W3C, C2-R1A, MAT-C1, Control Room, Web diagnostics, and R3 are BUILT_NOT_PROVEN source capabilities; installed/armed/runtime proof remains separate."
  - "AD-RET2 sustained PROGRESS/BLOCKED/DECISION_REQUEST return proof and the production-cutover union of 18 adverse obligations remain unexecuted."
  - "The golden-root, SHADOW measurements, two-to-three-responsibility CANARY, and adversarial multi-root runs have not occurred."
next_actions:
  - >
    Finish CAP-S1 on its existing task/carrier: complete the bound RWE/component proof, publish one
    current-base candidate, obtain exact-head CI/security and independent review, then accept/STOP the
    source child and release its paths without replaying the historical provider attempt.
  - >
    Continue Runtime Continuity R2 on PR #491 and HF1-A on PR #471 under their existing owners. HF1-A
    may consume the CAP-owned package-path release only after CAP source termination; Runtime R2 must
    complete the real source-resolution/Wake/ACK/return vertical and release its service/test paths.
  - >
    Finish warm-cache parity PR #496 on its existing three-path carrier and protect it before installed
    Control Room/golden-canary proof. Preserve one canonical gather and prove the real cached consumer;
    do not replace the Control Room owner or call source release production proof.
  - >
    Only after CAP-S1, Runtime R2 and HF1-A are protected or their overlapping source ownership is
    terminally released, run one fresh MAT-S1 current-source/path/host/effect/placement census from
    issue #430. Shrink the twelve-path maximum where current protected owners make paths unnecessary;
    otherwise preserve and compose their protected results. Then start one bounded MAT-S1 child.
  - >
    After HF1-A releases `control_plane/codex_worker.py` and
    `tests/test_executive_codex_worker.py`, start one fresh two-path #392 maintenance successor using
    the bounded local-transport-finalization design. It may run in parallel with a path-disjoint MAT-S1
    child but must protect before adversarial cancellation/fleet acceptance.
  - >
    After MAT-S1 protection, build first-root Stage-B1 and later-root C2-R1B as separate bounded
    children, preserving SessionTargetRegistry, RuntimeBinding, Capacity, and Executive OS ownership.
  - >
    Install and arm only accepted default-off components in a declared SHADOW posture, freeze real
    endpoint/clock/denominator/latency/fairness budgets, then run the two-to-three-responsibility golden
    canary and the adverse multi-root matrix. Reopen ACF-1 only if the recorded falsifier occurs.
do_not_redo:
  - "Do not reopen or merge Mastermind #438 merely because its repaired checks later pass."
  - "Do not create an ACF-1 task, branch, Event family, consumer, or Control Room projection before canary evidence."
  - "Do not revive terminal W3C, C2-R1A, Control Room, Web #485, R3 source, #392, or their old review/source children."
  - "Do not replay CAP-S1's consumed historical provider attempt or fabricate its unavailable cleanup."
  - "Do not start MAT-S1 on issue-body path assumptions while #491 or #471 still owns overlapping paths."
  - "Do not merge old #392 over HF1-A or silently absorb the teardown lifecycle repair into HF1-A."
  - "Do not treat Control Room warm-cache source parity as installed/browser proof."
  - "Do not create a duplicate lifecycle, queue, retry plane, target registry, directive store, RuntimeBinding store, or Slack command bus."
  - "Do not call protected source, CI, merge, installation, transport delivery, or QUEUED admission production proof."
danger_areas:
  - "A conceptual architecture gap is not automatically a production blocker; the ACF-1 falsifier remains evidence-gated."
  - "Source protection can still leave the user journey dark because installation, arming, exact target delivery, semantic return, continuation, refresh parity, and cancellation finalization are separate gates."
  - "CAP-S1 source acceptance must remain independent of a successful completed-canary issuer while still refusing forged proof."
  - "MAT-S1 must not run a model turn or complete/tear down the role-null carrier it is supposed to materialize as the current writer."
  - "MAT-S1's conceptual dependency DAG is not the complete source-write schedule: current Runtime R2 and HF1-A path ownership must be reconciled before its final path freeze."
  - "A proven-absent original process group ends signal authority; local asyncio transport retirement must never become process adoption or authority over escaped descendants."
  - "Runtime R2 and Stage-B share dependencies but do not transfer authority or justify duplicate current-writer, target, Wake, or lifecycle owners."
  - "Golden CI, merge, Slack delivery, Runtime execution, SHADOW measurement, CANARY, and final production acceptance remain distinct."

# Return point

Autonomy Closure Spine F0 is terminal and preserved as post-golden-root evidence only. Protected
source includes W3C-I1, C2-R1A, MAT-C1, Control Room phase A, Web diagnostic hardening, and Source
Continuity R3 without ACF-1.

The current implementation schedule is CAP-S1 source protection; Runtime R2 in parallel; HF1-A after
CAP releases its shared package path; warm-cache Control Room parity in parallel; then a fresh MAT-S1
path freeze only after CAP, Runtime R2, and HF1-A protect or release their overlapping source. The
Codex teardown successor starts only after HF1-A releases its two paths and must protect before fleet
cancellation acceptance. MAT-S1 is followed by first-root Stage-B1 and later-root C2-R1B, then installed
SHADOW evidence, one real golden-root canary, and the adversarial multi-root matrix.

The exact trigger for reopening ACF-1 remains a reproduced current-source canary failure showing that
more than one otherwise-lawful semantic decision becomes effective, or that a stale/observer decision
causes a downstream mutation despite exact action-target and same-carrier enforcement.
