  Recover the stalled BioCatalyst R0 source lane, apply the prepared record
  and child-packet repairs, and leave the actual source/review state recoverable
  without treating an unavailable original conversation as the product owner.
state_before: >
  Macro PR 6712 was an open draft at 02cca90f127e23b184da25a2290b0da63f8c8f19.
  The original principal was stopped as incomplete. Its finite source-effect
  audit found no unpublished Macro source candidate; native watcher cleanup
  remained unverified. The prepared four-file repair had not been applied.

    result: "Skillpack 1.0.1/bootstrap 1; eleven loaded procedure files byte-identical to the previously read governing versions."
unverified:
  - claim: Whole-R0 architecture acceptance and permission to release this draft.
    what_would_verify: Independent actual-head architecture review, closed R0 findings and concluded current required integration checks, followed by explicit in-scope acceptance.
  - claim: Broad event-universe and What Matters Next production capability.
    what_would_verify: Accepted R1A/R1B implementation, real source publication and entitled dual-theme EN/ZH desktop/mobile browser proof.
  - claim: The old native principal consumed STOP and removed its historical Cron source.
    what_would_verify: A permitted exact-native terminal-consumption and child-source-removal receipt; none is claimed here.
unresolved:
  - "R0 findings 1/2/3 are architecturally resolved by reviews 5126025473 and 5126573589. Actual experience references, remaining research review, canonical workstream reconciliation and current integration remain open; the product is not built by these decisions."
  - "The prior 44-amendment write batch was blocked before application and remained unapplied; do not infer its completion or route around the refusal."
  - "At the 15:46Z observation, both trusted executor packs were queued. Other green checks are not an all-green CI result."
  - "The inactive ci-authority/codex/merge-queue-pilot context reports inactive_base_context; active ci-authority/main passed. Do not manufacture a Bio authority-code repair or bypass required checks."
next_actions:
  - Continue biocatalyst-v3-r0-source-repair-20260906-sol-001 on PR 6712; reconcile fresh head and current integration before any further source effect.
  - Preserve the completed whole-R0 REQUEST_CHANGES review 5125937773 and closed policy/interface findings; review only residual or changed requirements rather than commissioning the same full audit again.
  - Resolve only the review's concrete R0 blockers within current permissions; keep Draft/HOLD and preserve any withheld write boundary.
  - After objective R0 acceptance, use fresh bounded assignments for R1A source graduation and R1B What Matters Next. No routine new Chairman approval is added.
do_not_redo:
  - Do not reapply the pushed four-file patch or repeat archive-only reviews.
  - Do not reopen the stopped original principal to perform new work or repeat the complete 2341-tool source-effect census.
  - Do not require all R1 production capabilities to be implemented before accepting a records-only R0 architecture; R0 must freeze their executable contracts and proof requirements.
  - Do not make R1B depend on the separate held PR 6389 or take over its account-local watcher.
  - Preserve the ended soak's exact policy, clock, 336-opportunity denominator and missing-evidence distinctions.
  - Reuse existing event, identity, evidence, publication, scheduler, lifecycle and research-action owners.
danger_areas:
  - The shared macro-main checkout belongs to another project. Only the existing isolated Bio repair workspace is this source operation's worktree.
  - A Chat summary incorrectly reported no applied or pushed repair after GitHub already held 3b4cc150. GitHub implementation evidence overrides that stale summary.
  - Native watcher cleanup is WATCH_STOP_FAILED, not proof of a live worker and not permission to reopen its terminal assignment.
  - Research-priority ordering is not trade, Availability or sizing authority.

## Current continuation, not product closeout

This is a records-only checkpoint at a held acceptance boundary; it does not
terminate the active source-repair operation or assert a completed program.
The blocked end-reason identifies that boundary, not a successful R0 verdict.

GitHub PR 6712 comment 5559857052 records the failed original principal's
organizational source-release adjudication. The original principal STOP is
Slack C0BSBM78V1N/1788249930.227089 reply 1788700999.823019. Finite recovery and
connection-diagnosis children were stopped at 1788704191.940879 and
1788704476.848369 respectively; permanent Secretary and sibling sources remain
independently governed. No physical process death or native Cron removal is
claimed. This handoff records those receipts and creates no runtime authority.

Review 5125845882 closes only the finite four-file review. The reviewer found
no introduced defect and did not execute tests or independently reproduce the
integration. The later 76-pass hydrated-export result supersedes the earlier
75-pass/one-missing-artifact result; neither result is hosted CI or browser proof.

R0 must deliver an independently reviewed executable architecture. R1A/R1B
must then deliver real broad source truth and the What Matters Next journey.
Keeping those completion laws separate prevents both false completion and a
circular requirement that R1 already be built before R1 may start.

## Later September 6 continuation: use the accepted decisions

The current source chain now includes the external refresh at 16f7372, accepted RP policy at 75a9943, accepted interface specification at a335729, and the two explicit mapping clarifications at 1774fde6a9d06067406bdc9c0f9c0bdcc0ec9648. The historical 3b4cc150/828141 statements above bind their own observations; they are not the latest-head assertion. Read the current PR before every source effect. The external benchmark brief's section 13 links the accepted answers to its earlier open questions without rewriting the historical external evidence.

Whole-R0 review 5125937773 is complete and terminal. Its findings 1/2/3 now have the accepted policy/interface decisions recorded in reviews 5126025473 and 5126573589. Do not commission another worker to rediscover those same choices. The original interface review had 180 recorded events and a terminal result; the differently named proposed evidence review was blocked before execution and has no supervisor/result. They are not interchangeable.

The proposed six-state experience-document command was blocked before execution; no successful experience artifact or review is claimed. The separate earlier authority/workstream amendment batch and detailed production inventory also remain withheld. This handoff records new actual source/review facts; it does not retry those operations, supersede the canonical workstream or authorize a proxy. The outstanding experience and organizational reconciliation gates are explicit, not removed by documentation.

Current protected procedure for the later adjudication is Mastermind f9e46a72d6102b0e94c897590fc58bac89eb4ea6, Skillpack 1.0.1/bootstrap 1. Old local schema/merge-tree results remain exact historical proof only. Current required integration and any changed semantic delta must still be checked; no hosted green, R0 release or product completion is inferred from those earlier results.

## CIK candidate review checkpoint — September 7 UTC / September 6 ET

Review operation `biocatalyst-cik-reader-candidate-review-20260906-sol-001`
was deliberately commissioned in PR6712 comment5563229279 and terminally
accepted/stopped in comment5563306605. The complete proposed method is retained
in the commission, not implemented on this records-only source branch.

The independent reviewer found no material candidate defect. Its in-memory
characterization is not execution of the full upstream module or pytest suite.
The separate upstream baseline/candidate test-export request was refused before
execution and remains NOT_RUN; do not retry it through another surface or worker.

This checkpoint records that new review only. It does not change the canonical
workstream, satisfy finding6, produce visual evidence for finding4, accept whole
R0, or authorize R1/source activation. Previously refused workstream, experience,
authority, production-inventory and probe operations remain withheld. The
prepared lookup still needs an authorized implementation and actual consumer
proof after the applicable gates. No duplicate candidate review is owed.
