mission: >
  Record the Chairman-delivered Market Intelligence Productization packet
  (2026-08-23) as durable repo truth, census the program state at dispatch time,
  and file the K1 double-dispatch collision + authenticated-MO rider-gap receipt
  so Sol's K1 review and the next dispatcher act on canonical text instead of
  Downloads-folder transport.
state_before: >
  The productization packet (masterplan, capability ledger, wave graph, FABLE-A
  K1 commission with authenticated-MO rider, B1A commission + reference
  composition, Sol P1 adjudication, K1/K3/K5 rider) existed only in the
  operator's ~/Downloads — invisible to every fleet session. A1A had just been
  Sol-accepted with records closeout #6310 merged (e743db23, 10:43Z). The K1
  lane was already occupied: PR #6319 (claude/k1-evidence-foundation-20260823,
  head ead0076a) open and active from a live sibling worktree under
  macro-main/.claude/worktrees/. B1A: PREPARED_NOT_AUTHORIZED. A1B: todo,
  awaiting its own bounded Sol commission.

      The #6319 authoring session executed a K1 commission text that lacked the

  - claim: B1A dispatch gate 4 (live AAPL event_workspace.v1 availability and identity consistency) is currently true.

    Whether Sol accepts #6319's K1 as-is. Its frozen surface is the
    EvidenceRef/pointer layer (reference.v1 schema, vocabulary, object classes,
    clocks, identity joins, corrections/missingness/replay, fixtures, adverse
    flip verdict) and it is real, coherent work — but the recorded FABLE-A
    commission §6 additionally requires EvidenceBlock and EvidenceRecipe
    contracts, and §13.9 requires a golden AAPL Security State evidence recipe;
    B1A's producer chain names "accepted K1 evidence recipe". Options: accept as
    partial K1 with a bounded K1-B completion wave, or return #6319 for rider
    completion. Sol's call, not a session's.
  - A1B has no bounded Sol commission yet (WS:MARKET-OS A1B next_action governs).

    (gate 1 is already satisfied by #6310).

    A1B (Portfolio Fast Start Import): issue the separate bounded Sol commission
    required by WS:MARKET-OS before any code write; it must not be widened into
    event intelligence or B1.
do_not_redo:
  - Do not open a parallel K1 lane; PR #6319 owns K1 under the fleet claim law.
  - >
    Do not treat this records PR or the recorded masterplan as build
    authorization: the masterplan's authority line grants no GitHub mutation,
    and B1A stays PREPARED_NOT_AUTHORIZED until its four gates are true.
  - >
    Do not re-transport the packet from ~/Downloads; from this merge the
    research/market_intelligence_productization/ copies are canonical

danger_areas:

    PR #6319 edits agentos/workstreams/WS-ALPHA-INTELLIGENCE-INTEGRATION.md and
    agentos/handoffs/ALPHA-INTELLIGENCE-INTEGRATION-2026-08-23-k1.md; any
    records work touching those files before it merges will conflict with the
    occupied lane.
  - >
    B1A gate 2 is Sol acceptance of K1, not the merge of #6319 — green CI on
    the twin PR is explicitly not final K1 acceptance per its own stop boundary.

# Productization packet recorded; K1 double-dispatch receipt

The 2026-08-23 Market Intelligence Productization packet is now durable repo
truth under `research/market_intelligence_productization/` (9 files + manifest,
byte-verified). This ends the Chairman-as-transport state that the Sol P1
adjudication §8 prohibits, and gives Sol's K1 review and every later dispatcher
the canonical commission text — including the authenticated-MO rider that the
in-flight K1 execution (#6319) shows zero textual trace of.

This session deliberately did NOT: open a parallel K1 lane (claim law; #6319 is
live), start B1A (gates 2–4 open), start A1B (no bounded Sol commission), or
edit any file the twin PR owns.
