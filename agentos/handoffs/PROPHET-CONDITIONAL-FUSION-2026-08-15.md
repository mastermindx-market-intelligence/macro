  PR-2 / wave w2: the C2 regularized evidence-family stack + the §5.3 redundancy/
  estimability/CMI plane + the cross-fitted incremental-vs-Prophet harness, under the
  frozen §9.2 fold law — which REFUSES the inferential fit on the 24-date frame. The
  wave's lawful product: the machinery (synthetic-proven, mutation-receipted), the
  descriptive tables, the governed family-grain BH-FDR table (ZERO rejections under
  the t-referenced instrument), and the registry truth repairs (short_int
  pit_settlement with backtest admission DEFERRED; the variance-floor law; sue_z
  deferral). Independent adversarial review: SHIP-WITH-FIXES, 2 BLOCKER + 5 MAJOR +
  5 ADVISORY, all reproduced-then-fixed; disposition table in the wave doc §12.

  PR-1b (#5667) merged 2026-08-14T21:16Z. Graded frame unchanged since the race
  (24 dates 06-15..07-31; H=42/63 zero; no prophet-scored date graded). Candidates
  store: 5 stamps, last curated 2026-08-07. §13.0 closure OPEN at session start; two
  stale pre-merge-head daily runs queued (31756228858, 31753425298); tonight's cron
  run 31848262472 (22:52Z) was superseded/cancelled by sibling 31851452961 (23:45Z),
  pending at handoff time.

unresolved:
  - "short_int knowable-lag reconciliation CHIPPED to the owning lane (task_a85de1cd):

  - "PR-1a advisories A3 (_safe_out_dir scope) / A4 (dummy stamping) / A5
    (disclosed_gaps fail-open) / A7 (sparse-tree vacuity) remain open, deliberately
    not absorbed into a research PR"
  - "insider panel collector still stopped at 2026q1; name_score two-memories with the
    owning lane; F3 relay 0.000 / theme payload §13.4 repair items unchanged"
next_actions:
  - "PR-3 (wave w3): nightly shadow-scoring lane EXACTLY on the PR-1b prereg (G3, G4,
    C1-as-raced, C1-minus-F2 vs G0/G0'); W2 registers NO new rung and its
    zero-rejection table perturbs nothing. Carry in: as-of-night floor evaluation on
    BOTH axes (presence + variance); the t-referenced p instrument for graded tables;
    §13.0 closure as a precondition for trusting context-vector-fed telemetry"
  - "Verify §13.0 on the first completed post-merge nightly (see unverified)"
  - "C2 fitted read re-enters when the fold law is satisfiable: 91 graded dates needed,
    67 more than held (arithmetic derived through arena.build_folds itself)"
  - "Watch ~2026-08-24: first H=10 grade maturation (unchanged)"
do_not_redo:
  - "Do not fit C2 in-sample on a refused frame — no fallback path exists; adding one
    is the weakened-fit failure the commissioning forbids"
  - "Do not re-tune the variance floor against outcomes — feature-only law; its
    multiplicity lever is disclosed in §7's sensitivity block (zero rejections at
    both F8-p extremes)"
  - "Do not quote the draft's one-rejection F5 table — it was an artifact of the
    normal-approximation p at 15 blocks and exists in no committed artifact; the
    governed instrument is t-referenced and the committed table has ZERO rejections"
  - "Do not treat pit_settlement as backtest-admissible until the knowable-lag
    reconciliation lands — the deferral is fail-closed and its tests flip with it"
  - "Do not treat pit_settlement as depth — 3 settlements; backfill before deep joins"
  - "(inherited) PR-0/PR-1a/PR-1b do_not_redo lists remain binding — see the
    2026-08-14 handoff, which this file supersedes as latest"
danger_areas:
  - "The F5 'nearest miss' decomposes: score-membership (+0.074) leans on the
    serving-dead insider member; serving-lawful is +0.052 with CI covering zero —
    a forward-looking reader (PR-3) reasons from the latter"
  - "At 12-15 date-blocks the normal-approximation p is NOT a neutral convenience
    (it manufactured the draft's only rejection); governed tables carry both
    references, verdicts key on t"
  - "(inherited) G0-replay is not 'what the champion did live'; G4's tie-band;
    payload-less dates leave the deployed cell; era boundaries"

Cold-stranger summary: W2 asked whether enough lawful data exists to fit the evidence
families, and the honest answer — refused, 67 more graded dates needed — is the wave's
central result, delivered with the complete machinery to run the fit the day the fold
law is satisfiable. The descriptive plane it lawfully established: 3 families / 4
members are even fit-eligible today; the estate's load-bearing redundancy is within F2
(alpha×off_high +0.436), not across families; and under the governed t-referenced
BH-FDR instrument NO family's incremental-over-Prophet read survives — F5 is the
nearest miss and its serving-lawful form covers zero. An independent adversarial review
(SHIP-WITH-FIXES) forced the p-instrument correction that dissolved the draft's only
rejection, caught the F5 serving-dead lean, and blocked the pit_settlement backtest
admission on a measured under-waiting lag — all dispositioned in the wave doc §12.
Next real evidence arrives from forward accrual: the §13.0 closure, then PR-3's
prospective shadow race on the PR-1b prereg, unchanged.
