workstream: WS:GREY-DEER-RISK-INTELLIGENCE
session: claude/china-participation-context-20260921-sol
model: sol
ended_because: context_budget
mission: 'Deliver a coherent China macro page: trustworthy breadth inputs, truthful
  risk/null interpretation, dated participation and constituent evidence; no invented
  forecast authority.'
state_before: The China page lacked an aligned display of full-board daily participation,
  sampled multiday returns, same-cohort trend changes and absolute sector returns.
changed:
- path: engine/china_participation.py
  what: Add read-only dated price-library, whole-board and sector-ETF context using
    existing stores; leave the existing classifier and historical tape unchanged.
- path: scripts/build_china.py
  what: Bind the context to the producer assessment date in the existing page view-model.
- path: templates/_china_participation_context.html.j2
  what: Add one compact three-column evidence panel and native expandable detail,
    reusing the deep page and its material system.
- path: tests/test_china_participation.py
  what: Cover missing/stale/invalid/future data, matched denominators, benchmark absence,
    absolute-versus-relative returns and bilingual null presentation.
- path: scripts/build_china.py + templates/china.html.j2
  what: Qualified legacy CN rendering copy identifies historical stress and sampled
    breadth without changing raw model, odds or policy fields.
- path: collectors/china_breadth.py + engine/china_tier1.py + templates/china.html.j2
  what: Integrate existing PR7592 safeguards into PR7622 without changing its original
    branch/controller; preserve both code histories and both test groups.
- path: collectors/china_universe.py + engine/china_participation.py + templates/_china_participation_context.html.j2
  what: Qualify the official dated close-weight file and consume it as a fixed-start
    basket with explicit retrospective scope; automatic ingestion is not enabled.
verified:
- claim: Integrated source and neighboring consumers pass together.
  command: python -m pytest tests/test_china_participation.py tests/test_china_archetype_d_s1.py

    tests/test_breadth_constituents_repair.py tests/test_breadth_split_seam.py -q
    --tb=short
  result: 389 passed; three added integration cases; extreme integer bug reproduced
    as two failures before bounds-check repair. Earlier proof remains in committed
    research/evidence.
- claim: The final normalized combined page retains both repair streams and works
    through its real browser controls.
  command: RENDER_NO_DRIP=1 CHINA_FAST_RENDER=1 python -m scripts.build_china; existing
    lib.pages normalization; python research/grey_deer/capture_china_risk_reading.py
    --integrated
  result: Final16 rest/focus captures and8 integrated interactions pass after auxiliary-output
    cleanup; page0d75fe73 unchanged; source/input/asset fingerprints verified; offline
    only.
- claim: Official-weight parser, arithmetic and optional page consumer
  command: python -m pytest tests/test_china_universe_index_constituents.py tests/test_china_participation.py
    tests/test_china_archetype_d_s1.py -q --tb=short
  result: 220 passed,31 added cases,10 inherited warnings. Source90e9e9eae2c6; no
    clock/recovery repair is counted.
- claim: Actual builder consumes manually injected genuine official-file data and
    renders the new detail
  command: python research/grey_deer/probe_china_index_weights.py <operation-local
    official workbook>
  result: 8 captures and8 interactions passed. Page27296118..., source90e9e9eae2c6.
    Source table not written;27 generated outputs restored after evidence preservation;
    no production claim.
- claim: Current-source missing-member coverage explanation and incumbent shared Lens
    integration preserve existing semantics.
  command: python -m pytest [12 owning suites recorded in source-current evidence];
    node --check templates/theme.js; node --check site/theme.js; actual source/input/asset
    hash comparisons
  result: 544 passed,10 inherited warnings;14 new coverage cases;17 JS/CSS stamps
    match; six pinned input/ledger files unchanged. Final browser acceptance remains
    false.
unverified:
- claim: Current production deployment, fresh collection and release acceptance.
  what_would_verify: Later exact-source CI/integration, accepted release and real
    production page/input proof; Chairman explicitly deferred CI this turn.
- claim: Cap-weight contribution, representative equal-weight-index divergence or
    predictive pullback accuracy.
  what_would_verify: Matched-universe constituent weights/history and separate accepted
    calibration; this sample is not that evidence.
- claim: Independent settled-session freshness and official weighted index attribution.
  what_would_verify: Resolve the exact platform-refused clock edit before implementing/passing
    its15 pending cases. Attribution additionally needs an accepted historical-membership
    and official starting-weight source; neither is manufactured from library caps.
- claim: Automatic official-weight source supply
  what_would_verify: Resolve the exact protective refresh-test append refusal, then
    implement and verify the existing-source refresh without bypass. The current reader
    has explicit absent-state behavior.
- claim: Post-6860 actual first-click/touch browser acceptance on source9c6bef3f37f9.
  what_would_verify: Resolve exact OpenAI safety-status refusal before any lawful
    same-carrier run of the preserved current-source browser command; no reroute/retry
    by another actor.
unresolved:
- Hosted CI, source-current-main qualification and release remain intentionally deferred;
  PR7592 retains its unchanged external release carrier.
- Current library membership is a descriptive sample, not historical point-in-time
  constituents or the CSI300 universe.
- Benchmark observation dates do not certify complete exchange-calendar availability
  or source publication timestamps.
next_actions:
- Resolve the exact post-Lens browser proof gate without bypass; source9c6bef3f37f9,
  expected-input receipt and unchanged failed first-click assertion are preserved.
- Resolve existing source-clock and automatic-weight-supply gates;15 pending clock
  tests remain excluded; do not reimplement refused operations through another actor.
- When release work resumes, qualify then-current source/CI and accepted production
  publication; do not restart or overwrite PR7592/6860 owners.
do_not_redo:
- Do not change PR7592 or restart its reviewer or CI as part of this feature slice.
- Do not lower94 by judgment or infer whole-market collapse, index contributions,
  forecast probability or trade authority from this context.
- Do not call the arithmetic sample mean an equal-weight index or relative outperformance
  an absolute gain.
- Do not create a new collector, participation tape, queue, scheduler or risk engine.
- Do not re-fetch or redistribute the official workbook to repeat this accepted retrospective
  result; do not call the basket official index attribution or treat its later observation
  as PIT evidence.
danger_areas:
- Missing quotes cannot be filled from earlier observations; every return window needs
  its own sufficient history.
- Trend changes must use the same eligible names at both endpoints.
- Daily traded-board and multiday library samples have different coverage and horizons.
- Offline builds can alter local generated files; preserve proof and restore only
  this operation's generated artifacts before committing source.

# Current cumulative continuation
Operation:china-participation-context-20260921-sol-001; same PR7622 source custody.
Procedure:Mastermind@0471cea4f891da1ec0c9fbeff10a9391f9cdd90f, compatible1.0.1/bootstrap1.
Chairman continues accuracy work; CI/release deferred, Draft/HOLD unchanged.
DO_NOT_REDO:combined7592 integrity, participation/cohort/optional weight consumers,
missing-member explanation, source-current72bb integration and incumbent6860.

New source:e91a7313dc4635b013e162affbf049984c2dbc61 changes16 text literals only in
china_playbook. Four quadrant definitions separate model directions from economic
levels; four bilingual regime reasons no longer certify a bottom, hit rate or entry.
373 tests pass across4 owning suites;50 new cases, including12 RED before repair.
405 synthetic old/new scenarios preserve numeric/posture outputs and non-regime
reasons. Non-string AST identical. The actual full-page Jinja dialog is covered.
Evidence:research/grey_deer/CHINA_REGIME_COPY_20260922.json; current research section
in research/grey_deer/CHINA_INTEGRATED_CONTEXT_20260921.md.

The normal offline builder returned0 but recomputed derived latest.json:19 leaves
changed under conditions/fear_euphoria/market_drivers. The input assertion caught
this, so its refreshed page was NOT accepted/published. Its artifact/diff remain
operation-local;27 owned generated files were restored. Six pinned input/ledger
files and the existing page a7b1ea68... are byte-identical to their original state.
Do not claim the changed analytical readings were caused by text or validated.

Frozen gates:post-Lens browser refusal; original clock edit/15 pending cases;
protective automatic-weight-supply append; prior7029 review; weight name/residual
augmentation. This turn's distinct macro-detail/latest-payload read was refused;
it was not rerouted. Later reads reconciled the actual builder effect on its own carrier.
No effect uncertainty, worker, watcher, fresh collection, policy or deployment.

Next:qualify the raw-input/derived-summary vintage difference before accepting a
new rendered page, then exact original platform gates and normal release proof.
Intended resume:fresh conversation, this current same-PR checkpoint plus fresh INDEX.
CHECKPOINTED_CONTINUATION; MISSION_COMPLETE:false. Context-heavy source-and-artifact
phase preserved; source custody is retained, not transferred or automatically awakened.
