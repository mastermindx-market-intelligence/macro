workstream: WS:RATES-INFLATION-COMMAND
session: sol/ric-recovery-20260827
model: sol
ended_because: complete
mission: >
  Cold-start under the protected Sol Skillpack, reconstruct Chairman intent and current Rates &
  Inflation / Macro Release Intelligence truth, freeze canonical ownership and the full production
  completion graph, and prevent the program from disappearing into stale masterplan status or
  dead-letter Fable dispatch.
state_before: >
  The July RIC masterplan still described W5/W6 and later waves as missing, but W7 had subsequently
  landed, later Transmission Intelligence changed W6 ownership, Macro Release Intelligence had
  undergone a major target/provenance reset, and no durable Agent OS RIC workstream existed. Slack
  contained no RIC carrier/ACK. Current implementation also contained a hidden stale seam:
  engine/opex_risk.py still treated W4 event collision as not built and always null.
changed:
  - path: research/RATES_INFLATION_COMMAND_RECOVERY_AND_COMPLETION_FREEZE_2026-08-27.md
    what: >
      Froze the recovered 10/10 product thesis, capability ledger, stale/false records, canonical
      ownership/no-rebuild law, F0-F7 completion graph, exact first RIC-F1/F2/F3 commission packets,
      claimed-vs-unclaimed state and final production acceptance contract.
  - path: agentos/decisions/DEC-RIC-CANONICAL-COMPOSITION-BOUNDARIES.md
    what: >
      Records that RIC must compose/extend MRI, event_calendar, ThetaData/options_surface,
      canonical Transmission, Fed/policy, Risk and existing learning/evaluation rather than fork them.
  - path: agentos/discoveries/DSC-RIC-RECOVERY-FOUND-STATUS-DRIFT-AND-W3-W4-DISCONNECT.md
    what: >
      Records the load-bearing status drift, W3/W4 disconnect, MRI evidence reset, Forward Path
      semantic staleness and committed-history-vs-live-ops distinction.
  - path: agentos/workstreams/WS-RATES-INFLATION-COMMAND.md
    what: >
      Establishes the durable CEO-owned F0-F7 workstream frontier so future sessions recover by
      capability/dependency rather than stale W-number labels.
verified:
  - claim: Protected Sol Skillpack is current and compatible for this recovery.
    command: "Read protected Mastermind master and docs/sol_skills/INDEX.md + required skills from exact SHA"
    result: >
      Protected Mastermind master was 6f1bc3dd39f1ebecd3c22e44aa11ca7a13fa5182 at both bootstrap and
      action-time revalidation; bootstrap_major=1 is compatible.
  - claim: Current Macro base used for the recovery carrier is newer than the initial archaeology base.
    command: "Read macro main branch immediately before opening the records carrier"
    result: >
      main advanced from e857fedd7818505dd08a30e7a9058d08c55f7b21 to
      0758de6b9a7e9e920a6f44e4c1abcd62dbf8074e via unrelated PR #6533; recovery carrier was based
      on the newer head.
  - claim: No open RIC/Rates/Inflation/OPEX/release carrier existed at commission freeze time.
    command: "Direct GitHub open-PR search on macro plus Slack #agent-dispatch RIC/rates/inflation search"
    result: >
      No matching open RIC carrier and no RIC/rates/inflation dispatch message after 2026-08-26 were found.
  - claim: W3 OPEX risk is disconnected from W4 event-window context on recovered main lineage.
    command: "Read engine/opex_risk.py and engine/event_window.py"
    result: >
      opex_risk hard-codes states['event_collision']=None and says W4 is not yet built while
      event_window.py exists.
  - claim: MRI forecast efficacy is currently experimental/withheld, not a proven continuation of old backtests.
    command: "Read data/release_forecast/latest.json and current MRI masterplan/recent merged repairs"
    result: >
      Current methodology reports legacy cross-vintage target epoch experimental, coherent current
      projection n=0, clean forward CPI n=0 and accuracy claim withheld pending aligned forward evidence.
  - claim: Canonical rate/inflation transmission already exists and has no scored authority.
    command: "Read engine/rate_inflation_transmission.py, data/transmission/latest.json and current TXI masterplan"
    result: >
      Existing Transmission publishes measured multi-asset pass-through/context and explicitly says
      its scored gate found no robust leg fit for authority; building a second causal brain is rejected.
  - claim: Forward Path is only partial despite a fresh artifact.
    command: "Read engine/rates_inflation_command.py and data/rates_command/latest.json"
    result: >
      The board exists but current artifact includes component policy intel as-of 2026-07-13 / 44 days
      stale and it shipped before the missing RIC yield/Transmission composition was complete.
  - claim: Current Autonomy law does not permit absent-recipient Fable delivery to count as execution.
    command: "Read Macro #6509 Autonomy reconciliation and current Slack #agent-dispatch state"
    result: >
      Slack is transport/attention, not a Job queue; a concrete canonical runtime/session ACK is required
      before a lane is active. No such RIC ACK was found.
unverified:
  - claim: Current theta-ops options-surface producer is advancing on the production host.
    what_would_verify: exact current production liveness/freshness receipt from the canonical theta lane plus real consumer proof.
  - claim: Current public/authenticated Rates & Inflation surfaces render the latest recovered artifacts end-to-end.
    what_would_verify: current real-browser proof at relevant breakpoints using the production path and fresh source receipts.
  - claim: MRI coherent-target challengers improve on lawful benchmarks.
    what_would_verify: matured clean aligned forward evidence under the frozen epoch and manual promotion adjudication.
  - claim: Dealer-load-extreme is promotable.
    what_would_verify: ">=12 months forward history plus every frozen preregistered lift/HAC/permutation gate; earliest approximately 2027-07."
unresolved:
  - "PR #6543 requires independent review/CI/merge before F0 becomes accepted durable truth."
  - "Current theta surface liveness is unproven by committed history alone."
  - "Historical CPI/PPI/NFP event-window coverage needs canonical PIT release-date repair."
  - "Yield-series momentum organ is missing."
  - "Forward Path must remove semantic-stale policy input and compose the missing canonical yield/transmission reads."
  - "Unified premium RIC UX and aggregate evidence/scorecard remain nonterminal."
next_actions:
  - "Independently review and merge PR #6543 only if Agent OS validation/semantic CI are green on its exact head."
  - "After F0 acceptance, submit RIC-F1 Release/Event Truth & Intelligence through canonical Executive admission/routing; require concrete carrier/session ACK before active."
  - "In parallel after F0, submit RIC-F2 Dealer/OPEX State and RIC-F3 Yield/Canonical Transmission as disjoint operations with the same ACK requirement."
  - "Sol then adversarially reviews each returned PR against the frozen end-state and real-input production proof before releasing F4/F5/F6/F7 dependencies."
do_not_redo:
  - "Do not recreate release/calendar/options/transmission/policy/risk/learning/lifecycle planes."
  - "Do not interpret committed options history as current liveness."
  - "Do not cite superseded MRI legacy backtests as current efficacy."
  - "Do not wire event/OPEX proximity into Risk Radar ranking/scoring/sizing/gating."
  - "Do not create a DGS20 collector; consume CCW us20y."
  - "Do not call a Slack post, Agent OS claim, branch or PR an active worker session."
danger_areas:
  - "File freshness can hide semantic staleness, as proven by the 44-day-old policy component inside a fresh rates_command artifact."
  - "The July masterplan remains useful product law but its wave status is stale; always re-archaeologize current owners before implementation."
  - "W3's user-facing copy contains directional-sounding hold/ease language despite context-only authority; future UX review must ensure wording cannot launder authority."
  - "Clean forward evidence clocks must not be backfilled retrospectively after target/provenance corrections."

# Return point

The recovery is complete; the product program is not. F1/F2/F3 are frozen but unclaimed until the
canonical Executive/worker path produces real carriers and receiver ACKs. F4-F7 are not yet
commissioned. Sol remains the end-to-end owner and must review capability completion, not merely code
quality, before each dependency is released.
