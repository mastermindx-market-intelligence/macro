unverified:
  - claim: The launchd primary fires and publishes by ~16:10 ET on a live session
    what_would_verify: Monday 2026-08-17 16:00 ET firing + scripts/close_pass_slo_report.py
  - claim: Snapshot day.c settles to the official close within minutes of a LIVE bell
    what_would_verify: Monday 16:01-16:20 ET polls vs next-day grouped (DSC falsifier command)
unresolved:
  - "16:15 ET product SLO vs measured ~7-8 min single-threaded collect: first live sessions decide whether W-L2 parallelization is required for the SLO or only for comfort."
  - "Arming-budget coverage (88/3,046 armed, probe_cap_cross 2,764) — W-L2."
next_actions:
  - "Verify #5760/#5761 merged; rebase from lane worktrees agent-a32af4cc3baeb108d / agent-a6a3be5eb79bcc32f if a re-run goes DIRTY"
  - "After #5760: bash scripts/install_closepass_launchd.sh from fresh main; launchctl print gui/$UID/com.macro.closepass; dry-run kickstart with --now 2026-08-14T20:26:00Z; confirm run receipt"
  - "After #5761: verify sentinel armed-pack surface on the VPS within ~33 min; run close_pass_slo_report.py --sessions 3"
  - "Monday 2026-08-17: W-ACCEPT session 1 of 3 — grade close→candidate→visible; GH lane must stand down"
do_not_redo:
  - "Do not rebuild the close observation on Yahoo — Massive grouped/snapshot is primary (DEC), Yahoo heal remains index-group store fallback only"
  - "Do not craft replay/rescue artifacts as bare {board_state:...} shells — the client refuses them; annotate the real evaluator doc like close_pass_mirror"
  - "Do not upper-case vendor tickers before joins (DSC:MASSIVE-TICKER-CASE-IS-IDENTITY); census of remaining sites is chipped (task_6fb8d4c3)"
  - "Do not add a VPS board-compute tier or a websocket — DEC alternatives close both until W-L2 evidence"
danger_areas:
  - "close-pass.yml carries THREE lanes' reasoning in comments (schedule, ledger law, backstop) — edit surgically, tests pin the shape"
  - "Two writers on live/prophet_live.json via CAS — never add a third"
  - "The lane worktree .claude/worktrees/closepass-host-lane is created by raw git (FULL checkout, data/ included) — the sparse hook does not govern it; GC is held off by its lock"

## Session shape (for the stranger)

One Fable orchestrator; three Opus builders + one Opus red-team spawned in
parallel worktrees. The account's 5-hour window capped mid-build and killed all
three agents; the orchestrator absorbed their work serially — finished PR-B's
last deliverable, shipped PR-C's completed-but-unpushed commit, completed the
red-team checklist itself — and ran the browser replay end-to-end. Cost of the
detour: ~2 hours. Nothing was rebuilt from scratch; the loss-proof mid-flight
handoff (#5758) is superseded by the close version of the same file.
