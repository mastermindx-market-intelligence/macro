mission: >
  Adjudicate the frozen EXK H0-H4/H1B/H4B rules on canonical repository prices,
  stop contaminated or underpowered inference, and freeze the first untouched
  cross-issuer Dislocation P0 program without creating production authority.
state_before: >
  Turn 3 had a compiled replay engine, 23-transition EXK census and February 2026
  failure control, but no canonical binary execution. It treated SLV as required,
  had not proven price-store coverage, and proposed a 10/20-session relative
  confirmation rule from design-touched EXK episodes.

unverified:

  - claim: "Full 2016-2026 EXK pattern."
    what_would_verify: "A canonical provenance-compatible benchmark history; completion would remain descriptive because EXK is design-touched."
unresolved:
  - "Which canonical owner supplies the price-blind official-document extraction reader for non-earnings 8-K/6-K and Canadian releases."
  - "Whether P0 honest-N floors are reachable without rights-blocked or famous/design-touched cases."
  - "Whether matched-k and sc-nnls agree sufficiently on the eventual panel."
next_actions:
  - "Operator/Fable dispatches the Grok P0 blind-extraction commission."
  - "Fable commissions a separate source auditor and freezes the accepted manifest/trial ledger."
  - "A different runner executes P0; no extractor may see outcomes before freeze."
  - "Return the K-packet to Sol before any K5 integration or live surface."
do_not_redo:
  - "Do not retune EXK lookbacks, wait, hold or stop from Turn-1–4 outcomes."
  - "Do not externally backfill SIL/SLV inside the canonical EXK study."
  - "Do not count adverse pulses as independent origins."
  - "Do not infer orchestration/manipulation."
  - "Do not build a standalone Dislocation Score, workstream, event store, ranker or grader."
danger_areas:
  - "Event extractor must be technically unable to access prices/outcomes; prompt-only blindness is insufficient for confirmatory integrity."
  - "No-entry in P0 is cash/abstention, while refused/ungradable is missing with a named reason; never collapse them."
  - "Matched-k defines confirmation; sc-nnls estimates outcomes. Fusing them or selecting the favorable estimator invalidates P0."
  - "The 2025 steel-delay case proves a relative breakout is not a sufficient recovery condition."

## Exact return point

Read the DEC, DSC, Turn-4 adjudication and P0 prereg. Start from the frozen blind
manifest and source audit. Do not reopen EXK chart interpretation.
