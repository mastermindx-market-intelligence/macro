mission: >
  Durably record Sol's final review and acceptance of the D6-B1 coverage-aware
  FMS production vertical. This handoff records acceptance and the exact
  post-acceptance authorization boundary only. It does not authorize D6-C,
  D7, GAO, DOT&E, IG, or any later defense rail.
state_before: >
  D6-B was marked done and production-proven in AgentOS after closing records
  PR #6480 / merge cca7d6b7c51c9cda6347097281ff050c2fe551ff, but the
  workstream remained awaiting_review pending Sol's acceptance. The complete
  implementation/proof chain was #6447 -> #6454 -> #6478 -> #6480. D5 remained
  BUILT_NOT_PROVEN under the Chairman's sequencing waiver, and D6-C+/D7+
  remained unauthorized.

    what: >
      Records the Sol PASS, immutable CI/acquisition/publication receipts,
      explicit U4/Federal-Register supersession ruling, State-web coverage
      ruling, nonblocking reliability debt, and the parked authorization
      boundary after D6-B. Acceptance projection carrier is Macro PR #6485.

      Protected Mastermind master was
      abb64e9e1dcedea39d5dc7e1dc32495449630531 at the records-carrier re-pin.
      INDEX.md, REVIEW_RETURN.md, RECONCILE_STATE.md and CLOSEOUT.md were
      loaded from that exact SHA. Skillpack mastermind.sol_skillpack.v1 was
      v1.0.0 with minimum bootstrap major 1, compatible with Chairman bootstrap
      major 1. The canonical Sol acceptance comment had already been issued
      under the prior compatible protected pin
      98f60ddcd2e387ea42c23f64b66933650c4f2e19; later compatible protected
      revisions were reloaded before AgentOS merge work and introduced no
      compatibility or closeout-law conflict.

      Claim-time Macro main 851e660cce363778d20b66dcf816a76cea9dffc2
      was 64 commits ahead of the #6480 closeout merge with no FMS
      implementation/data/product path drift and no Defense Procurement
      workstream drift. Later changes were unrelated fleet CI/governance and
      bot/data surfaces.

      98f8c389dbc83df0fd400d035eeea7a1697186c1 succeeded and pushed
      d90d63c782668c6adfa9697563349412292153ae with exactly the collector-owned
      FMS files changed. It built 83 immutable observations, 83 receipts and
      66 canonical cases. Coverage official_union_v1 reconciled 57/57 Federal
      Register denominator transmittals with denominator_unbuilt=[] plus nine
      State-frontier web-only cases; 123 pre-window FR originals were explicit
      out_of_scope_originals under the delivered-to-Congress population clock.

      estimated_notification_value is a proposed-sale estimate and never an
      award, backlog, revenue or cash amount; v1 stage stops at
      congressional_notification and elapsed time never advances it.

      26-13 Saudi is present with DSCA/certification plus FR evidence and the
      exact Congressional-delivery clock; 26-23 Jordan and 26-28 Japan remain
      canonical despite State/DSCA web absence; 26-27 Sweden remains canonical
      with exact FR delivered-to-Congress provenance. Duplicate source copies
      dedupe by transmittal. State-frontier cases preserve null official
      notification dates rather than inventing a lifecycle clock.

      publish commit 5d9628af92c2ad0097b39ec3da2af1f78f8c7e0a. The #6480
      close packet banks canonical/public FMS twin byte equality, Caddy-served
      equality, production in-process canaries, anonymous API 401 / locked twin
      with zero case bodies, zero FMS government_procurement_event.v2 rows, and
      EN/ZH desktop plus 375px mobile rendering.

      D7+ unauthorized.
unverified: []
unresolved:
  - >
    Page-fence pressure remains high: the accepted production page is 302,713
    bytes against the 303,104-byte fence, leaving 391 bytes. No silent fence
    bump is authorized; future growth must shrink or return for an explicit
    ratchet ruling.
  - >
    fms-acquire itself has no bounded commit-back retry. One earlier production
    run lost a push race, while the canonical publisher's existing guarded
    retry later proved successful. Do not add blind retry, auto-failover, or a
    second publication lane; any acquisition retry design is separate
    reliability work.
  - >
    State hosted-runner edge variance remains real. State current presentation
    is staged from SHA-frozen residentially acquired official bytes and R2
    strict-readback; refresh cadence and freshness.fms cadence remain later
    reliability rulings. Continuous-live State freshness is not claimed.
  - >
    The pre-existing /government-revenue-data/ premium.enforced_early
    configuration gap remains separate. D6-B acceptance covers the proved
    production boundary with anonymous APIs 401 and the FMS twin locked; it
    does not certify every hypothetical deployment-flag combination.
  - >
    Shared graph-validator duplication and future Starlette/http migration are
    technical debt, not D6-B correctness blockers.
sol_rulings:
  acceptance: >
    D6-B1 / D6-B ACCEPTED / PROVEN_LIVE. D5 remains BUILT_NOT_PROVEN.
    D6-C+, D7+, GAO, DOT&E, IG and every later defense rail remain
    UNAUTHORIZED. This acceptance starts no new wave.
  u4_official_union: >
    RATIFIED. The D6-B1 U4 official-union law supersedes only the older D6-B0
    U3 clause that Federal Register could not mint a case. An in-scope original
    36(b)(1) Federal Register record may recover/mint the canonical FMS
    notification case when State/DSCA web surfaces omit it. Federal Register
    does not mint a later lifecycle stage, LOA, funding, obligation, award,
    backlog, revenue, cash, issuer identity, D5 program identity, ranking,
    sizing, gating, signal origination, or Prophet authority.
  state_web_presence: >
    RATIFIED. State and DSCA web presence are observational coverage, not
    population authority. The earlier expectation that 26-27 remain a positive
    current-State-web case is superseded only to the extent it would require
    fabricating present-day State web presence. The required canonical truth is
    the positive official notification with its exact Federal Register
    delivered-to-Congress clock; current State absence remains explicit.
  state_staged_transport: >
    RATIFIED for v1. current_presentation_staged / residential staged State
    transport is acceptable because hosted-runner challenge bytes were
    production-observed, staged official bytes are SHA-frozen and R2
    strict-readback, and a zero-qualifying State capture refuses instead of
    publishing VALID_EMPTY. This is not a claim of continuous-live State
    freshness.
  page_fence: >
    Current 302,713-byte production page passes the existing 303,104-byte
    ratchet. The 391-byte residual headroom is a named danger area; no fence
    increase is authorized by this acceptance.
next_actions:
  - >
    Park WS:DEFENSE-PROCUREMENT-V3 at the accepted D6-B boundary. Do not start
    D6-C, D7, GAO, DOT&E, IG or another defense rail unless the Chairman/Sol
    explicitly commissions the next bounded wave after fresh current-state and
    collision reconciliation.
  - >
    Preserve D5 as BUILT_NOT_PROVEN until a real entitled D5P browser journey
    occurs; D6-B proof cannot upgrade it.
  - >
    Reliability debts listed above may be separately proposed, but none gains
    authority to widen the accepted FMS product or create a duplicate retry,
    publication, event, identity, or source plane.
do_not_redo:
  - Do not reopen D6-B0 or redo the D6-B1 planning census/red-team repair.
  - Do not restore State/DSCA web surfaces as an exclusive population rule.
  - Do not infer later FMS lifecycle stage from elapsed review time.
  - Do not sum estimated_notification_value across cases or relabel it as funded value, award, backlog, revenue or cash.
  - Do not create FMS government_procurement_event.v2 rows, award_change rows, a second event store, or a separate FMS app.
  - Do not mint issuer identity from contractor prose or D5 program links from system-name similarity.
  - Do not move defense-rail-laws back to gate:data; D6-A/D6-B1 law batteries remain merge-binding gate:code.
  - Do not start D6-C+, D7+, GAO, DOT&E or IG from this acceptance.
danger_areas:
  - Keep official-union recovery authority distinct from lifecycle advancement or economic realization.
  - Keep State staged presentation honest about its acquisition time and non-exhaustive coverage.
  - Keep the 303,104-byte page fence binding; 391 bytes of headroom is not spare product budget.
  - Keep acquisition retry design separate from the already-canonical publisher retry lane.
  - Keep D5's deferred proof gap visible; sequencing waiver is not proof.
return_point: >
  Highest-authority acceptance receipt is Macro PR #6480 comment 5432443653.
  Acceptance projection carrier is Macro PR #6485. Closing records carrier is
  #6480 / merge cca7d6b7c51c9cda6347097281ff050c2fe551ff. Final production
  acquisition commit is d90d63c782668c6adfa9697563349412292153ae; canonical
  publication commit is 5d9628af92c2ad0097b39ec3da2af1f78f8c7e0a. Records-carrier
  Skillpack re-pin is
  Mastermind@abb64e9e1dcedea39d5dc7e1dc32495449630531; the canonical Sol
  acceptance comment preserves its original review pin
  Mastermind@98f60ddcd2e387ea42c23f64b66933650c4f2e19.
