mission: >
  Execute the price-blind Dislocation P0-S1F source-precision experiment on the
  sole existing draft PR #6334 carrier: freeze a fresh exact seventy in seven
  predetermined strata, replay canonical SEC owner bytes, run fresh source-only
  proposals and an independent audit of all seventy, perform all-seventy economic
  relationship linkage, emit honest-N measurement and a K-packet, and stop before
  P0-S2 with no price, outcome, counterfactual, ranking, sizing, or execution path.
state_before: >
  Accepted P0-A1R had yielded one admissible episode from twenty source packets, but
  that yield did not establish whether the frozen FTS source law had adequate
  precision. Sol commissioned a prospective seventy-packet source-only experiment.
  PR #6334 already carried the frozen selection, canonical owner replay, shadow
  triage, and seven fresh Grok proposal batches. The independent audit and final
  all-seventy reconciliation were incomplete. The original commission named Claude
  Web/Opus, but the Chairman later prohibited that low-limit account and specifically
  directed the existing carrier to use Warp with Grok 4.6 instead.

      Records the later Chairman ruling that only the independent runtime changes:
      seven isolated Warp/Oz Grok 4.6 audits plus a separate all-seventy reconciliation;
      frozen source, ontology, measurement, authority and P0-S2 stop law remain intact.

      Names the actual xAI/Grok 4.6 independent auditor, exact disagreement schema,

# Dislocation P0-S1F cold-session return point

The source-only experiment is complete and uncomfortable in exactly the useful way:
the frozen FTS law retrieved seventy canonical packets, but independent semantic audit
and genuine all-seventy linkage admitted **zero** economic episodes. That is a result,
not a request for top-ups.

The sole independently useful capability is the immutable price-blind feasibility
packet. A future reviewer can inspect the full proposal, independent audit, relationship
reconciliation, linkage, disagreement matrix, measurement and K-packet directly from
the tracked `research/dislocation_intelligence/p0_s1f/` artifacts, then verify their
runtime and batch-input hashes through the final receipt graph.

## Continuation ruling

Sol accepts the S1F semantic, source, audit and measurement result for adjudication.
After the prospective experiment returned 0/70 economic origins and 0/18 retained
precision, the frozen Turn-5 **phrase-first candidate-discovery lane is
`REJECTED_BY_DESIGN` for P0-S2**. This rejects the source-discovery method, not the
Dislocation economic thesis, canonical SEC source owners, evidence/audit machinery,
or P0 preregistration.

The next potential research wave would be a new logical operation and new carrier for
an event-first, still-price-blind source-law experiment. It is not authorized to start
in PR #6334. Preserve the PR #6258 and PR #6334 packets as immutable
source-development and falsification evidence. PR #6117 remains
`QUARANTINED_UNAUDITED`; do not unquarantine it.

Stop here. Sol is the only release and next-wave authority.
