  Execute Sol's 2026-08-22 commission "P1-R2 — ANNOUNCEMENT-ID INTEGRITY": make it
  impossible for a missing/blank/NaN/whitespace announcementId to be silently
  deduplicated, discarded, or converted into clean absence authority, at BOTH the
  collectors/china_filings.py write boundary and the collectors/china_visits.py
  candidate boundary. Bounded scope: those two collectors, their directly owning
  tests, and minimal Agent OS reconciliation. Sol's dictated post-merge state:
  "PARTIAL / normal-path PROVEN_LIVE, malformed-key repair BUILT_NOT_PROVEN".
state_before: >
  P1 was accepted DONE / PROVEN_LIVE on 2026-08-21 (Sol P1 NATURAL-RUN ADJUDICATION,
  closeout PR #6215, squash f156b073414a37eed006b6aee86d8ce3054946d1) on natural
  asia-close run 32460910383 with an exact 145-candidate reconciliation. That
  acceptance rested on POSITIVE evidence — 145 of 145 candidates carried a distinct
  non-falsy announcementId — not on the absence of a hole. The hole itself was named
  and deliberately left unrepaired in that session because Sol's adjudication said
  "Do not independently widen the implementation", and was recorded as
  DSC:CHINA-VISITS-UNTYPED-ANNOUNCEMENT-ID-DROP pending its own commission. Two
  silent-drop shapes existed: china_filings.write_filings() ran
  drop_duplicates(subset=["announcementId"]), and pandas treats N rows sharing ""
  as duplicates of EACH OTHER, so N malformed rows collapsed into ONE with no
  counter; china_visits.refresh() used a bare comprehension
  `[_derive_row(f, ts) for f in candidates if f.get("announcementId")]` with no typed
  exclusion, no counter and no health note, while n_candidates kept counting the
  PRE-filter list.
changed:
  - path: collectors/china_filings.py
    what: >
      Added the pure, never-raising key predicate the whole repair rests on —
      key_anomaly() (returns one of the frozen names missing/nan/empty/whitespace,
      or None), normalize_announcement_id(), partition_by_key_integrity(). Added the
      process-local LAST_KEY_INTEGRITY global (never persisted, reset fail-closed at
      fetch() entry, canonical shape excluded_total/excluded_by_type/
      preexisting_unkeyed/at). write_filings() now partitions new_rows on that
      predicate BEFORE any dedup, so malformed rows are a typed COUNTED exclusion
      instead of a drop_duplicates collapse; splits the ACCRUED store with a
      vectorized mask and writes any pre-existing unkeyed row back VERBATIM, never
      subjecting it to the keyed dedup; computes net_new off the keyed frames only;
      and goes loud via log.error plus a bare line-start
      ::warning GitHub annotation. _parse_announcement() now leaves an absent
      announcementId as None ("missing") instead of flattening it to "" ("empty").
      fetch() folds LAST_KEY_INTEGRITY into LAST_RUN_OUTCOME["key_integrity"] on
      both exit paths and appends a typed errors[] entry so ok degrades to False —
      without touching the single raise condition, so the Asia lane stays fail-soft.
  - path: collectors/china_visits.py
    what: >
      account_candidates() replaces the bare comprehension with an explicit typed
      split using the SAME key_anomaly predicate imported from china_filings (never
      re-derived here, so the two boundaries cannot silently diverge); it also
      returns up to 5 excluded_identities formatted sec_code|publish_ts|title[:60],
      log/annotation only, because an excluded row has no announcementId to name it
      by. refresh() mechanically verifies `represented + typed_exclusions ==
      eligible` as an explicit branch and refuses to write anything on a mismatch.
      The collectors.china_filings import that supplies the predicate is now
      fail-closed (import failure degrades to source_failure instead of deriving
      blind). Typed exclusions type the run "upstream_degraded" with success=False,
      and when a degraded same-run china_filings outcome fires too, ONE record's
      detail names BOTH causes distinctly. _write_health() gained an optional
      keyword-only accounting param persisted as an additive candidate_accounting
      field, written on the clean path as well as the degraded one. refresh()'s
      return dict keeps status/n_candidates/n_new and adds n_represented/
      n_excluded/exclusions.
  - path: collectors/china_filings.py (adversarial-review repairs)
    what: >
      Four further repairs, all found by an opus reviewer attacking the diff before
      merge. (1) fetch() no longer laundered an UNKNOWN key-integrity reading into a
      clean one: LAST_KEY_INTEGRITY stays None when write_filings() fails
      internally, and `None or zeros` was silently folding in excluded_total=0 with
      ok=True, so a batch whose store write blew up certified itself clean and
      china_visits stamped coverage over it. (2) _read_filings_strict() now
      distinguishes an ABSENT store from a present-but-UNREADABLE one, and
      write_filings() ABORTS on the latter instead of replacing the entire accrued
      tape with tonight's batch — measured, a 500-row store became 1 row while every
      instrument read clean. This mirrors the strict-read + ABORT pattern
      collectors/china_visits.py has carried since P1. (3) The natural key is
      canonicalized through normalize_announcement_id() at the write boundary, so
      " 1234567 " and "1234567" are one row rather than two, and a non-scalar key
      can no longer raise inside drop_duplicates and lose the whole batch silently.
      (4) normalize_announcement_id() no longer raises on an un-stringable value.
  - path: tests/test_china_filings_collector.py
    what: >
      Added TestKeyAnomaly (18 cases), TestNormalizeAnnouncementId,
      TestPartitionByKeyIntegrity, TestWriteFilingsKeyIntegrity and
      TestKeyIntegrityMutationGuard — covering every value in Sol's hostile list
      plus pre-existing-unkeyed preservation and a mutation guard proving the
      exclusion depends on the real predicate rather than on the test's own logic.
  - path: tests/test_china_visits_collector.py
    what: >
      Added TestAccountCandidates, TestRefreshKeyIntegrity,
      TestMeasuredAbsenceCannotAdvance, TestAccountingMutationGuard and
      TestVisitBlockUpstreamDegradedP1R2 — including a keyless institutional-visit
      row already present in the filings store (proving the visits boundary defends
      independently of china_filings), valid rows preserved beside malformed ones,
      lane-survives-health-loud, and the dossier reading "stale" rather than
      "measured_no_event" end to end.
  - path: agentos/decisions/DEC-CHINA-KEY-INTEGRITY-TYPED-EXCLUSION.md
    what: >
      New. Records why one shared predicate owned by the natural-key module, why a
      typed exclusion rather than a silent drop or a keyless append, and the three
      rejected alternatives — a fallback composite key (forbidden new identity
      system), an unbounded keyless append, and a fifth _HEALTH_STATES value.
  - path: agentos/discoveries/DSC-CHINA-VISITS-UNTYPED-ANNOUNCEMENT-ID-DROP.md
    what: >
      Appended a "REPAIRED BY P1-R2" body paragraph naming what changed at both
      boundaries. Frontmatter claim/falsifier/so_what deliberately untouched — they
      record what was true when the discovery was verified.
  - path: agentos/workstreams/WS-CHINA-ALPHA-INTELLIGENCE.md
    what: >
      Added the p1r2 wave (status in_progress, depends_on [p1]) carrying Sol's
      dictated post-merge state verbatim and the standing gate. The existing p1
      wave is untouched — it is a Sol-accepted receipt.
verified:
  - claim: The malformed-announcementId path has fired ZERO times in production, so
      this is a rare-branch repair proven by hostile fixtures rather than by a
      naturally occurring malformed row.
    command: >
      git cat-file -p origin/main:data/china_filings/filings.parquet piped into
      pandas.read_parquet, then counting isna() and the non-na rows whose
      astype("string").str.strip() == "" (scratchpad census_keys.py)
    result: >
      54,078 rows; 0 NaN/None; 0 empty-or-whitespace; 54,078 distinct keys, i.e.
      one distinct key per row.
  - claim: The owning suites are green TOGETHER IN ONE PROCESS, which is the check
      that matters — running them in separate commands hid a module-global leak that
      would have reddened CI.
    command: python3 -m pytest tests/test_china_visits_collector.py tests/test_china_filings_collector.py tests/test_china_intel_hub_visits.py -q
    result: >
      210 passed, 3 warnings in 37.80s. Before the fix this same command produced
      "1 failed, 203 passed" — tests/test_china_intel_hub_visits.py::
      TestLoadVisitsContext::test_after_a_real_refresh_ctx_reflects_it, which passes
      in isolation and fails under the default alphabetical collection order.
  - claim: key_anomaly() never raises and never misclassifies, across the full
      hostile input surface — the property that matters because it runs on every row
      inside the C0 market-critical Asia lane.
    command: >
      scratchpad probe_key_anomaly.py — imports the helper and drives it over 38
      inputs: None, float/np/pd NaN forms, empty, space/tab/newline/U+3000/mixed
      whitespace, normal/int/padded/unicode/np.int64 ids, the literal string "nan",
      bools, 0, and non-scalars (list, dict, tuple, set, 1-d/0-d ndarray, Series,
      DataFrame, Timestamp, bytes, a function, an object whose __str__ raises, an
      object whose __eq__ raises)
    result: >
      FAILURES: 0. Every malformed form classified, every well-formed value passed,
      nothing raised. The literal string "nan" correctly reads well-formed, which is
      the observable proof that the NaN check runs BEFORE any str() coercion.
      The first run of this probe DID find one defect — normalize_announcement_id()
      raised RuntimeError on an object with a raising __str__ — now guarded and
      pinned by a mutation-guard test.
  - claim: The vectorized accrued-store split preserves history across repeated
      nightly writes and cannot truncate or duplicate the tape.
    command: >
      scratchpad probe_mask.py — seeds a store already holding 2 unkeyed rows,
      performs 3 consecutive nightly writes re-pulling the same keyed rows, then an
      all-malformed batch, then a write against a deliberately non-contiguous index
    result: >
      Unkeyed rows stay 2 across all 3 nights (preserved, not duplicated, not
      collapsed); keyed history intact with no duplicates; columns identical to the
      schema; an all-malformed batch leaves the store at 7 rows with net_new 0; the
      non-contiguous-index write adds exactly 1 row, so mask alignment is correct.
      The same run also demonstrated the permanent-latch property recorded under
      `unresolved` — integrity read 0 excluded / 2 pre-existing on every one of the
      three otherwise-clean nights.
  - claim: The surfaces that guard or consume the touched code did not regress.
    command: python3 -m pytest tests/test_china_intel_hub_visits.py tests/test_nightly_timings.py tests/test_gh_annotation_line_start.py -q

    command: python3 scripts/agentos.py validate
    result: >
      517 records (44 workstreams, 167 decisions, 140 discoveries, 166 handoffs) —
      0 error(s), 26 warning(s), all 26 pre-existing on unrelated records.
  - claim: Splitting the accrued store with a vectorized mask is ~45x cheaper than
      the to_dict("records") round-trip and preserves every column dtype, which is
      why write_filings() uses the mask.
    command: >
      scratchpad bench_partition.py — reads the real 54,078-row store from
      origin/main via git cat-file, times partition_by_key_integrity(

      key_anomaly).notna(), and diffs the resulting dtypes against the original
    result: >

    what_would_verify: >
      The next natural asia-close.yml run containing this merge: confirm the `asia`
      JOB conclusion is success (not merely the run — early cron slots conclude
      run-success with the asia job SKIPPED), that china_filings -> china_visits
      still run back to back in the same invocation with china_visits at ~0.0s and
      zero network, that data/china_visits/health.json reads status ok with the new
      candidate_accounting field present and eligible == represented_downstream,
      and that LAST_RUN_OUTCOME carried key_integrity with excluded_total 0. This is
      the ONLY remaining P1-R2 proof lane, and Sol scoped it explicitly to
      deployment/no-regression — a naturally occurring malformed ID is NOT required.
  - claim: The malformed-key branch itself behaves correctly in production.
    what_would_verify: >
      A real CNInfo payload carrying a malformed announcementId. It has never
      happened (0 of 54,078 rows), so this branch is proven ONLY by the hostile
      fixtures and stays BUILT_NOT_PROVEN indefinitely. Do not wait for it and do
      not manufacture one.
unresolved:
  - >
      A permanent-degradation property that Sol should rule on. Requirement 6 is
      implemented literally and fail-closed: ANY run whose accounting carries a
      typed exclusion writes upstream_degraded and does not advance
      last_success_utc. Because china_filings now PRESERVES a pre-existing unkeyed
      row in the accrued store verbatim (rather than discarding it), a single
      historical malformed institutional_visit row would make china_visits report a
      typed exclusion on EVERY subsequent night, freezing absence authority for the
      whole plane until the store is repaired by hand. That is honest and
      fail-closed, and it cannot fire today (0 malformed rows in 54,078), but it is
      a blunt instrument: one bad upstream row would suppress measured_no_event for
      every A-share name. The alternative — distinguishing "this run encountered a
      malformed key" from "the store contains a historical malformed row" and
      degrading only on the former — was NOT built, because Sol's requirement 6
      names malformed-key CONDITIONS without that split and self-excusing a
      standing condition is exactly the shape this repair exists to prevent.
      Two properties an adversarial review added on 2026-08-22, both confirmed by
      running three consecutive refresh() calls over a store holding one NaN-keyed
      visit row. FIRST: if the malformed row lands BEFORE the plane's first success,
      coverage_start is never stamped, so _visit_block() answers no_coverage for
      every A-share name in the universe and the plane never starts at all — a
      worse state than the frozen-authority one, and equally unexitable. SECOND: the
      coupling is over-broad in the same direction — a malformed announcementId on
      an inquiry_letter row (an unrelated category) degrades LAST_RUN_OUTCOME.ok and
      therefore blacks out the institutional_visit absence plane for that night,
      because requirement 3 routes the anomaly through the shared run outcome. There
      is no in-code exit from either state; today's only remedy is a human editing
      the parquet. Sol should rule on whether requirement 6 was meant to reach this
      far, and if not, the minimal shape is to compute the health verdict's
      typed_exclusions only over candidates inside the current re-pull window while
      still excluding every malformed row from the derived rows.
  - >
      Whether the adversarial review's four extra repairs should have been taken
      inside this commission at all. An opus reviewer attacked the diff before it
      merged and returned FAIL with one blocker and three substantive findings; all
      were fixed here rather than deferred, because each was a case of the same lie
      the commission exists to close (missing data silently reading as clean
      authority) and each sat inside an already-owned file. The judgment call worth
      Sol's attention is the unreadable-store ABORT: it is a real behavior change on
      a path Sol did not name, and it is the one fix that could be argued out of
      scope. It is trivially revertible — delete _read_filings_strict() and restore
      the load_filings() call in write_filings().
next_actions:
  - >
      Report the merged P1-R2 exact head to Sol for review, with the reconciliation
      of what was and was not proven, and the two unresolved items above.
  - >
      On the first natural asia-close.yml run containing this merge, execute the
      deployment/no-regression proof described in the first `unverified` entry.
      Nothing else about P1-R2 is pending.
  - >
      Await Sol's ruling on the permanent-degradation property before changing any
      degradation semantics. Do not soften requirement 6 unilaterally.
do_not_redo:
  - >
      Do NOT re-run or re-derive the P1 145-candidate reconciliation. Sol accepted
      it on 2026-08-21 and explicitly ruled "Do not rerun P1 and do not alter the
      145-row receipt". The receipt is
      research/china_alpha_intelligence/receipts/P1_NATURAL_RUN_RECEIPT_2026-08-21.md
      plus p1_candidate_reconciliation_2026-08-21.tsv.
  - >
      Do NOT add a fifth _HEALTH_STATES value for malformed keys. It was evaluated
      and rejected: engine/china_intel_hub.py's _visit_block() diverts a no-rows
      name away from measured_no_event on the LITERAL string "upstream_degraded"
      only, so a new state falls through that check and renders a degraded run as a
      clean measured absence — the exact silent conversion this repair exists to
      prevent. See DEC:CHINA-KEY-INTEGRITY-TYPED-EXCLUSION.
  - >
      Do NOT mint a fallback/composite announcement id (sec_code+title+date or
      anything similar) for a malformed row, and do NOT append malformed rows to the
      store keyless. The first is a forbidden second identity plane; the second
      grows the store unbounded because the same malformed source row reappears in
      every 3-day re-pull with nothing to dedup against.
  - >
      Do NOT edit engine/china_intel_hub.py to accommodate this repair. The repair
      was deliberately designed to need zero hub changes, and the hub is out of
      scope for the commission.
  - >
      Do NOT start P1B, L0, R1/R2, P2 or any other China Alpha Intelligence family.
      Sol's gate is standing and was restated in this commission. L0 in particular
      still has no bounded builder commission in
      research/china_alpha_intelligence/commissions/ — it must come from Sol, never
      be improvised.
danger_areas:
  - >
      write_filings() REWRITES the entire accrued production parquet on every
      nightly call (54,078 rows today, growing ~2,860/night). Any change to the
      existing_keyed / existing_unkeyed split, the concat order, or the sort is a
      data-loss risk on the whole tape, not just on tonight's batch. The split is
      deliberately a boolean mask over the ORIGINAL frame rather than a
      to_dict("records") round-trip, both for cost and so the frame's own dtypes and
      column order survive untouched.
  - >
      key_anomaly() must NEVER raise, for any input, because it runs inside the C0
      market-critical Asia lane on every row. Two ordering facts are load-bearing:
      the NaN check must run BEFORE any str() coercion (str(float('nan')) == 'nan',
      which would read as a well-formed key), and pd.isna() must be wrapped because
      it returns an ARRAY for list/array-like input whose truth value raises
      ValueError. Never rewrite this function to use a plain `if value:` truth test —
      bool(pd.NA) raises.
  - >
      The mechanical accounting identity in refresh() must stay an explicit `if`
      branch. A bare assert is stripped under python -O, and an AssertionError raised
      inside refresh()'s own broad `except Exception` would be caught and degraded to
      an indistinguishable generic source_failure.
  - >
      The GitHub annotations in both collectors must stay BARE line-start print()
      calls with flush=True. Routing one through the logger prefixes the line, and
      GitHub silently drops it — the call reviews as an alarm, runs clean, and
      produces nothing. Guarded by tests/test_gh_annotation_line_start.py.
  - >
      This worktree is SPARSE: data/, site/, mockups/ and verify_shots/ are absent.
      Never `git add -A` here, and never run the full pytest suite (it yields ~1,700
      artifact failures that mean nothing). Read store bytes with
      `git cat-file -p <rev>:<path>` into an io.BytesIO rather than materializing
      them.

## Why this repair was worth building for a branch that has never fired

Every instrument this plane owns was consistent with a silent drop. `n_candidates`
counted the pre-filter list, `health.json` read `ok`, the workflow concluded
success, and the aggregate row count looked right — a run that dropped k eligible
filings printed exactly the same shape as a run that dropped none. That is why the
2026-08-21 P1 acceptance had to be reconciled per-announcementId from the two
stores at the immutable collection commit: the collector's own receipts could not
answer the question. After P1-R2 they can. `health.json` now carries
`candidate_accounting` with `eligible`, `represented_downstream`, `typed_exclusions`
and `exclusions_by_type` on the clean path as well as the degraded one, so the
identity `represented_downstream + typed_exclusions == eligible` is auditable from
the receipt itself. That is the concrete thing this change bought, and it is worth
more than the rare branch it also closes.

## The one design hinge

Reusing `upstream_degraded` instead of minting a new health state is not a
shortcut, it is the correctness requirement. `engine/china_intel_hub.py`'s
`_visit_block()` sends a no-rows name to `stale` only when the status matches that
literal string; every unrecognized status falls through to the `measured_no_event`
branch. A state named for key integrity would therefore have rendered a degraded
run as a clean, honest-looking "no visit filings for this company" — the precise
failure this repair exists to prevent, reintroduced by the repair itself. The hub
was read to establish this and deliberately left unedited.
