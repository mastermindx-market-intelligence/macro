mission: >
  Build and repair only P0A BTC Decision Authority Closure on the existing Macro
  branch and PR #6294. After Sol accepted exact source head 9ce6ce711602, merge
  current main normally, relinquish feature ownership of generated Vector bytes,
  preserve the accepted source blobs exactly, prove the reconciliation head, and
  release only through the repository's normal merge and canonical render lanes.
  Do not start P0B, alerts or broader redesign.
state_before: >
  Vector's final sizing already came from signals.alloc_optimal after
  btc_overrides.apply(), but S2 still rendered action, tone and a target band
  from the independent legacy btc_recommend result. The Aug 21 evidence shape
  could therefore show a 100% final model allocation beside a defensive 0-10%
  recommendation. The initial P0A implementation closed that display split but
  Sol returned two integrity defects: a 0.4 percentage-point raw/final mismatch
  could pass without an override, and a corrupt most-recent prior allocation
  could be skipped in favor of an older valid row. The held branch also needed
  a current-main reconciliation. The midterm calendar veto had already been
  retired by DEC:BTC-MIDTERM-BLACKOUT-AUTHORITY-RETIRED.
changed:
  - path: .github/ci/legacy-jobs.yml
    what: >
      Wired the new decision suite into the existing Vector organ step with its
      jsonschema dependency and widened the curated picks/boards import closure
      to include engine/btc_decision.py, closing both introduced contract-delta
      findings without creating a new job or weakening scope.
  - path: engine/btc_decision.py
    what: >
      Added the pure deterministic btc.decision/v1 builder. It derives action
      and exact target only from final alloc_optimal, exposes raw/final/override
      provenance, sanitizes advisory-only legacy fields, and fails closed on
      missing or inconsistent authority inputs. Sol-return repair
      667ea437021e removes the economically meaningful raw/final tolerance
      (retaining only 1e-12 representation jitter in allocation fractions) and
      refuses an invalid or out-of-range most-recent non-null prior allocation
      without searching farther back.
  - path: contracts/btc_decision.schema.json
    what: >
      Added the machine contract for valid ok and unavailable decision states,
      including conditional action requirements, bounded exposures and
      integrity receipts.
  - path: tests/test_btc_decision.py
    what: >
      Added deterministic cases for the Aug 21 split-brain shape, Kelly zero,
      bearish legacy context, mismatch/override integrity, missing inputs,
      exact 10 percentage-point thresholds, JSON safety, schema validity,
      bilingual numeric parity and the Vector consumer boundary. The Sol-return
      matrix adds 0.4 percentage-point mismatch with and without an active named
      override, floating-point representation jitter, and latest-prior values
      1.20, -0.10, infinity and non-numeric corruption with schema-valid
      unavailable receipts.
  - path: scripts/build_vector.py
    what: >
      Builds one DecisionState after the lawful override seam and passes only
      that object to the Vector template. The legacy recommendation remains
      available only as sanitized advisory levels/rationale and is no longer a
      template action or sizing object.
  - path: templates/vector.html.j2
    what: >
      Renders S2 action, exact target, direction and tone exclusively from
      DecisionState, with a fail-closed unavailable state and authority receipt.
      It removes the legacy target band and legacy action/tone consumers without
      changing the established Vector component language.
  - path: site/vector.html
    what: >
      Removed from the P0A feature delta during Sol's release reconciliation.
      Normal merge 78b07d80b9f7 resolves the generated page to exact current-main
      bytes at pickup 5ad13e2ed335. Canonical post-merge render.yml, not the
      feature branch, owns publication of the accepted template/source changes.
  - path: site/assets/css/e7978af3.css
    what: >
      Removed as an orphaned feature-render artifact after current main was
      verified to neither contain nor reference it. No main-owned asset was
      deleted.

    The prior-allocation reader skips nulls only. The most-recent non-null row

  - >
    Generated vector.html must pass inline CSS externalization and asset
    stamping. That publication contract is why the natural main render lane,
    including its site-only commit, is mandatory production evidence.

    DecisionState stores precise exposure as a 0..1 fraction and change as

## §0 State — what is true right now

Sol accepted exact P0A source head 9ce6ce711602 and authorized a bounded release
reconciliation. Normal merge 78b07d80b9f7 carries current-main pickup
5ad13e2ed335; the final pre-push normal merge additionally carries unrelated
current-main parent a8b7de1a47ae. Every protected P0A source blob remains exact.
The reconciliation resolves site/vector.html to main bytes and removes orphaned
e7978af3.css, so generated publication is no longer a feature delta. P0A is not
yet merged, canonically rendered or live-proven; PR #6294 remains Draft until the
new exact head passes the required local and hosted proof.

## §1 What is LEFT — in order

1. Complete and commit the requested local reconciliation proof; push only the
   existing branch and wait for exact-head hosted CI/fence/authority results.
2. Verify clean mergeability, record Sol's release, mark PR #6294 ready and merge
   by the normal path.
3. Observe the canonical main render.yml run and its site-only publication
   commit, then prove the live desktop/mobile EN/ZH decision surface. P0B, alerts
   and redesign still require separate authority.

## §2 What will bite you

The Vector builder writes ledgers and parquet before the HTML, so running it on
the feature branch would reintroduce the exact generated-artifact ownership Sol
removed. The canonical main render must publish and commit only site output.
Separately, a raw/final mismatch without an active named override is an integrity
failure, not a reason to choose whichever number makes the page look coherent.
The most-recent non-null prior allocation cannot be skipped when corrupt:
continuity fails closed instead.

## §3 What was decided and found

No new Decision or Discovery record was minted. The binding prior decision is
DEC:BTC-MIDTERM-BLACKOUT-AUTHORITY-RETIRED: election-calendar state is context,
not allocation authority.

## §4 Not in scope — do not adopt

P0B Crypto H5 authority closure, alerting, recommendation redesign, broader
Vector redesign and new override mechanisms were not started. P0A merge,
canonical publication and live proof are authorized only under this bounded
release. The legacy recommender remains intentionally present behind an advisory
allowlist; its removal or redesign would be a different program.
