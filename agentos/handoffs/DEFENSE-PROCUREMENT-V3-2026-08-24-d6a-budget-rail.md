mission: >
  Sol commission D6-A (authorization: macro PR #6355 comment 5395051048,
  Chairman sequencing amendment): activate the EXISTING DoD budget plane —
  official Comptroller FY2027 P-1/R-1 PDF → canonical R2 immutable store with
  readback proof → deterministic receipt-bound extraction → append-only source
  triad → government_budget_program_graph.v1 → existing Budget & Programs
  API/UI → production proof. No new budget system; no D5 contract widening;
  semantic firewall absolute (request ≠ authorization ≠ appropriation ≠
  execution ≠ obligation ≠ award ≠ revenue).

  2026-08-24T14:33:45Z. Budget plane deliberately PROJECTION_MISSING: hermetic
  fixture-only foundation (Wave 8), DOD_BUDGET_PRODUCTION_ACTIVATION_ENABLED =
  False at collectors/dod_budget.py:37, triad absent at HEAD, no live
  acquisition/extraction, publication hard-raising. Fresh collision census
  clean. D5 closed for sequencing at BUILT_NOT_PROVEN per the Chairman
  amendment.
changed:
  - path: research/defense_intelligence/DEFENSE_D6A_BUDGET_RAIL_DESIGN_2026-08-24.md
    what: >
      Frozen design: source census (war.gov host migration; FY2027 canaries
      with pinned sha256s), semantic mapping (5-member enum preserved; FY2027
      "Mandatory Request" → reconciliation_request; "FY 2026 Total" →
      prior_year_enacted_reference; two FY2026 sub-cells deliberately
      unextracted), acquisition order law, §5b/§5b.1 row model (survey-proven;
      E-7 shape revised to all-null after adversarial review).
  - path: collectors/dod_budget_live.py
    what: >
      NEW production module: allowlisted fetch (no redirects, size cap, %PDF
      magic), R2 put + strict bounded readback + byte/sha equality before any
      receipt, deterministic pdfplumber text+words extraction, production
      P-1/R-1 parsers per §5b/§5b.1 (boundary buckets, closed row taxonomy,
      per-side BA tracking, keyed page-pair joins, printed-addend grain,
      positional component capture, 0400D consolidated-only), idempotence
      gate, all-or-nothing atomic triad CLI.
  - path: collectors/dod_budget.py
    what: >
      Publisher constant → "Office of the Under Secretary of War
      (Comptroller)" (source-native FY2027 self-identification); all five
      amount semantics nullable (blank ⇒ None, printed 0 ⇒ 0.0); public
      normalization wrappers; line identity gains the budget-activity slug
      (both exhibits; R-1 genuinely reuses one PE across BAs — 29 real
      collisions); DOD_BUDGET_PRODUCTION_ACTIVATION_ENABLED = True.
  - path: data/government_revenue/ (triad)
    what: >
      REAL production triad committed by the dispatched runner acquisition
      (run 32764547804, commit 94ab73114336): 2 receipts, 2,172 line
      snapshots (P-1 1,009/81 totals; R-1 1,163/48 totals),
      projection_generation_id dod-budget-401e0479c00c449c3b4bd7e0.
  - path: .github/workflows/dod-budget-acquire.yml (PR 6378, merged separately)
    what: >
      Dispatch-only acquisition lane (no schedule; annual source), canary
      URLs in reviewed code, triad-files-only commit guard, shared
      government-revenue-live concurrency group; publishes nothing.
  - path: engine/government_revenue/budget_program.py
    what: limitations[0] rewritten to the truth of the activated rail.
  - path: app/government_revenue.py
    what: >
      _public_budget_line passes through the receipt-validated publisher
      instead of a hardcoded Defense-era literal.
  - path: templates/government-revenue-dossiers.js (+ site twin)
    what: >
      reconciliation_request card label → "Mandatory request / 强制性请求"
      (source-native FY2027 column); semantic key unchanged.
  - path: tests/ (test_dod_budget_live.py new; collector/build/api updates)
    what: >
      Hostile law battery per commission §7 + §5b.1 rulings, wired
      merge-binding into .github/ci/legacy-jobs.yml unrun-government-revenue
      (contract-delta gate satisfied); 114 passing in the budget selection.
  - path: agentos/ + research/defense_intelligence/D0R_SOURCE_RIGHTS_AND_PIT_REGISTRY.md
    what: >
      WS record amended per the Chairman sequencing amendment (D5 closed for
      sequencing, BUILT_NOT_PROVEN, D5P deferred/nonblocking; D6-A
      in_progress); DSC minted for the host migration; D0R registry re-census
      row added.

      authenticated-browser walkthrough performed or required (Chairman
      sequencing amendment).
unverified: []
unresolved:
  - >
    NO RETRACTION PATH for superseded parser generations (review MEDIUM 9,
    ruled a named unresolved): append_line_snapshot_versions is append-only
    and the graph serves the newest version per line_key, so a line a future
    parser generation stops emitting would persist. Binding constraint: any
    future parser_version bump must first design generation
    scoping/tombstones. Zero production risk today (first and only
    generation).
  - >
    FY2026 Discretionary-Enacted and PL 119-21 Spend Plan sub-cells are not
    representable in the frozen 5-semantic contract (deliberately
    unextracted). Enum widening is a separate Sol decision.
  - >
    E-7-shape (§5b.1(7)) publishes all-null amounts; the implicit-zero
    alternative was rejected as a computed sum. Both rationales go to Sol
    for ratification.
  - >
    Zero-numbered-line partitions (1612N BA01 NSBDF full-funding rows) are
    verification-only, not at line grain — named product gap.
  - >
    P-1 wrapped-nomenclature names that break BACKWARD onto a prior line
    render truncated (display-only; identity/amounts unaffected).
next_actions:
  - Post-merge: watch government-revenue-live publish the twins; production-prove API + page + anonymous boundary; report receipts to Sol.
  - Return to Sol with the full acceptance package (this handoff + PR #6377 + run 32764547804 receipts). D6-B+ and D7+ remain unauthorized.
do_not_redo:
  - Do not re-census the Comptroller surface from scratch; verify against the 2026-08-24 receipted census (war.gov; comptroller.defense.gov 403s permanently, no redirect).
  - Do not widen AMOUNT_SEMANTICS, touch D5 budget_program_keys (const []), or create a second budget publisher/store plane.
  - Do not bump the live parser/extractor version without first designing the retraction/generation-scoping mechanism (unresolved #1).
  - Do not use PyMuPDF in the production path (AGPL ruling; pdfplumber is frozen).
  - Do not re-run the acquisition expecting changes — same bytes are an idempotent NOOP by design; new official bytes append a NEW observation.
danger_areas:
  - The SCN/shipbuilding row model (§5b.1) is the load-bearing subtlety — parenthesized gross values are memo, the printed net-memo row on the FOLLOWING page carries the additive value; never "fix" a parenthesized value into a negative amount.
  - government-revenue-live shares one concurrency group with dod-budget-acquire; never cancel its runs (hook-enforced).
  - The p.158 pinned anomaly table is exact-tuple-scoped to document sha b8d52482…; a NEW FY document with text glitches must mint its own pinned entries, never widen matching.
