mission: >
  Sol R6 continuation (2026-08-21), two bounded tracks, records-only in this
  repo: Track A — reconcile and close the DEP-CAI identity gate against
  current China Alpha state (PR-0B done, RIGHTS-0 done, PR-0D/D2B2-CN-HK the
  residual), waiting only on the already-existing first natural production
  run of the owner-routed D2B2-CN-HK path and verifying its persistence /
  GMI-resolution / US-invariance proof; Track B — establish the current
  DEP-EXACT authority/rights state from the frozen R6 commission and return
  the smallest exact operator action, with no gate edits, no fabricated
  receipts, no bulk backfill, no model work. Repair the stale DEP-CAI wording
  as part of this first legitimate records update. No DEP-ID-ELIG, I1A-T1,
  or any feature wave.
state_before: >
  P0-ST closed 2026-08-20 (#6047 + #6099, production proof run 32348780228 /
  commit baf4cf7c9291). WS DEP-CAI row was stale: still named "execute PR-0B
  and prove it live" as the remaining gate although PR-0B had flipped done /
  PROVEN_LIVE (asia-close run 32348780228) and RIGHTS-0 had merged done
  (#6046). D2B2-CN-HK (#6116, squash ed28d0d992a1) was BUILT_NOT_PROVEN,
  waiting on the first natural nightly containing it — run 32426513915 was
  executing during this session. DEP-EXACT next_action was the original R6
  gate wording with no current-state census. The exact-plane authority
  decision had no DEC record.

unresolved:
  - "DEP-EXACT is now WAITING_FOR_WRITTEN_VENDOR_GRANT (second slice, 2026-08-21): the authority decision IS taken — DEC:CNLI-EXACT-PLANE-REQUIRES-WRITTEN-COMMERCIAL-GRANT (ceo-sol) binds the written-grant receipt path and rejects ruling-3 for the exact plane. The single blocking artifact is the vendor's written reply to research/cn_limit/TUSHARE_VENDOR_LETTER_PACKET_2026-08-21.md §1; the DEC alone does not satisfy the runtime gate (both fail-closed constants unchanged). Post-grant 9-step procedure is pre-staged in packet §3, not activated."
  - "DEP-ID-ELIG remains closed: DEP-CAI is now done but DEP-EXACT still gates it. The PIT membership/suspension/ST-history substrate is NOT_BUILT; only the identity half (984 CN + 147 HK canonical) exists."
next_actions:
  - "Operator: send the Chinese letter in research/cn_limit/TUSHARE_VENDOR_LETTER_PACKET_2026-08-21.md §1 from the account-holder identity — that is the whole remaining action for DEP-EXACT."
  - "When a written vendor reply exists: archive the grant bytes privately (never this public repo), then run packet §3 steps 2-4 (receipt, independent allowlist, reviewed trust-root pin) under normal review; canary and later steps stay gated behind those artifacts."
  - "No further CN-Limit build work is authorized from this session: I1A-T1 and DEP-ID-ELIG open only per the R6 wave graph once DEP-EXACT closes."
do_not_redo:
  - "Do not re-verify or re-adjudicate the D2B2-CN-HK natural proof — run 32426513915 is measured, owner-adjudicated (#6165), and corroborated here; a second flip PR would only churn the records."
  - "Do not open a PR-0B audit: pr0b was flipped done on the same asia-close receipt (run 32348780228) before this session started."
  - "Do not edit spine gate constants, mint authorization receipts, or run any tushare-spine-backfill execute dispatch — the untaken authority decision is an operator act, and a red execute run is the gate working."
  - "All standing program bans hold: no W1-W3 citation, no adjusted-plane restoration (DNR:KILL-CN-ADJUSTED-TAPE-LEGAL-LIMIT), no P-B2/P-B3 rerun, no outcome audition."
danger_areas:
  - "daily.yml's cron pair: the 23:30 DST sibling concludes SUCCESS having built nothing (only et_gate runs), while the real 22:30 run can conclude CANCELLED from a single irrelevant job (standout_audit_us here) after every identity-path job succeeded. Neither run-level conclusion is usable as a proof verdict — always read job-level conclusions and the produced commits."
  - "The identity_resolution sidecar is append-per-computation: raw state counts are multiples of the node population (984 CN resolved rows per batch, several batches). Always restrict to one computed_at batch (or distinct node_ids) before quoting rates."
  - "master_generated_at in the sidecar comes from data/reference/_receipt.json (re-stamped by the run's collect commit), not from the master parquet bytes — a byte-stable master with a fresh receipt stamp is the designed no-op refresh, not a contradiction."

Sol R6 continuation, 2026-08-21: DEP-CAI reconciled and closed on the natural
production proof of the owner-routed identity child; DEP-EXACT re-censused —
machinery complete and fail-closed, blocker is exactly one untaken operator
authority decision (plus, on the receipt path, one vendor letter). The
workstream record now carries the full dependency truth: DEP-CAI done,
DEP-EXACT blocked-on-operator, DEP-ID-ELIG closed until both are done.
Cold-stranger read order: WS-CN-LIMIT-ALPHA.md DEP-CAI + DEP-EXACT rows, then
records PR #6165 (owner adjudication), then this handoff's verified block for
the measurement commands.
