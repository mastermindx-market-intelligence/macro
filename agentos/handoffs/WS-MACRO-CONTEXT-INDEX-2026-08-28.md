  Sol commission macro-context-index-completion-20260828-sol-001, wave C0
  Benchmark Truth Recovery: make the 104-row gold / evaluator / current 3-repo
  baseline truthful before any retrieval-ranking change. Persist Sol's frozen
  C0->C8 completion architecture as the durable repository record. No retrieval
  algorithm changes permitted or made.
state_before: >
  Latest committed attestation was v5 (2026-07-20): 76 shared rows, 43 pass,
  global 56.6%, negative controls 0/10, private block never evaluated, and the
  governance gate labelled "precision" was actually family pass-rate (admitted
  in the evaluator docstring). CTX-067/069 were suspected stale negatives (CXI
  itself now exists). Private-row eval queried all three DBs instead of the
  owning project's DB; a missing private DB could grade a no_answer row as a
  false "correct null". The local terminal/mastermind checkouts were
  stale/dirty (charting-app: side branch 702 behind, ~6k dirty files;
  Mastermind: 155 behind) so no truthful private baseline had ever been run.
changed:
  - path: research/MACRO_CONTEXT_INDEX_COMPLETION_MASTERPLAN_BY_SOL.md
    what: >
      NEW. Durable repository copy of Sol's frozen C0->C8 completion
      architecture (Chairman approval 2026-08-28, operation key, Skillpack pin
      e2092cb62355, architecture freeze, failure-state law) with an exact
      precedence clause: the freeze governs program/waves; CXI-R1..R23a rulings
      stay binding; CXI-R19 advisory status unchanged until C8.
  - path: scripts/context_index_eval.py
    what: >
      C0 metric repair (evaluator only): governance gate binds to TRUE
      micro-averaged A0/A1 precision (DEC:CXI-GOV-PRECISION-GATE-IS-TRUE-PRECISION);
      old pass-rate metric renamed to informational "Governance recall (row
      pass-rate)"; new explicit gate "Negative-control (no-answer) accuracy
      >=90%"; NOT-EVALUATED handling for missing owning-project DBs (never
      passes, no_answer rows included); per-row owning-project DB scoping per
      CXI-R16; repo SHA + dirty flag in run headers; append-only writer
      unchanged.
  - path: tests/test_context_index_eval.py
    what: >
      Extended to 22 tests: true-precision TP/FP arithmetic incl. zero-denominator
      NOT-MET, negative-control accuracy, missing-DB NOT-EVALUATED never passes,
      owning-project DB scoping.
  - path: research/context_index/BENCHMARK_QUESTIONS.jsonl
    what: >
      v1.6 amendment pass, 6 rows amended with receipts: CTX-012
      forbidden->superseded (CXI-R12 kill OVERRULED by Chairman 2026-08-12);
      CTX-067/069 stale negatives regolded to positive rows (CXI-W1 shipped the
      things they declared nonexistent); CTX-095 stale negative regolded
      (Terminal portfolio_positions ledger shipped 2026-08-13 #408); CTX-091
      required source regolded to ingest/pull_macro_intel.py (gold doc was never
      merged to terminal master); CTX-087 notes line citation 306->622.
  - path: research/context_index/README.md
    what: >
      v1.6 amendment log entry (full receipts, no-change adjudications for
      CTX-010/082 per CXI-R17c, memory-overlay row disposition, families-table
      correction — v1.5 never absorbed CTX-094's regold), repaired gate
      definitions in the Promotion gates section.

    what: >
      Appended truthful baselines. Run v6 (shared-only, 76 rows): global 55.3%,

      Run v7 (full scope, first-ever private evaluation, 104 rows, 0
      not-evaluated): global 44.2% (46/104), adjudication replay 37.5% (6/16),

unresolved:
  - >
    Negative-control family is now 9 rows (12 true pre-amendment, minus 3 stale
    corrections); whether to author replacement negatives is Sol's call (flagged
    in the v1.6 receipt and the C0 RESULT).
  - >
    Terminal CTX-095's strict reading ("fills") vs loose reading ("positions")
    was adjudicated loose-with-honest-notes; Sol may re-rule.
next_actions:
  - Sol adversarial review of the C0 recovery head on PR #6600 (DRAFT / HOLD-FOR-SOL).
  - After terminal C0 acceptance, C1 deterministic relevance + abstention on the frozen v1.6 gold requires a fresh child operation, carrier reconciliation, commission, pickup, and watcher cycle. This C0 handoff is not C1 pickup authority.
do_not_redo:
  - >
    Do not re-audit the 104 rows against the same heads (macro 24ccea3fe482 /
    terminal b1b21a17f843 / mastermind e2092cb62355) — the two JSONL audit
    artifacts and the v1.6 receipts already record the outcome.
  - >
    Do not "fix" CTX-010/CTX-082's superseded-label-vs-§1-section layering —
    adjudicated no-change per CXI-R17c (see v1.6 amendment entry).
  - >
    Do not build a truthful private baseline from the occupied local checkouts —
    they are stale/dirty; use MACRO_CTX_TERMINAL_ROOT / MACRO_CTX_MASTERMIND_ROOT
    pointed at clean worktrees minted from fresh origin heads.
  - >
    Do not treat v1-v5 "Governance A0/A1 precision" numbers as precision — they
    are row pass-rate (DEC:CXI-GOV-PRECISION-GATE-IS-TRUE-PRECISION).
danger_areas:
  - >
    BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md is append-only; the run-number counter counts
    "## Eval run " headings — never edit prior sections.
  - >
    The eval writes ONLY to BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md (or --output); the build writes
    ONLY to .context-index/. Keep it that way in sparse worktrees.
  - >
    Retrieval ranking is FROZEN until Sol issues C1 — nothing in
    engine/context_index/** may change under the C0 carrier.

## Notes for the next session

The prior C0 carrier was Slack #agent-dispatch thread 1787897185.145289
(operation macro-context-index-completion-20260828-sol-001) and is terminal
`SESSION_LOST / SOL CLOSED-STOP`; it grants neither pickup nor continuation
authority. Its separate C0 recovery is bound only to PR #6600 under
`macro-context-index-c0-recovery-20260828-sol-002`, DRAFT / HOLD-FOR-SOL.
The truthful baseline is intentionally red — C0's deliverable is honest
measurement, not green gates. After terminal C0 acceptance, C1 must receive a
fresh child operation, fresh carrier reconciliation, fresh commission/pickup,
and a fresh watcher cycle before it runs before/after comparisons on the FROZEN
v1.6 gold with per-row reasons and mutation tests; threshold-only retuning is
forbidden by the masterplan.
