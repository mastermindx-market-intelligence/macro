title: Prophet Conditional Fusion — PR-3D production commissioning + liveness fence + lawful status
date: 2026-08-18
session: claude/prophet-fusion-pr3d-liveness
model: local

main_at_start: 4b77e9afd24c15127b7206d4aed855d2a1b36234
mission: >
  PR-3D only. Close W3 instrumentation as a real production capability: durable
  session_missing semantics, W3-native provenance fence against #5878 generic
  backfill, live three-lane acceptance, and a lawful pre-floor status surface.
  No V4, no C2/C3/C4/C5, no comparative outcome read.
state_before: >
  PR-3A #5813, PR-3B #5829, PR-3C #5839 merged. W3_RACE_PREREG frozen. data/us_prophet_rank/w3
  absent on origin/main. First post-#5839 daily (run 32084697588) still in engine;
  us_scan_tier and us_prophet_ledgers had not started. Committed board as_of=2026-08-17
  is us_prophet_v3 with prophet_fusion.w3_structural.v1. Candidates store has 65
  v3+shadow buy rows on that stamp. Grades store has never been committed to main.

next_actions:

danger_areas:
  - "Observation identity is candidate stamp_date / board as_of, never GitHub run date or UTC wall clock."
  - "session_missing and degraded_or_unpaired are terminal. Only unmatured → paired_accrued is lawful."
  - "W3 step must fail visible on a first missing required stamp, but the always-run commit must still land sessions.jsonl + status.json."
  - "A pytest tmp path containing the substring 'pages' is not a Pages artifact; the source-token fence must not scan filesystem paths."
  - "Reading comparative W3 outcomes before the honest-N floor contaminates the frozen prereg."

# PR-3D — production commissioning (BUILT_NOT_PROVEN)

PR-3D is instrumentation closure, not a statistical read. C1 stays the live
ranker. No forward C1-vs-shadow outcome was inspected.

## Step 0 — natural night (re-inspected 2026-08-18)

Post-#5839 daily **32084697588** (`workflow_dispatch`, head `63f4055e`, contains
PR-3C) was still `in_progress` with **engine running**. `us_scan_tier` had not
started. `us_prophet_ledgers` needs `[et_gate, engine, us_scan_tier]`, so W3
accrual has not run. `data/us_prophet_rank/w3` is absent on `origin/main`.
The 6-second "success" scheduled run 32081800404 skipped every job except
`et_gate`. Do not treat that as a bake.

Committed board `as_of=2026-08-17` is `us_prophet_v3` and already carries
`ranking.fusion.w3_structural` schema `prophet_fusion.w3_structural.v1`.
The candidates store has **65** canonical-buy rows with both C1 and
`us_prophet_v2_shadow` on that stamp. The grades store has **never** been
committed to main, so first liveness is **unmatured**.

A dry-run of the PR-3D writer against that committed tree (no writes) reported
`2026-08-17 unmatured paired=65 pending=65` and older stamps
`degraded_or_unpaired`. That is not production proof.

## What landed in this PR

Durable `sessions.jsonl` keep-first history. Required stamp comes from committed
board as_of (`--require-board-as-of`). A first missing required stamp persists
`session_missing` then fails visible so the `if: always()` commit can still
stage the gap. Terminal states refuse later reconstructed candidate payloads
(`DEC:W3-PROSPECTIVE-SAMPLE-IGNORES-GENERIC-BACKFILL`). Status/CLI may show
accrual/maturity/gap plus outcome-blind structural counts only.
