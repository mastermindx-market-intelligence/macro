ended_because: blocked
mission: >
  Reconstruct every genuine post-2026-08-17 close-pass acceptance session before
  changing code, determine whether the three-session close→candidate→reader ruler
  has passed, reconcile current coverage/W-L2/collisions, and leave the exact
  durable continuation boundary.
state_before: >
  The workstream was still pinned to an Aug-15/17 next_action and said W-ACCEPT
  was todo, despite later Breathing host failures and the independently discovered
  27-day US Prophet Live publication freeze.
changed:
  - path: agentos/workstreams/WS-BREATHING-PLATFORM.md
    what: >
      Reconciled W-ACCEPT to in_progress with the actual Aug17-Aug26 forensic
      ledger, zero proven consecutive green sessions, current evidence gap,
      W-L2 re-cut ruling, and collision fence. No runtime/product code changed.
verified:
  - claim: Protected Sol procedure is current and compatible for this operation.

  - claim: 2026-08-17 is a hard W-ACCEPT failure.
    command: >
      agentos/handoffs/BREATHING-PLATFORM-2026-08-18.md + PR #5862/#5866:
      host runner refused stale/unknown code after the lane-preparation probe
      stalled; receipt outcome lane_unprepared; no board.
  - claim: 2026-08-18 through 2026-08-25 cannot form a W-ACCEPT reader streak.
    command: >
      research/PROPHET_US_LIVE_FORCE_MAJEURE_2026_08_26_EVIDENCE.md and the
      #6464/#6470 incident chain: live_flow/prophet_live.json had no successful
      publication after 2026-07-30 through 2026-08-25; the served evaluator copy
      had never existed. close_pass_mirror deliberately never creates that file,
      so first_user_visible_at through the required carrier cannot pass.
  - claim: Prophet Live itself was restored and production-proven on 2026-08-26.
    command: >
      PR #6483 records natural 13:28:05Z/13:33:05Z publishing passes and a
      15:23Z healthy dead-man with status=live, pack_ok=True, current pass/quote
      ages and producer ownership. This proof occurred before the 20:00Z close
      and therefore is not the Breathing evening ruler receipt.
  - claim: The last durable close-pass same-session breadth proof is 1,684/1,763
      (95.5%), not a current Aug26/27 production census.
    command: >
      research/BREATHING_PLATFORM_CONTINUATION_HANDOFF_2026-08-15.md after #5746.
      No later durable real-session numerator/denominator was found in current
      GitHub/Agent OS/Slack evidence. Prophet Live n_names=180 is not that metric.
  - claim: The original W-L2 instruction is partially superseded.
    command: >
      Current scripts/build_prophet_live_pack.py already uses ProcessPoolExecutor
      and explicitly treats its wall-clock/verification budget as safety law;
      #6464/#6470/#6482/#6483 now own/prove publication liveness alerts; current
      WS:LIVE-ENTRY-RADAR owns tactical live-entry alerting.
  - claim: No Breathing-specific repair commission is causally justified yet.
    command: >
      The only current confirmed unresolved code defect found that can affect the
      armed pack is D12 source-tip/as_of correctness, already recorded under
      WS:PROPHET-US-AVAILABILITY. No post-restoration Breathing ruler failure has
      yet been observed.
unverified:
  - "Whether a 2026-08-26 close_observed_at→first_candidate_at→first_user_visible_at receipt exists on a private host but was never durably recorded."
  - "Current real-session same-session universe coverage after #5746; last durable exact measurement is the 2026-08-14 replay at 95.5%."
  - "Three consecutive post-restoration real sessions; proven green streak is 0 at this reconciliation."
  - "Browser-visible combined degraded behavior when close-pass board_state is fresh but the independent Prophet-Live top-level data is stale; board identity/freshness guards are proven, but the combined real browser state is not accepted here."
unresolved:
  - "W-ACCEPT remains the completion blocker: recover Aug26 if it exists, then accrue three consecutive genuine green reader-measured sessions."
  - "D12 armed-pack source-tip correctness stays with WS:PROPHET-US-AVAILABILITY; Breathing must not duplicate the owner."
  - "W-L2 residual must be measured/re-cut after D12: process fan-out and liveness alerts are already superseded; only a demonstrated breadth capability gap remains commissionable."
next_actions:
  - "Recover/grade the Aug26 SLO row from immutable host + reader receipts. Missing remains NOT ACCEPTED."
  - "For each next genuine NYSE session, capture close_observed_at, first_candidate_at, first_user_visible_at, evaluated/universe coverage, skip reasons, and browser proof at desktop+narrow."
  - "Stop and commission a bounded repair only if a failed real row identifies a Breathing-owned causal defect."
  - "After three consecutive greens and the W-L2 residual ruling, close Agent OS accurately; do not call current state complete before then."
do_not_redo:
  - "No third live/prophet_live writer."
  - "No new Massive WebSocket."
  - "No VPS-side canonical board engine."
  - "No weakening _bsQualify reader identity/freshness guards."
  - "No arbitrary timeout/resource inflation in place of causal repair."
  - "No Prophet rank/gate/entry-timing retune from this workstream."
  - "No duplicate Live Entry Radar alert system."
  - "No reconstruction of reader timestamps from downstream artifacts."
commission_state: >
  No new Fable implementation carrier was dispatched. Current Slack operating law
  freezes DELIVERY_ONLY pickup posts without a known active receiver and makes
  delivery distinct from ACK/execution. No ACK was fabricated. D12 is routed by
  owner boundary to the existing PROPHET-US-AVAILABILITY workstream.
danger_areas:
  - >
    W-ACCEPT is in acceptance, not speculative repair: a new code wave without a
    failed observed row naming a Breathing-owned cause violates the continuation
    boundary this record freezes.
  - >
    D12 armed-pack source-tip correctness is owned by WS:PROPHET-US-AVAILABILITY;
    duplicating it from Breathing recreates the dual-writer hazard the do_not_redo
    list forbids.

# Breathing Platform forensic acceptance verdict — 2026-08-27

## Session ledger

| Session | Verdict | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-17 | FAIL | `lane_unprepared`; no candidate board; Prophet Live also stale-pack/dark. |
| 2026-08-18 | FAIL | Prophet Live stale-pack; required served carrier absent. |
| 2026-08-19 | FAIL | Prophet Live stale-pack; required served carrier absent. |
| 2026-08-20 | FAIL | Valid live evaluation, publication lost; served carrier absent. |
| 2026-08-21 | FAIL | Valid live evaluation, publication lost; served carrier absent. |
| 2026-08-24 | FAIL | Prophet Live stale-pack; publication/served carrier absent. |
| 2026-08-25 | FAIL | Valid live evaluation, publication lost; served carrier absent. |
| 2026-08-26 | UNVERIFIED / NOT ACCEPTED | Prophet Live repaired during RTH, but no durable evening close→candidate→reader row found. |

**Verdict: W-ACCEPT FAIL / OPEN. Proven consecutive green sessions = 0.**

## W-L2

The old W-L2 wording is not executable as-is. Parallelization is already present;
publication/dead-man alerting is now the Availability plane; tactical alerts are
Live Entry Radar. The only Breathing residual is an evidence-driven breadth outcome:
after D12 is correct, does valid armed-level coverage materially limit the same-session
experience? Measure first. Do not buy literal full-universe probing with inflated
timeouts/memory or weakened verification.

## Exact continuation boundary

This program is in **acceptance, not speculative repair**. The next operator must
recover the Aug26 ruler if it exists and then grade natural sessions. The first new
code wave must name a failed observed row and a Breathing-owned cause. Until then,
no implementation commission is justified.
