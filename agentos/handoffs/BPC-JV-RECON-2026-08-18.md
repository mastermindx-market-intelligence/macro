mission: >
  Soak-safe freeze closure on PR #5909. Revert live source-registry mutation
  and new JV registry tests. Keep accepted architecture. Add sequencing law
  that runtime registration waits for the post-soak successor registry /
  successor launch-manifest transition. Do not start SNAPSHOT-ONBOARD,
  CONTINUOUS-RECON, or runtime work. Do not reopen architecture.
state_before: >
  Sol-accepted architecture was still inserting biopharmcatalyst_jv_snapshot
  into the live soak-bound config/biocatalyst_sources.yml. Semantic CI found a
  direct pr_regression because the launch SLO manifest hash-binds those
  predecessor bytes.
changed:
  - path: config/biocatalyst_sources.yml
    what: Reverted this PR's modifications; file matches the soak-bound predecessor on origin/main.
  - path: tests/test_biocatalyst_source_registry.py
    what: Reverted the four new JV runtime-registry tests; pre-existing tests preserved.
  - path: agentos/decisions/DEC-BPC-JV-SNAPSHOT-RUNTIME-REGISTRY-POST-SOAK.md
    what: New Sol sequencing DEC — canonical identity frozen now; runtime insertion deferred.
  - path: agentos/decisions/DEC-BPC-JV-SNAPSHOT-IS-NOT-BENCHMARK.md
    what: Answer records deferred runtime insertion; evidence no longer cites a live YAML JV row.
  - path: agentos/decisions/DEC-BPC-JV-FINITE-SNAPSHOT-RIGHTS-CHAIRMAN.md
    what: Evidence no longer cites live YAML/tests; decided_by remains chairman.
  - path: research/BPC_RECON_0_JV_SNAPSHOT_ARCHAEOLOGY_AND_SOURCE_SYSTEM_RECONSTRUCTION_FREEZE_2026-08-18.md
    what: Soak-safe freeze; sequencing law; §14 no longer claims the live registry already holds the JV identity.
  - path: agentos/workstreams/WS-BPC-JV-RECON.md
    what: Sequencing landmine; new DEC listed; status/waves unchanged.
  - path: agentos/handoffs/BPC-JV-RECON-2026-08-18.md
    what: Handoff rewritten for soak-safe closure.

## §0 State — what is true right now

Sol accepted the RECON-0 architecture. Semantic CI then found a soak-bound
registry hash miss. This head makes #5909 a soak-safe architecture freeze:
canonical identity `biopharmcatalyst_jv_snapshot` is frozen in freeze/DECs/WS;
the live source registry is the unchanged predecessor; runtime registration
waits for the post-soak successor transition. RECON-0 remains done. SNAPSHOT-ONBOARD
and CONTINUOUS-RECON remain todo. Matcher-only RECON-1 stays dropped.

## §1 What is LEFT — in order

1. Merge PR #5909 after CI/fences and semantic ci-gate show no #5909-attributable pr_regression. Keep `merge-on-green` off.
2. After merge, return to Sol for commissioning of the first bounded SNAPSHOT-ONBOARD vertical.
3. Do not start SNAPSHOT-ONBOARD, CONTINUOUS-RECON, Drugs@FDA work, device/CDRH, PDUFA work, or any runtime implementation from this PR.

## §2 What will bite you

The Historical FDA CSV cannot be matched raw: 28.1% of rows are left-shifted.
W1–W3 were absent from the operator filesystem searched 2026-08-19 but still
exist in the Chairman's File Library. The soak-bound predecessor registry must
not be mutated. Export-time IV/OI/expected-move columns are capture-time
overlays, not pre-event features.

## §3 What was decided and found

- `DEC:BPC-JV-FINITE-SNAPSHOT-RIGHTS-CHAIRMAN` — Chairman authority; `decided_by: chairman`.
- `DEC:BPC-JV-SNAPSHOT-IS-NOT-BENCHMARK` — distinct canonical identity; runtime row deferred.
- `DEC:BPC-JV-SNAPSHOT-RUNTIME-REGISTRY-POST-SOAK` — soak-safe sequencing; `decided_by: ceo-sol`.
- `DEC:BPC-CATALYST-COMPOSES-WITH-COMPANY-EVENT-NOT-FISCAL-WORKSPACE` — `jv_reconciliation_match_key`.
- `DEC:BPC-RECON-1-DRUGSATFDA-APPROVED-SPINE` — calibration component, not program completion.

## §4 Not in scope — do not adopt

No runtime collector, no soak change, no live YAML JV row, no machine-enforced
JV source-registry tests in this PR, no launch-manifest re-hash, no Prophet
flag, no snapshot ingest, no SNAPSHOT-ONBOARD or CONTINUOUS-RECON start, no
`merge-on-green`.
