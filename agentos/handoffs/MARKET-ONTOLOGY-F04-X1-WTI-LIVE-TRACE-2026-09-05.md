model: opus
ended_because: complete
mission: >
  F04-X1 Stage A. A researcher opens /ontology.html and receives one truthful
  current WTI Live Trace — the owner-observed path, which conditions hold, the
  first blocking leg, what changed, why it is dormant, evidence and clocks per
  leg, and one next research action — without manufacturing causality,
  confidence or a scenario forecast.
state_before: >
  main carried the nine-record F04 constitution but no /ontology.html and no
  /api/ontology/explorer/v1. SPEC_ONLY / X1_NOT_BUILT.
changed:
  - path: "engine/ontology_explorer.py"
    what: >
      New. Pure request-time composer of ontology_explorer_snapshot.v1 over
      knowledge/transmission/<chain>.yaml and data/transmission/chain_state.json
      (plus chain_episodes.jsonl when present). Never calls
      transmission_chains.run() — it defaults write=True and appends the episode
      ledger, so a GET would mutate an owner artifact. Deliberately does not call
      validate_chain() either: that is the nightly's gate and it RAISES, while a
      request-time surface must degrade with a legible typed state and must not
      change product semantics when the nightly's strictness moves.
  - path: "app/ontology_explorer.py"
    what: >
      New. GET /api/ontology/explorer/v1 behind require_user ->
      enforce_site_full(always=True). Private headers applied via a route class,
      because the outcomes most likely to leak (401/403 from a dependency, 422
      from validation) never reach the handler. Typed 503, no fallback.
  - path: "templates/ontology.html.j2, templates/ontology.{css,js}, site/*"
    what: >
      New. Public shell with zero current values plus the paired plain-copy
      assets. Signature is a severed rail in pure CSS — no canvas, no SVG, no
      graph library — which is what lets it turn vertical on a phone and satisfy
      "mobile path without graph-canvas JS" by construction.
  - path: "scripts/build_ontology_explorer.py"
    what: >
      New, feature-owned. Avoids contending for scripts/build_site.py, which an
      open sibling carrier owns.

do_not_redo:
  - >
    Do not render owner falsifier notes verbatim on a user surface. The live WTI
    chain's second note carries the word "falsified", the raw node id
    yield_rise, and no Chinese — three front-facing violations in one string.
    engine._screen_note withholds it and shows the structured condition instead.
  - >
    Do not use --ok / --act / --warn as TEXT colours. On the light canvas they
    measure 4.32:1 and 3.60:1. theme.css already ships --ink-* for text; the
    house form is var(--ink-act, var(--act)).
  - >
    Do not treat an unparseable build stamp as age zero. `built` is
    "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC", not ISO; the silent fallback rendered as "built just
    now".
  - >
    Do not re-litigate K1. Sol ruled at 1788593425.474829; the decisive fact is
    that txi.chain_state is an excluded_derived_head in
    contracts/evidence_foundation/vocabulary.v1.json and a dormant chain has no
    eligible txi.episode_transition. The broader claim that K1 requires
    fabrication or has no possible producers was WRONG and is withdrawn.
  - >
    The carrier's nav collision claim is false. Neither #6828 nor #6834 touches
    templates/_navlinks.html.j2. The real four-way contention is
    .github/ci/legacy-jobs.yml.
  - >
    Do not measure a response bound against the WALK. `_walk_path` follows one
    successor chain, so a discontinuous or branching hop list truncates silently
    and every downstream number then describes a partial path as a whole one —
    including `state: active` for a path with unread FALSE legs.
  - >
    Do not assert a contradiction from a leg that was never read. The note says
    a later leg reads true "while an earlier one does not"; an unread leg makes
    that sentence false.
  - >
    Do not clamp a negative age to zero. A `built` stamp in the future is not
    "built just now" — that is the same defect the stamp parser exists to close.
  - >
    Do not rely on a FastAPI route class to stamp headers on a 405 or a HEAD.
    Starlette's router decides both BEFORE the route class is entered, and an
    unhandled exception escapes to ServerErrorMiddleware, which is outside both
    the route class and app/main.py's no-store middleware.
  - >
    Do not anchor a slug guard with `^...$`. Python matches `$` before a trailing
    newline, so a slug with a line break appended passes. Use `fullmatch`.
  - >
    A broad review commission that cannot finish returns NOTHING. The first
    reviewer here hit its turn limit mid-orientation. Cut reviews into narrow
    passes with an explicit tool-call budget and an instruction to report what
    they have when they reach it.
danger_areas:
  - >
    transmission_chains.run() defaults write=True and appends
    data/transmission/chain_episodes.jsonl. Any request-time consumer must read
    the artifacts directly. A test monkeypatches run() to fail loudly.
  - >
    The mid-read digest re-verification cannot catch a source rewritten just
    BEFORE its own read (that read returns the newer generation and digests stay
    stable). The revision coherence check is what closes that window; neither
    check is redundant.

      the one leg of the journey this session did not exercise. Status codes,

      _site_nav/_navlinks family plus a toolbar below the global nav. An earlier
      revision of this handoff wrongly listed the family as unresolved; the only
      thing outstanding is applying the hunk, which waits on sibling ownership
      of _navlinks.html.j2, not on a decision.

    Return the Stage B integration-hunk packet to F00: register
    scripts/build_ontology_explorer.py in the site build, add the page-registry
    row, add the four test files to CI selection, and add the _navlinks entry
    (family already fixed by Amendment 3 section 2) once sibling ownership of
    that template clears.

## Narrative

The part worth carrying forward is not the feature; it is that four defects
survived a careful reading of my own code and were caught only by running it.

A build stamp that would not parse became an age of ZERO — which renders as
"built just now", the most reassuring possible reading of a value the code had
failed to understand. A falsifier note copied straight out of an owner file put
banned refutation vocabulary, a raw node id, and untranslated English onto a
bilingual page in one string. Two status colours that are correct as fills
failed as text on the light canvas at 4.32:1 and 3.60:1. And the terminal
station of the rail claimed a confirmed outbound link that does not exist,
invisibly, because CSS hides that connector.

Each one produced a page that looked right. What caught them was measuring:
parsing the real stamp, scanning the real knowledge file, computing contrast
against the actually-painted ancestor, and reading the DOM rather than the
screenshot. Every one is now pinned by a test, and the vocabulary screen runs
against the live chain rather than a fixture — because a fixture I wrote would
have been clean.
