mission: >
  Execute Sol child operation marketontology-f00b-current-owner-crosswalk-20260828-sol-001
  (parent marketontology-complete-parity-fanout-20260826-sol-001, Linear MAS-170):
  produce one current, executable parity crosswalk over the frozen 88-row
  authenticated baseline + 42-row current-public delta scope, recording per row the
  exact current canonical owner, proven-tier capability state, evidence, missing
  journey, source/rights dependency, authority ceiling, active sibling carrier, and
  recommended disposition, so F00 can route work without rebuilding organs sibling
  programs already own.
state_before: >
  The 88+42 ledgers existed as frozen adoption accounting (all rows
  PENDING_OPERATOR_RECONCILIATION / PENDING_F00_RECONCILIATION) with owner ROUTES
  but no current proven-tier capability states, no per-row evidence, and no
  collision map against the sibling programs that had advanced since 2026-08-26
  (Options C0, OA1T, Stock Identity freeze, GMI fold, Eval OS freeze, K2-C
  merged-not-accepted, LER frozen). No F00B artifact existed in the repo.

    what: >
      New 130-row overlay crosswalk (88 baseline + 42 delta), zero UNKNOWN/UNOWNED
      rows, every owner cell WS:/lane-bound, house capability-state and disposition
      vocabularies, explicit UNVERIFIED flags inline (27 rows) instead of silent
      claims. Historical ledgers untouched.

      Companion synthesis: state/disposition counts, per-lane matrix, biggest
      existing capabilities, biggest true gaps, Sol-amendment reconciliation
      (persistent-analysis lifecycle + RMS depth), sibling-collision table,

verified:
  - claim: "Every row's current_owner is a lawful responsibility owner; implementation absence lives only in state/evidence (Sol REQUEST_REPAIR item 2)."
    command: "python3 regex sweep of current_owner for none/unassigned/unresolved/unowned/not-built/neither/not-established patterns after rewriting 23 rows to workstream/lane responsibility owners"
    result: "PASS — zero offending owner cells, and (second-audit standard) all 130 owner cells carry an explicit WS:/lane responsibility binding; missing implementations remain NOT_BUILT/SPEC_ONLY in capability_state with evidence."

      rewritten to the Prophet conditional-fusion truth (three F5 signs;
      gex_confirm_verdict dropped-on-presence 0.46) and disposition
      PROVEN_EXISTING→UPGRADE_EXISTING; owner standard tightened to explicit
      WS:/lane binding on all 130 rows (75 prefixed + 6 rewritten); UNVERIFIED
      register corrected 25→27; competitor-authority refusal made explicit on
      MO-PAID-024/042 and MO-DELTA-005 ceilings.
unverified:
  - claim: "MAS-170 Linear projection text matches the carrier's stated F00B intent."
    what_would_verify: "Authenticated Linear MCP read of MAS-170 (unavailable this session — connector unauthenticated)."
  - claim: "Display-tier surfaces cited from templates/ are fresh on the live site today."
    what_would_verify: "Live-URL/nightly-artifact receipts; sparse worktree omits site/ and data/ by design, so freshness rests on workflow/engine receipts and known render law."
  - claim: "No licensed deal-flow/rating/maritime/sovereign data contract exists anywhere outside the repo."
    what_would_verify: "Chairman/commercial contract inventory; census can only prove no reference exists in code/docs."
unresolved:
  - "Completion label is COARSE_CROSSWALK_COMPLETE only (per #6611 merge 532fe442 / DEC:MARKET-ONTOLOGY-GRANULAR-FULL-PARITY-BEYOND-PARITY-RATCHET): this artifact is the coarse F00C owner-map input; COVERAGE_COMPLETE/PARITY_COMPLETE are separate later milestones; no disposition here is an exclusion."
  - "P-001..P-006 are consumed at their ACCEPTED preservation-evidence tier (#6610 merged as 471597e00baf from a7ff402a): mapped onto existing rows/families/owners, no new parity rows; SAFE_TO_LOSE_MARKETONTOLOGY_ACCESS: NO, P1 OPEN_IMPORT_GATE, P-003/P-005 persistence unproven, and P-006 route/schema-evidence-only are preserved."
  - "MAS-170 Linear projection unread (connector unauthenticated); carrier text treated as the governing intent."
  - "REJECTED_BY_DESIGN candidates await explicit Sol rulings (MO-PAID-048/050 absent license, MO-DELTA-040, authority semantics of MO-PAID-024/MO-DELTA-006)."
  - "27 rows carry inline UNVERIFIED flags (options producer wiring, display freshness receipts, off-repo data contracts, Supabase-side deletion, non-US legal sources, commodity-family coverage)."
  - "HISTORICAL, resolved: the breathing-platform validate errors that existed at first commit were healed by #6605 (merged); agentos validate on the final reconciled head is 0 errors."
next_actions:
  - "Sol adjudicates the proposed next fanout set (summary §Proposed next fanout): F11 Thesis-object vertical, F12 tenancy foundation, F07 consensus-source ruling, F09/F02 consolidated rights docket, F01/F13 cheap projections, existing-carrier accelerations."
  - "F00 folds this overlay into its coverage accounting; delta ledger stays living — recheck public surfaces at next milestone."
  - "REJECTED_BY_DESIGN candidates need explicit Sol rulings: MO-PAID-048/050 (absent license), MO-DELTA-040, authority semantics of MO-PAID-024/MO-DELTA-006."
do_not_redo:
  - "Do not re-run this census from scratch; refresh only rows whose sibling carriers move (#6604, #6585 impl [#6576 plan already merged records-only], #6529, #6522, #6514, #6596, #6543; Eval OS #6582 freeze + #6598/#6607 already merged — records/evidence tier only, no capability promotion)."
  - "Do not mint a second analysis lifecycle or RMS engine — amendment reconciliation scoped both inside MO-PAID-046/047/053 as projections over falsifier_tripwires + macro_thesis patterns."
  - "Do not inherit competitor Opportunity authority semantics (direction/confidence/priced%) absent calibrated K5/Eval-OS promotion."
  - "Do not import/reconstruct the retained 1,556-row P1 corpus — F00A exact-byte import remains a separate open gate."
danger_areas:
  - "Merged ≠ accepted: K2-C (#6533) and every HOLD carrier must be read at its Sol-acceptance state, not its merge state, when consuming this crosswalk."
  - "Sparse-tree blindness: site/ and data/ absence is a worktree profile, never capability evidence; 27 rows carry explicit UNVERIFIED freshness/wiring flags."
  - "Rights-gated rows (military/maritime/satellite/chokepoint/deal-flow/sovereign) must not be commissioned as builds before their Chairman/commercial gates."

# F00B current-owner crosswalk — 2026-08-28

Cold-stranger summary: the 88 authenticated baseline + 42 current-public delta
rows now carry a current, evidence-backed overlay (owner, proven-tier state,
rights, ceiling, sibling, disposition) in
`research/market_intelligence_productization/MARKET_ONTOLOGY_F00B_CURRENT_CAPABILITY_CROSSWALK_2026-08-28.csv`,
with synthesis and the proposed next fanout in the companion summary. Headline:
options context, Mastermind chat, billing/auth, portfolio holdings truth, macro
dashboards, the event spine, capital-structure engines, and Eval OS measurement
law are the eight substrates parity work must project over; F07
valuation/scenario (5/5 NOT_BUILT, no consensus source), F12 tenancy/API (12/18
NOT_BUILT), F09 workbenches (rights-gated), and the single F11 Thesis-object
build are the true gaps. This session is the F00B child only — it claims no
F01-F13 lane and arms nothing on sibling carriers.
