mission: >
  Execute operation temporal-grain-gakd-artifact-attack-r1-20260903-sol-001 on its sole
  branch and Slack carrier: implement the strict local ChartRecipe/export/bar/kernel/parity
  contracts, preregister and run the outcome-blind G/A/K/D mechanical attack, add a
  reproducible CLI and external capture runbook, prove the right-safe synthetic path, and
  return one immutable DRAFT / HOLD-FOR-SOL PR without live capture, W1B, merge, deployment,
  production effect, or signal authority.
state_before: >
  PR #6803 was Draft at 5fc7153f45d9c76e5daed836dbb1ceb1b9bd73f6 when Sol returned
  SOURCE_REPAIR_REQUIRED on Slack carrier C0BSBM78V1N/1788429215.974389. The first repaired head
  a99869f50e6d3449d7690166af8315e93e5714b0 implemented the eight-clause amendment, after which
  independent immutable review found two remaining mixed-case fail-open paths: the nonstandard
  chart's A-axis diagnostic was emitted outside the preregistered grid, and one changed K1/K2 path
  could collapse to K0 while the other changed path masked it. Both findings were repaired with
  discriminating regressions before the final exact-head review cycle. Exact WMT and motivating
  silver TradingView packets remained absent and could not lawfully be replaced with synthetic
  rows or another feed. The sticky native task remained 01a066b4-65d5-7592-9495-b627acd7ff8f.
changed:
  - path: research/signal_engine/temporal_scale/tradingview_temporal_recipe_probe.pine
    what: >

    what: >
      Added the external capture identity/rights/history runbook, explicit session-definition and

      deterministic half-life math and evidence-bound unequal-time clock vectors.

      histogram-turn timestamp equality.
  - path: scripts/research/temporal_scale/artifact_attack.py
    what: >
      Added complete pre-diagnostic TrialLedger registration and outcome-blind G/A/K/D, parity

      phase paths, executed K0/K1/K2 paths, separate observed/probe receipt channels, registration
      for every emitted chart-construction axis, and per-execution K1/K2 collapse detection.

  - path: tests/test_temporal_scale_artifact_attack.py
    what: >
      Added grid registration/classification, no-effect boundary, actual-clock, provisional,
      malformed evidence and synthetic CLI end-to-end tests, including standard/nonstandard
      diagnostic-registration coverage and separate K1-only and K2-only no-op mutations.
  - path: agentos/workstreams/WS-TEMPORAL-GRAIN-INTELLIGENCE.md
    what: >

      a99869f50e6d3449d7690166af8315e93e5714b0 found two mixed-case gaps. New RED tests proved
      both gaps, then GREEN proved A-axis chart-construction preregistration and independent

      A separately authorized external capture child first identifies the exact silver product,

      Obtain independent exact WMT and silver typed results, immutable exact-head review and a
      fresh same-carrier Sol CONTINUE. Synthetic green alone remains BUILT_NOT_PROVEN.
unresolved:
  - WMT status is UNRESOLVED_DATA; no exact recipe, export, lower-grain packet or result hash was delivered.
  - Silver status is UNRESOLVED_DATA; the exact product/vendor/contract-or-roll/session packet was not delivered.
  - PR #6803 final record-bearing exact-head hosted CI and immutable Sol review are pending.
  - W1B, usefulness outcomes, live capture, Ready, merge and deployment remain explicitly held.
next_actions:
  - >
    Sol reviews PR #6803 clause by clause at its final immutable head, verifies hosted checks and
    either posts a same-carrier correction or an explicit CONTINUE/STOP. Keep the PR Draft and
    do not merge while the hold remains.
  - >
    If separately commissioned, the external Mac capture child delivers exact WMT and silver
    packets independently. Do not substitute a proxy feed or pool the two identities.
  - >
    Start no W1B work unless exact W1A packet receipts mechanically survive and Sol issues a new
    same-carrier CONTINUE after reviewing them.
do_not_redo:
  - Do not create another branch, worktree, task, PR, watcher, carrier, evaluator, TrialLedger, identity plane, data plane or chart renderer.
  - Do not infer exact WMT or silver parity from synthetic fixtures or another vendor/feed.
  - Do not use W1A geometry to claim FILTER_MEMORY, SESSION_GRAMMAR, MIXED or usefulness.
  - Do not read returns, trough quality, adverse excursion, trade economics, rankings, portfolio metrics or other W1B outcomes.
  - Do not mark PR #6803 Ready, arm merge-on-green, merge, deploy, or modify production/Prophet authority under this operation.
  - Do not stop the temporal-grain-w1a-carrier-watch watcher unless the same Slack carrier emits an explicit Sol STOP.
danger_areas:
  - A nominal timeframe is not actual elapsed or traded time; clipped bars, DST, maintenance breaks and missing minutes must remain explicit.
  - The final provisional row must remain quarantined and can never complete confirmed coverage.
  - Standard price-MACD is a labelled implementation control and never replaces owner RSI-MACD parity.
  - D is explicit but nonblocking; a comparable numeric PARITY failure is ARTIFACT even while lower G/A/K is unavailable, while missing/uncomparable evidence remains UNRESOLVED_DATA.
  - Trial enumeration must remain registered before diagnostics and must never write data/trial_ledger.jsonl.
  - Raw licensed TradingView/vendor rows remain outside Git; receipts and summaries may not leak them.
  - Main moves rapidly; any later release requires a fresh same-path collision and protected-source read.

## Capability delta

Before W1A, the repository held only the frozen W0 architecture and plan. It now has an executable,
strict and locally reproducible chart-packet/parity/GAKD harness plus synthetic proof, repaired to
require explicit session and lower-data provenance and to execute rather than merely describe K and
phase interventions. The capability ceiling remains `BUILT_NOT_PROVEN / RESEARCH_ONLY /
PRODUCTION_INERT`: both exact motivating packets are independently `UNRESOLVED_DATA`,
`final_mechanism_classification` remains null, every authority boolean remains false, and no
usefulness, W1B, live capture, Ready, merge or deployment effect exists.
