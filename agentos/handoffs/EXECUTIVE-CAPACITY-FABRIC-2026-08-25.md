model: codex
ended_because: complete
mission: >
  Reconcile the existing MAS-126 CF1 implementation carrier with protected current Macro main,
  replace stale local proof without changing the frozen provider-capacity behavior, and return the
  same draft PR #6297 to Sol with a fresh exact-head hosted-proof gate and HOLD-FOR-SOL intact.
state_before: >
  Draft PR #6297 was parked at head 2df53626bae9b1a5efdf6f822a54997c0fdc3cd3 with complete
  2026-08-23 receipts, but protected Macro main had advanced and those receipts no longer proved
  current-base compatibility. The original branch and linked worktree remained the single carrier.
  This reconciliation is bound to operation key MAS-126-CF1-RECONCILE-20260825.
changed:
  - path: .github/ci/legacy-jobs.yml
    what: >
      Retained the single CF1 provider-owner registration while incorporating current-main CI changes
      through non-force merge history; no provider-capacity behavior was changed by reconciliation.
  - path: agentos/handoffs/EXECUTIVE-CAPACITY-FABRIC-2026-08-25.md
    what: >
      Replaced the stale return packet with this exact pre-record implementation receipt, an explicit
      pending-hosted-proof boundary, and negative proof for every later Capacity Fabric wave.
  - path: agentos/workstreams/WS-EXECUTIVE-CAPACITY-FABRIC.md
    what: >
      Kept CF1 at BUILT_PENDING_SOL and recovery pointed to this exact-head review packet; every later
      wave remains todo and held.
verified:
  - claim: The operation reused the original PR, branch and linked worktree without a replacement carrier.
    command: git status --short --branch; git rev-parse HEAD; git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
    result: >
      PR #6297 remains bound to branch sol/executive-capacity-cf1-20260823 and worktree
      /Users/chriswong/Documents/Cluade/macro-main/.warp/worktrees/mas-126-cf1. The exact pre-record
      reconciled implementation head is dc391292302b42452e68d48d9a21864ebcc76eda.
  - claim: The current local implementation head includes the protected-main pickup without history rewrite.
    command: git show -s --format='%H %P' dc391292302b42452e68d48d9a21864ebcc76eda
    result: >
      Head dc391292302b42452e68d48d9a21864ebcc76eda has first parent
      9774e739142732ee98c6a146db66e5ff8e84f5c3 and protected-main pickup
      4caccc2a98a1e19d58fe484be814830deb0da46d. Protected origin/main later advanced to
      878930b3b2f9849e120391fa461ed528f32d2e3c, so Task 4 must merge and re-prove that movement
      before any push or current-base claim.
  - claim: The pre-record changed-file and import census remains bounded to CF1 and its records.
    command: git diff --name-status 4caccc2a98a1e19d58fe484be814830deb0da46d..dc391292302b42452e68d48d9a21864ebcc76eda; rg -n 'provider_capacity' scripts/build_provider_capacity.py tests/test_provider_capacity.py
    result: >
      Relative to the merged base, the pre-record candidate has 12 paths: one CI registration,
      four plan/Agent OS records, four existing provider-owner modules, one new normalizer, one
      stdout consumer and one contract test. The only static provider_capacity import sites are
      scripts/build_provider_capacity.py and tests/test_provider_capacity.py. The normalizer reads
      four existing owner modules through bounded lazy imports; there is no Mastermind/Executive
      importer, second runtime, database, queue, router or service.
  - claim: CF1 and all directly touched neighboring provider-owner suites pass on the reconciled head.
    command: python3 -m pytest -q tests/test_provider_capacity.py tests/test_codex_provider.py tests/test_provider_health.py tests/test_key_pool.py tests/test_key_pool_economy.py tests/test_key_pool_seven.py tests/test_metabolism_budget_gate.py
    result: 224 passed, 0 failed and 3 pytest temporary-directory cleanup warnings.
  - claim: The unchanged exact CI-registered provider-owner line passes under the hosted-CI Python version.
    command: python -m pytest tests/test_codex_provider.py tests/test_llm_auth.py tests/test_key_pool.py tests/test_ollama_provider.py tests/test_ai_costs.py tests/test_provider_health.py tests/test_provider_capacity.py -q
    result: >
      233 passed, 0 failed and 3 pytest temporary-directory cleanup warnings in a disposable
      Python 3.12.13 virtual environment, matching the hosted CI interpreter version. The ambient
      Mac python is legacy Python 2.7 and is not evidence for or against the manifest command.
  - claim: Agent OS records remained schema-valid before this record refresh.
    command: python3 scripts/agentos.py validate
    result: 717 records, 0 errors and 28 unrelated current-main warnings.
  - claim: The real CLI is strict canonical JSON and makes no canonical-source or Git worktree write.
    command: python3 -m pytest -q tests/test_provider_capacity.py::test_real_cli_is_canonical_json_and_no_write
    result: 1 passed, 0 failed and 3 pytest temporary-directory cleanup warnings; Git status and HEAD were unchanged.
  - claim: Semantic source identity, Git grounding, caller-injection boundaries and secret redlines remain closed.
    command: python3 -m pytest -q tests/test_provider_capacity.py -k 'material or allowlist or audit or hash or secret or injection'
    result: 17 passed, 21 deselected, 0 failed and 3 pytest temporary-directory cleanup warnings.
  - claim: Two real projections preserve semantic identity across distinct projection times.
    command: python3 scripts/build_provider_capacity.py twice, parsed only through strict public contract fields
    result: >
      Both projections used schema mastermind.provider_capacity.v1 and preserved snapshot hash
      b35dd08046c13866ac865871512f90b016ef0396f5f71d4d9ca5fa47a4cfecc9 plus material-source

      dc391292302b42452e68d48d9a21864ebcc76eda matched HEAD and material_sources_match_commit was
      true. Inventory remained 12 slots: Claude 8, Codex 3 and DeepSeek 1. Honest degradation
      census was PROVIDER_BUDGET_UNKNOWN=12, PROVIDER_HEALTH_UNKNOWN=4 and
      PROVIDER_OUTCOME_UNKNOWN=4. No credential value, provider-home content, path or account PII
      was read or emitted for this receipt.
unverified:
  - claim: The final record-bearing PR head has concluded all hosted binding checks green.
    what_would_verify: >
      Re-pin and reconcile the newer protected main, repeat the complete local proof, push only the
      existing branch, then wait for every binding exact-head check on PR #6297 and publish its URLs.
      Hosted proof state is PENDING_EXACT_HEAD; PR #6297 is the canonical evidence location.
  - claim: Sol accepts or releases CF1 for merge.
    what_would_verify: >
      Load REVIEW_RETURN.md from protected Mastermind Skillpack commit
      80331fdc2ab9085f39ec1f3c01ff38a73d0e239f, review the final exact-head diff and hosted packet,
      and issue an explicit release decision. This handoff grants no release authority by itself.
unresolved:
  - "Hosted proof remains PENDING_EXACT_HEAD because origin/main moved after the local receipt."
  - "The three repeated pytest warnings concern temporary-directory cleanup outside the repository; no test failed."
next_actions:
  - "Resolve the record-bearing candidate head from Git after this commit; a Git record cannot contain its own commit SHA, so do not guess or backfill that SHA into this file."
  - "Re-pin protected main immediately before push; merge the known movement to 878930b3b2f9849e120391fa461ed528f32d2e3c or newer without rewriting history and repeat the complete Task 2 local proof."
  - "Push only sol/executive-capacity-cf1-20260823 and bind PR #6297 to the resolved head plus concluded exact-head hosted receipts."
  - "Perform Sol REVIEW_RETURN against that same exact head and make an explicit release decision; until then capability state is BUILT_PENDING_SOL and terminal state is PARKED / HOLD-FOR-SOL."
do_not_redo:
  - "Do not create another branch, PR, provider-capacity store, service, daemon, router, inventory numbering scheme, Executive schema, queue or placement lane."
  - "Do not add or run Personal Pro login/readiness, inspect or rotate worker credentials, inspect provider-home contents, or change the normal Mac Codex app in CF1."
  - "Do not begin CF2-F, CF2-I, RF1, HF1, PF1, MH1, Cursor/Grok or any other provider expansion until the reviewed dependencies are satisfied."
  - "Do not mark ready, arm, merge, deploy or call PR #6297 accepted or live; HOLD-FOR-SOL remains binding."
danger_areas:
  - "The record commit changes the candidate Git head while provider material bytes remain unchanged; the record-bearing head must be resolved after commit and proven through PR #6297."
  - "High-churn protected main moved after this local proof. No current-base or hosted-green claim is lawful until it is reconciled and the complete proof is repeated."
  - "Credential presence remains source-owner-private. Never inspect or serialize auth contents, paths, cookies, tokens, Keychain values or account PII."
  - "Unknown quota, health or outcome is an honest contract result, not free capacity or provider readiness."

This packet proves bounded local compatibility only at pre-record implementation head
`dc391292302b42452e68d48d9a21864ebcc76eda`. It does not claim hosted proof, Sol acceptance,
merge, deployment, production use, Executive placement, Personal Pro readiness, worker-realm
provisioning or provider expansion. Capability state is `BUILT_PENDING_SOL`; terminal state is
`PARKED / HOLD-FOR-SOL`. PR #6297 must bind the later record-bearing candidate SHA and its hosted
receipts because a Git record cannot embed the hash of its own commit.
