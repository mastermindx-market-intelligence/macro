mission: >
  Release and normally squash-merge Sol-approved P1-1R PR #6277, observe its
  automatic public-render and natural VPS updater without dispatching or
  restarting anything, then rerun the complete real authenticated production
  API/safety/2055/1280/390 EN/ZH/lineage matrix. On PASS, record P1-1 as
  PROVEN_LIVE_COHORT_LIMITED and done in a new records-only PR held for Sol.
state_before: >
  P1-1 was merged and deployed but its durable production verdict was FAIL:
  real desktop Radar cards shrank below their content and collided. Sol had
  approved exact repair head 0e48c8830b8a26050ccfae453f2b385118b1ea59,
  but #6277 was still held and P1-1 remained in_progress.

    what: >
      Added the new production-success receipt with the exact repair merge,
      automatic render run/commit, natural VPS/static-byte proof, current
      generation, authenticated and signed-out API matrix, safety walk, all six
      deployed-byte geometry cuts, real EN/ZH lineage, console status, bounded
      acceptance claim, and explicit non-claims.

    what: >
      Set wave P1-1 to done and recorded PROVEN_LIVE_COHORT_LIMITED while
      keeping broader parity PARTIAL. No next CORE-PRODUCT wave is commissioned;
      P1-2 and any source/cohort transition remain separately gated.

unverified:
  - claim: BioCatalyst has full functional parity beyond the current four-NCT cohort.
    what_would_verify: >
      The separately governed post-soak breadth/parity program. P1-1 is only
      PROVEN_LIVE_COHORT_LIMITED and broader parity remains PARTIAL.
  - claim: P1-2 is authorized or started.
    what_would_verify: >
      A new explicit Sol/operator commission after the separately gated source
      and soak evidence is frozen and adjudicated. Neither P1-1 success nor the
      end of the soak window grants that authority.
unresolved:
  - >
    Whether and when any successor BioCatalyst source/cohort transition is
    commissioned remains unresolved pending frozen soak evidence, separate
    adjudication, and an explicit Sol ruling. No P1-1 issue remains.
next_actions:
  - >
    No CORE-PRODUCT action is commissioned. Do not start P1-2, widen the cohort,
    change source cadence/soak law, or infer production-scale authority without
    a separate explicit Sol ruling.
  - >
    The source-governance owner must freeze and adjudicate the exact soak
    evidence before any successor source/cohort transition. The
    2026-08-26T02:00Z window end grants no expansion authority by itself.
do_not_redo:
  - >
    Do not reopen #6191 substantive review, #6271's valid historical FAIL, or
    #6277's accepted Radar-only repair. The deployed falsifier is now green.
  - >
    Do not repeat static deployment by manually dispatching public-render,
    invoking macro-update, restarting macro-api, editing the page query/stamp,
    or injecting candidate CSS. The natural chain and exact bytes are receipted.
  - >
    Do not upgrade PROVEN_LIVE_COHORT_LIMITED to full parity or production-scale
    proof. The current cohort contains four configured/observed NCTs and parity
    remains PARTIAL.
  - >
    Do not expose browser credentials, private worker receipts, object keys,
    source pointers, filesystem paths, R2 keys, or hashes through the product.
danger_areas:
  - >
    templates/biocatalyst.css and site/biocatalyst.css remain paired plain-copy
    assets. The public page uses an immutable content stamp generated by the
    automatic render-public workflow; do not hand-edit the page stamp.
  - >
    Desktop queue scrolling is intentional. The accepted repair prevents only
    .bci-radar-card shrink; a global trial-row sizing change or queue
    rearchitecture would widen the product beyond the proved mechanism.
  - >
    Current-generation movement may advance public retrieved_at clocks without
    changing the underlying source dataset or row truth. Recheck the pointer
    and compare payload deltas before treating a clock-only move as semantic.

## Current state

P1-1 is production accepted and closed at PROVEN_LIVE_COHORT_LIMITED. Broader
parity remains PARTIAL. There is no commissioned P1-2. The next BioCatalyst
source-expansion decision remains separately gated by the frozen soak
evidence/adjudication and a new Sol commission.
