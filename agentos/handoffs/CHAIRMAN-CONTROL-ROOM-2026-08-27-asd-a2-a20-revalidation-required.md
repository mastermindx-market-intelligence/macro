workstream: WS:CHAIRMAN-CONTROL-ROOM
session: sol/asd-a2-a20-pass-reconcile-20260827
model: sol
ended_because: blocked
mission: >
  Reconcile the returned ASD-A2 host census against the Chairman's current Slack handoff admission law
  without laundering useful read-only evidence into an accepted A2-0 PASS, and preserve the exact
  revalidation needed before any production Agent Relay implementation carrier is released.
state_before: >
  Claude3 returned a detailed read-only `A2_0_PASS` for operation
  asd-a2-host-preflight-20260827-sol-001, but explicitly disclosed that the census had already run
  before the Slack ACK was posted. While reconciling that return, Macro main advanced with Chairman
  decision DEC-SLACK-HANDOFF-INITIAL-ENVELOPE-REQUIRES-PREWORK-ACK, making admission ordering a
  current binding requirement for manual CEO-to-Claude Slack handoffs.
changed:
  - path: Slack #agent-dispatch parent 1787815350.178199
    what: >
      Preserve the prior Claude3 census only as advisory read-only evidence. It reported zero mutation
      and found Agent Relay app/principal, credential reference, launchd label, AF_UNIX socket,
      install/config roots and divergent A2 code carriers absent/free, but it is not accepted A2-0
      execution proof because work preceded the required Slack ACK.
  - path: agentos/decisions/DEC-SLACK-HANDOFF-INITIAL-ENVELOPE-REQUIRES-PREWORK-ACK.md
    what: >
      Current Chairman law requires the initial handoff envelope itself to say BEFORE DOING ANY WORK:
      ACK the exact operation in-thread, read the full existing thread, and do not execute until both
      steps are complete. Thread replies cannot retroactively supply a prerequisite needed for safe
      admission. ACK remains protocol evidence, not Executive lifecycle truth.
  - path: Slack #agent-dispatch parent 1787834271.424569
    what: >
      Sol issued a new read-only revalidation operation
      asd-a2-host-preflight-revalidate-20260827-sol-002 with the complete mandatory pre-work ACK and
      full-thread-read sequence embedded in the initial envelope. The receiver must return only
      A2_0_REVALIDATED_PASS or A2_HOST_COLLISION and then stop.
  - path: mastermindx-market-intelligence/Mastermind protected master
    what: >
      Action-time protected Mastermind / Skillpack is
      c590ff21664761e6bd4a6558175b6666c5c7eba2. The only movement after accepted H0/security head
      8affa1c0403f4400825371bea0257f360a4814f2 is Project Recovery R8 records/source-law material;
      it does not touch integrations/slack_agent_dialogue/**. No current asd-a2 or agent-relay
      implementation branch/PR exists.
  - path: mastermindx-market-intelligence/macro main
    what: >
      Action-time Macro main is bb554dcfc67b5080c7308f8ca256c6c6ffef886d. This carrier was
      reconciled onto that exact main rather than merging stale Agent OS bytes over the newer hybrid
      workforce source-law reconciliation.
  - path: Slack workspace current census
    what: >
      #agent-dispatch C0BSBM78V1N currently has ten user principals and no bot/app member; workspace
      user search finds no relay principal. The dedicated Agent Relay app/token remains a real native
      prerequisite even if A2-0 revalidation passes.
verified:
  - claim: The prior A2-0 census content was read-only and found no A2 resource collision.
    command: "Read Slack thread 1787815350.178199 including Claude3 ACK/result packet."
    result: >
      The packet records only read operations and no host/repo/Slack/credential mutation. Its resource
      census is useful advisory evidence, but its timing disclosure makes it inadmissible as accepted
      preflight proof under current Chairman admission law.
  - claim: Current Chairman handoff law requires pre-work ACK from the initial envelope.
    command: >
      Read current Macro main bb554dcfc67b5080c7308f8ca256c6c6ffef886d decision
      DEC-SLACK-HANDOFF-INITIAL-ENVELOPE-REQUIRES-PREWORK-ACK.
    result: >
      The initial envelope must require ACK + full-thread read before execution; a later ACK does not
      repair work that already began.
  - claim: A clean revalidation carrier has been issued without mutating A2 resources.
    command: "Slack send receipt for #agent-dispatch parent 1787834271.424569 and current thread reread."
    result: >
      Operation asd-a2-host-preflight-revalidate-20260827-sol-002 is DELIVERY_ONLY / READ_ONLY,
      contains the complete pre-work admission sequence in the initial message, and at action time
      still has no thread replies. No duplicate revalidation carrier was issued.
  - claim: Current protected Mastermind is still code-path disjoint from accepted A1.
    command: >
      Compare Mastermind 8affa1c0403f4400825371bea0257f360a4814f2 through
      c590ff21664761e6bd4a6558175b6666c5c7eba2 plus current A2 branch/open-PR census.
    result: >
      The exact protected delta is only two Project Recovery R8 plan/spec files; there is no
      integrations/slack_agent_dialogue/** movement and no competing A2 implementation carrier.
unverified:
  - claim: A2-0 is accepted under current admission law.
    what_would_verify: >
      The active Claude3 session first ACKs operation asd-a2-host-preflight-revalidate-20260827-sol-002
      in thread 1787834271.424569, then reads the complete thread, reruns the bounded read-only census,
      and returns A2_0_REVALIDATED_PASS with action-time pins and no collision.
  - claim: Dedicated Agent Relay Slack app/token is provisioned and least-privilege scopes are correct.
    what_would_verify: >
      Native workspace-admin creation/install plus a secret-owning verifier returning only allowlisted
      app/bot/workspace/channel/scope metadata; credential bytes never enter model-visible output,
      argv, environment, Git, Agent OS, Linear, logs or receipts.
  - claim: ASD-A2 production transport is live.
    what_would_verify: >
      Only after accepted A2-0 revalidation: one bounded Mastermind implementation carrier, real
      app/service install and harmless request -> Sol ruling -> same-session readback canary plus the
      duplicate/effect-unknown/restart/refusal proof matrix and zero lifecycle mutation.
unresolved:
  - "A2-0 is REVALIDATE_REQUIRED; the prior pre-ACK PASS must not release implementation."
  - "Native Slack workspace app install and private credential enrollment remain required after revalidation."
  - "No Agent Relay bot is currently a #agent-dispatch member."
  - "ASD-A3 and ASD-A4 remain NOT_BUILT / UNSTARTED."
next_actions:
  - "Wait only for the same explicit revalidation carrier 1787834271.424569; do not create another A2-0 operation or fail over to another receiver."
  - "If and only if A2_0_REVALIDATED_PASS returns under the pre-work ACK law, Sol may release exactly one bounded Mastermind A2 implementation carrier from current protected master."
  - "Keep production app/token/service mutation gated on native Slack workspace admin and private credential confirmation."
  - "After real A2 canary/proof, return to Sol and STOP before ASD-A3/A4."
do_not_redo:
  - "Do not accept the earlier pre-ACK A2_0_PASS as current production-preflight proof."
  - "Do not create a second revalidation Slack carrier while operation asd-a2-host-preflight-revalidate-20260827-sol-002 is unresolved."
  - "Do not rebuild ASD A0/A1 or create a dialogue DB, cursor, queue, inbox, retry ledger or second lifecycle."
  - "Do not absorb C1/Executive Relay, CeoIngress, Wake, CF2/provider routing, P0B/Multilogin or Chairman browser identity."
  - "Do not expose credentials through model-visible settings, argv/env/shell variables, temp files, logs or receipts."
danger_areas:
  - "Slack ACK is admission-protocol evidence only; it does not prove Executive claim, RUNNING or RESULT."
  - "Agent Relay and Executive Relay remain distinct principals, credentials, channel laws, install roots and authorities."
  - "A2 is active-session dialogue only; it cannot find, assign, wake, resume or originate Executive Jobs."

# Return point

The previous A2-0 census is useful testimony but not accepted proof under current Chairman admission law.
The sole next carrier is Slack thread `1787834271.424569`. No A2 implementation branch is authorized until
that exact revalidation returns `A2_0_REVALIDATED_PASS` after a pre-work ACK and full-thread read.
