mission: >
  The CI semantic base-replay could not check out ANY base SHA, so every
  main-inherited red on the fleet was reported `classification=unknown` and
  ship_loop_guard.py charged it to the PR under the INTERNAL block ladder
  (10 consecutive / 15 total) instead of the external one (2 / 3). Find the
  real cause, fix classification (never make `unknown` permissive), and make
  the next occurrence diagnosable from the report alone.
state_before: >
  Reported from PR #5853's guard output: two packs (3 and 6), two separate
  `ci-base-replay-*` temp clones, two different base SHAs — one of them
  minutes old after a fresh rebase — all failing identically with
  `Command '[... 'checkout', '--detach', '--force', <base>]' returned non-zero
  exit status 1`. No stderr anywhere in the record, so every downstream
  consumer saw a command line and an exit code. Main was independently red
  (ci-pack-5, ci-pack-6, ci-gate on run 32110254994), which the broken
  classifier could not attribute.
changed:
  - path: scripts/run_ci_pack.py
    what: >
      `_hydrate_exact_base_objects` + `_missing_tree_objects` +
      `_promisor_remote`, called from `_ensure_exact_commit` — a commit whose
      blobs cannot be read is not acquired. `_git_run_bounded` gains `env` and
      `stdin_text`. The checkout drops `capture_output=False`, and
      `_describe_failure` makes `_bounded_detail` carry a failed child's own
      stderr instead of only its exit status.

      Three fixtures: the partial-clone replay regression (with its own
      vacuity guard), the no-promisor no-op, and the stderr-in-detail pin.

    what_would_verify: >
      after merge, a PR whose pack reds are inherited should report a
      `classification` other than `unknown` with a `tested_tree_sha` at the
      base. This session could not observe it: the fix must be ON main for a
      pack to run it, and main was independently red throughout.
unresolved:
  - >
    THIS PR IS COMPLETE AND BLOCKED ON MAIN, not on itself. Its own full-suite
    run was 11/12 packs green (scripts/run_ci_pack.py is a GLOBAL_INVALIDATOR,
    so nothing was scope-skipped); the single red, ci-pack-5, carried an
    annotation byte-identical to main's own ci.yml run. It touches scripts/**,
    so it is authority-changing and cannot lean on a base-inherited red.
  - >
    Chasing main green, this session took PR #5874 (the single main-red-repair
    PR) manual with a marker comment, per the disarming rule, and drove three of
    main's four reds to green on it: contract-drift (ci-pack-5, the original
    conflict), leader-radar-unit (ci-pack-10) and signal-contract (ci-pack-6).
    The fourth, ci-pack-8 / unrun-picks-boards, was deliberately NOT fixed —
    see next_actions. #5874 remains armed and is the merge gate for the fleet.
  - >
    MAIN'S FAILING PACK SET ROTATES BETWEEN BASELINES, which is why per-pack
    healing does not converge: 08:12Z fc9d5819 {pack-5}; 09:02Z 8227d096
    {pack-3, pack-4, pack-5, pack-9}; 10:44Z e343b8be {pack-1, pack-4, pack-5,
    pack-9}; concurrent PR heads {pack-6, pack-8, pack-10}. Only pack-5 was
    common to all. Every case diagnosed was a test asserting on live
    nightly-advanced state, and THREE OF FOUR were test defects, not data
    defects — the nightly output was correct each time. A ~35-minute heal cycle
    cannot outrun a set that rotates every couple of hours.
next_actions:
  - >
    ci-pack-8 / legacy-job-unrun-picks-boards needs the Prophet Conditional
    Fusion owner, not a repair session. All 9 failures in
    tests/test_prophet_fusion_c2.py share one cause: the graded ledger accrued
    past the 7/7/4 date-block era the tests pin, so refusals became estimates
    ('estimated' != 'NOT_ESTIMABLE'; 2 != 0; refused_below_min_dates now empty;
    1627 != 1474) and the live recomputation drifted off PR-1b's frozen
    artifact. Fix = re-run PR-1b and re-freeze the doc tables (CHANGES PUBLISHED
    RESEARCH NUMBERS — needs sign-off), or PIT-pin the C2 test frame to PR-1b's
    era. Relaxing the assertions is NOT a third option: it deletes the parity
    property that file exists to hold.
  - >
    When main is green, rebase this branch onto it and re-run; nothing in the
    change itself is outstanding.
  - >
    After merge, read one real PR's base_replay record: `outcome` should not be
    "unavailable", and a genuine failure should now carry git's stderr in
    `detail` rather than an exit status alone.
  - >
    If a replay ever reports "exact-base hydration left N object(s)
    unresolved", that is the loud form of this bug and names the residual OIDs
    plus the fetch stderr. Treat it as a promisor/credential problem on the
    runner checkout, not as a base-SHA problem.
do_not_redo:
  - >
    Do NOT make `classification=unknown` permissive to unpin the fleet. It
    would let a genuinely PR-owned red merge. The fix is to make
    classification work.
  - >
    Do NOT give the replay repository a promisor remote or copy the runner's
    `http.<url>.extraheader` into it. The replay borrows an odb precisely so it
    has no network configuration and no capability — a base manifest's ordinary
    `git fetch origin main` must not be able to reach live main, and the child
    env allowlist exists to keep Actions/OIDC tokens out. Hydrate in the head
    checkout, which already holds both.
  - >
    Do NOT use `git rev-list --objects --missing=print` as the detector, and do
    NOT drop `GIT_NO_LAZY_FETCH=1` from the `cat-file` probe — without it the
    probe silently becomes the slow per-object fix and reports nothing missing.
  - >
    Do NOT convert the replay back to a linked worktree to dodge this. The
    isolation is deliberate and documented in `_exact_base_worktree`.
danger_areas:
  - >
    Any test of partial-clone behaviour needs a bare origin with
    `uploadpack.allowFilter=true`. Without it the server answers "filtering not
    recognized by server, ignoring" and hands back a COMPLETE clone — the test
    passes and pins nothing. The new regression asserts the missing-blob
    precondition for exactly this reason; do not weaken that assertion.
  - >
    `_bounded_detail` now carries child stderr into published semantic
    evidence. It stays bounded by SEMANTIC_DETAIL_MAX_BYTES and one-lined, but
    anything newly written to a failing command's stderr is now more visible.
  - >
    scripts/** is authority-changing: this PR needs main ITSELF green, not
    merely a base-inherited excuse.
  - >
    scripts/export_signal_contracts.py reads data/ for build_golden_signals().
    Running it in a SPARSE worktree rewrites site/factordata/contracts/
    golden_signals.json with ZERO symbols and silently truncates the committed
    artifact — hit and reverted during the #5874 conflict resolution.
    build_manifest() is pure, so only the golden-signals half needs a full tree.
---

Cold-stranger note: the surprise is not the fix, it is the detector. The natural
first move — `git rev-list --objects --missing=print <base>` — reports ZERO
missing objects on a tree with genuinely missing blobs, because a blob a partial
clone omitted is an *expected* absence. Anyone who starts there will conclude the
odb is fine and go looking at the base SHA, which is exactly the wrong end; the
SHA resolves perfectly (`rev-parse` and `log` both succeed) and only the working
tree materialization fails. Start instead from git's own stderr — captured, it
says `unable to read sha1 file of <path>` and names the blob.
