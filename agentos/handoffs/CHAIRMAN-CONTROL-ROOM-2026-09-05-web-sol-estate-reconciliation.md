ended_because: blocked
mission: >
  Reconcile, as of 2026-09-05T02:47:00Z through 2026-09-05T03:06:32Z, the
  governed Web-Sol source, host, browser, and Executive observations into one
  cold-start handoff without creating a new owner, release claim, or state store.
state_before: >
  WS:CHAIRMAN-CONTROL-ROOM already held P0B behind the same #432 to #359
  dependency edge. The prior handoff named an incorrect upstream path, and no
  current-install proof had been recorded for the installed browser-native estate.
changed:
  - path: agentos/handoffs/CHAIRMAN-CONTROL-ROOM-2026-09-05-web-sol-estate-reconciliation.md
    what: >
      Records one bounded as-of reconciliation: the corrected current source owner,
      the held integration chain, an opaque installed-stale-generation finding, and
      the ordered Web-Sol continuity DAG. It changes no source, runtime, browser,
      profile, provider, binding, or lifecycle state.

  - claim: >
      At the initial source observation, Mastermind protected source was
      46a24a1a4083b74bbde8876100a8ca1f720589a9 and the #432 successor source
      carrier was Draft PR #435 at head 242b5e97503482e133735bc639f1efc0b8aaa5ec.

    result: >
      #435 was DRAFT and behind current base; all five hosted checks were green and
      review 5115174047 by mastermindx-2 approved the same head. Those receipts do
      not release its current-base integration hold.

      The corrected integration owner is the bounded location for the live-seat

      change source ownership or implement the repair.

      five hosted checks or semantic review. The later candidate below advances proof only.

      compatibility section 5. Four security checks passed; required test run
      33940649267 was still running. PR remained Draft. GitHub reassociates review

      A Web-Sol native process and its private local socket existed at the observation

    result: >
      The process was browser-launched through the managed-browser parent chain and
      held an owner-only local socket. The installed native host/client and extension
      assets differ from protected source; the installed runtime lacks the protected
      native-host implementation file, while the protocol and instance modules match. Classify
      this only as INSTALLED_STALE_GENERATION / CURRENT_INSTALL_PROOF_ABSENT.

      The closed receipt validated; target_present and exact_conversation_loaded were
      false. This establishes neither HC0 session identity nor authentication failure,
      rate limiting, context exhaustion, deletion, or current-install proof. No
      foreground, target selection, retry, message, provider or binding effect occurred.

unverified:
  - claim: >
      #435 is integrated into current protected master and can release the existing
      #359 host continuation.
    what_would_verify: >
      The existing #432 task must resolve its current-base hold on the same carrier,
      achieve protected current-base integration under the strict test/admin policy,
      and receive a fresh lawful release before #359 performs any new gate.
  - claim: >
      The installed browser-native estate is a current protected Web-Sol generation.
    what_would_verify: >
      The existing INSTALL1 owner must produce the issue's actual two-profile
      install/readback/fault/rollback receipts from protected source. No installed-proof
      runner exists at the observed pin; that absence is not an additional admission
      gate or permission to create one. The existing renderer supplies pure bundles only.
  - claim: >
      A provider conversation is the canonical Web-Sol action target or can receive a rotation.
    what_would_verify: >
      The existing target owner must resolve one exact eligible predecessor, and the
      disposable PF-1 procedure must prove provider semantics. Duplicate tab URLs and navigation
      bindings are locator facts, not target identity or message authority.
unresolved:
  - "The old #435 merge ref 499ba438962dd9342f8dde60e9360969a6f839bd had parents 22b36b830bd5560942186ada7597508f918696af and 242b5e97503482e133735bc639f1efc0b8aaa5ec. New candidate 6f632325 composes current base but still needs concluded required tests, compatibility review and explicit release."
  - "Protection requires the strict test and enforces administrators; five green hosted checks and same-head approval do not overcome DRAFT / HOLD-FOR-CURRENT-BASE-INTEGRATION."
  - "The precise installed estate is not absent, but the observed generation is stale relative to protected source and lacks current-install proof."
  - "CLAUDE CLI PF1-F0 PR #455 is distinct from Web PF-1 issue #338; neither may be substituted for the other."
  - "HC0 PR #247 remains on its original carrier C0BRDFZPLHK/1788311510.473749. The legacy navigation target was not recovered; HC0_SESSION_TARGET_UNRESOLVED / RUNTIME_BINDING_RECONCILIATION_REQUIRED persists until the original owner recovers exact operation, PR/head and START-bound session/account evidence."
  - "The existing navigation binding classifies an opaque ChatGPT1 CEO row for WS:CHAIRMAN-CONTROL-ROOM as NON_PROJECT. It is navigation-only and does not establish a canonical Sol chat, target, account, or authority."
next_actions:
  - "Keep the existing #432 task as the only source carrier; reconcile its current-base hold through the corrected integrations/chairman_surfaces/chatgpt.py owner and return a typed same-carrier result or hold."
  - "After protected current-base integration and a fresh lawful release, let the existing #359 operation alone re-read its prerequisites and return the bounded host preflight and local-bootstrap boundary; do not start a replacement host task."
  - "After #359 and the discrete profile/account gates complete lawfully, execute Web PF-1 A/B (#338), INSTALL1 (#340), then Web PF-1 C before any CR-P1 work."
  - "For CR-P1, prove exact same-profile/same-Project successor and deterministic bootstrap without RuntimeBinding transfer; then require canonical ACK/CAS before CR-B1, CR-D1, and any approved real rotation."
  - "Complete INSTALL1 through its existing issue and exact host/profile owner; pure bundle rendering alone is not installation evidence."
do_not_redo:
  - "Do not duplicate an occupied source, host or profile operation. #432 and #359 remain the existing carriers; permitted profile creation stays with #359. Do not create another controller, registry, lifecycle or Agent OS workstream."
  - "Do not modify the two paths owned by existing Macro correction PR #6816, head f3ec2582532b80a664911141e8fe25f378aa8d34, or treat its held root 1788494388.342559 as a release."
  - "Do not replace the versioned closed Web-Sol extension/native mechanism with OpenClaw, Responses API, generic browser automation, or ordinary Chrome. OpenClaw is optional upstream reuse; Responses API is separate from ChatGPT Web."
  - "Do not expose or persist profile paths, profile identifiers, URLs, account text, PIDs, command arguments, cookies, or authentication material."
  - "Do not treat a process, socket, manifest, extension preference, locator, review, CI success, merge ref, or CONTINUE as current install proof, target authority, provider result, source release, or host START."
danger_areas:
  - "The stale workstream text named the wrong integration path. Reuse only integrations/chairman_surfaces/chatgpt.py for this source-repair ownership question."
  - "A browser-spawned process and owner-only socket can look like full installation proof. They establish a bounded installed-estate observation only; mismatched native/extension hashes retain CURRENT_INSTALL_PROOF_ABSENT."
  - "Two identical Project URLs require ambiguity reconciliation; title and recency cannot select an action target. Current exact-target identity must come from the existing owner."
  - "The Executive fixture-mode read is degraded context. It cannot infer runtime jobs, leases, admission, or a CEO destination."
  - "CR-P1 is browser-side successor/bootstrap work; it cannot inherit RuntimeBinding or canonical ACK/CAS authority."

## §0 State at the observation boundary

This is an as-of reconciliation for 2026-09-05T02:47:00Z through 2026-09-05T03:06:32Z, not a claim about later state. The source repair advanced from semantic head 242b5e97 to current-base candidate 6f632325 during this interval, while remaining Draft and held pending required integration tests, compatibility review and release. The only host continuation remains pre-start and effect-free. The native browser estate is present but stale against protected source, so it supplies no current-install or provider proof. Its closed native INSPECT returned TARGET_NOT_FOUND for the existing navigation locator. HC0 remains on its original carrier with its operation-bound session unresolved; no replacement target was selected.

The complete ordered continuity DAG is:
```text
#435 current-base integration
  -> #359 read-only preflight, then separately authorized local bootstrap
  -> #359 governed profile_B provision and eligible disposable account/Project release
  -> Web PF-1 A/B (#338)
  -> INSTALL1 (#340)
  -> Web PF-1 C
  -> CR-P1 exact successor/bootstrap
  -> #355 existing Executive/OHF writer and trusted ACK bridge
  -> CR-B1 canonical ACK/CAS
  -> CR-D1
  -> separately approved real rotation
```
## §1 What is LEFT — in order

1. The exact #432 source task must resolve its current-base hold on the existing carrier through `integrations/chairman_surfaces/chatgpt.py`; no substitute carrier may modify it.
2. A protected current-base result and fresh lawful release precede the already-bound #359 worker's read-only preflight and separate local-bootstrap boundary.
3. Only after the profile/account gate sequence completes may Web PF-1, installation proof, CR-P1, canonical acknowledgement, and real rotation be considered in DAG order.
Issue #355 remains the existing deferred ChatGPT binding/readiness bridge. The current RuntimeBinding provider projection admits only `openai-codex`; the Executive/OHF writer exists, but ChatGPT registration is unsupported. The existing Wake ACK owner requires a trusted worker-local projection that ChatGPT has not proven. Its CB-F0/W1/A1/D1/I1 verticals preserve those owners before CR-B1; browser response text cannot substitute for semantic ACK.

The existing `bootstrap-peer-lifecycle` command can create or reconcile fixed private lifecycle/fence/witness records after its confirmation boundary. It has no Keychain, vendor, profile or account effect, but is not globally read-only. Keep the read-only preflight, this bounded local bootstrap, and later profile_B START distinct; do not revive `enroll-seats` or the six-private-input ceremony.

## §2 What will bite you

The old #435 merge ref could not prove current-base integration. New candidate 6f632325 composes the protected base but remains Draft/held until required integration checks conclude and release is consumed. GitHub reassociating an existing review with that commit is not a new review event.

The installed client is neither proof of absence nor current deployment. It is a closed-bundle generation mismatch; do not inspect broader browser state to compensate because precise estate identifiers and account content are intentionally absent.
## §3 What was decided and found
No decision or discovery was minted. Existing DEC:CHAIRMAN-CONTROL-ROOM-P0-ARCHITECTURE-ACCEPTED,
DEC:CCR-P0B-AUTOMATION-OWNED-NONSEAT-CANARY-ONLY, and DEC:CCR-SOL-IDENTITY-IS-NOT-A-CHAT
continue to bound the work. DSC:CCR-MANAGED-BROWSER-RUNNING-SEAT-ACTUATOR-MISSING
records historical missing-actuator evidence; only current source law governs execution.
## §4 Not in scope — do not adopt

This W1 reconciliation did not merge, change source, alter a host/profile, select a browser target, read a conversation, send a provider request, modify a navigation binding, or create an Executive/Agent OS authority mechanism. It does not make the installed process current or reopen ASD, OpenClaw, or Responses API lanes.
