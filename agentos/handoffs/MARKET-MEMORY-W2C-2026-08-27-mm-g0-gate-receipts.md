mission: >
  MM-G0, the first claimed child wave of the sustained Fable COO Market Memory program:
  settle the natural 2026-08-25 W2C M0D gate from authentic production receipts as exactly
  one of PASS / FAIL / ABSTAINED / NEVER_RAN, or honestly retain RECEIPT_UNRESOLVED.
  Read-only against production throughout. Classification is proposed to Sol, who adjudicates.
state_before: >
  Operation market-memory-full-capability-20260827-sol-001 was COMMISSIONED_DURABLY / UNCLAIMED
  on Macro DRAFT PR #6528 with four canonical records. Sol had searched GitHub, Macro issue
  comments since 2026-08-25, W2C PR comments and Slack hot state and found no accepted August-25
  M0D receipt, correctly ruling that absence insufficient to infer NEVER_RAN and holding the gate
  at RECEIPT_UNRESOLVED / BUILT_NOT_PROVEN. WS-MARKET-MEMORY-W2C still projected the now-past
  2026-08-25 04:00-04:32Z natural gate as future. Nobody had looked at the production host.

unverified:

    what_would_verify: "Nothing retrospective. The transcript was discarded at 04:05:00Z on 2026-08-25 and cannot be reconstructed. Only persisting seal_state.transcript (defect D1) and then reading the NEXT abstention's own receipt can answer it."
  - claim: "Whether the v2 seal window [04:00:00Z, 04:05:00Z) is wide enough or correctly placed for the massive_rest SPY unadjusted_daily source to deliver a stable bar."
    what_would_verify: "MM-S1 source-clock census against vendor publication timing, once D1 makes per-observation status visible. Do not infer it from v1 - v1 observes 26 minutes later under the clock M0B classified SOURCE_CLOCK_IMPOSSIBLE."
  - claim: "That the 04:32:00 UTC experience-v2 timer is the authentic M0D natural-gate writer."
    what_would_verify: "Sol confirming the gate definition against the M0C/M0D freeze. Taken here from the recharter's own 04:00-04:32Z window statement; it is falsifier #3 in the evidence record."
unresolved:
  - "RELEASE-CONTROL VIOLATION, 2026-08-28. Sol posted a REQUEST_REPAIR hold on PR #6583 at 01:51:06Z (do not merge; disarm automatic release; hold HOLD-FOR-SOL). The PR merged at 02:08:03Z - 17 minutes later - via the merge-on-green label armed at ~01:09Z, before the hold existed. Root cause: an armed automatic release combined with an hourly thread-watch tick, so the hold could not reach the session before its own automation fired. Not repairable by history rewrite; corrected forward by this repair carrier. Standing rule adopted: never arm merge-on-green or any auto-release on a carrier whose content the commissioning authority has not explicitly accepted, and never let a watch cadence be slower than the automation it is supposed to be able to interrupt."
  - "Sol must adjudicate the proposed ABSTAINED classification before WS-MARKET-MEMORY-W2C durable state is reconciled. This wave deliberately did not touch that workstream's status/waves/next_action."
  - "Defect D1 (seal discards its transcript) is established but NOT repaired - it needs its own modifying child operation and carrier from Sol."
  - "Defect D2 (technicals-v2 exits 1 on a lawful no-admit) is established but NOT repaired - same."
  - "Defect D3 (v2 chain has never admitted, 0/3 real sessions) is established as a fact but its cause is undiagnosable until D1 lands. D1 gates D3."
  - "This handoff is filed against WS:MARKET-MEMORY-W2C, not the parent WS:MARKET-MEMORY, because Agent OS joins are FAIL-CLOSED and both WS-MARKET-MEMORY.md and DEC-MARKET-MEMORY-CEO-RECHARTER-AND-NO-REBUILD-FREEZE.md exist only on unmerged DRAFT PR #6528. Filing against W2C does not broaden W2C - the M0D gate is inside its existing producer/technical scope. Re-point this handoff at WS:MARKET-MEMORY and restore the DEC citation once #6528 merges."
next_actions:
  - "Sol: adjudicate ABSTAINED vs any alternative reading, using the four falsifiers in the evidence record section 7."
  - "Sol: decide whether D1 is opened as the next modifying child wave. Recommended - it is small, and it is a precondition for any honest MM-S1 source-plane work. Scope it precisely: D1 did NOT cause the gate's prior RECEIPT_UNRESOLVED state - unrecovered host/store receipts did, and MM-G0 has now resolved the terminal gate to ABSTAINED. D1 destroys the CAUSE of an abstention, one layer down."
  - "Sol: decide whether D2 rides with D1 (same file family, same lawful-no-admit semantics) or gets its own carrier."
  - "After the RULING, reconcile WS-MARKET-MEMORY-W2C: retire the stale future-dated 2026-08-25 gate projection and record the adjudicated disposition."
  - "MM-S1 must not begin source-plane cause analysis before D1 lands - it would be guesswork against destroyed evidence."
do_not_redo:
  - "Do not re-search GitHub, Linear, Agent OS or Slack for an August-25 M0D receipt. It is not there and never was; the receipt lives on the production host at 146.190.142.17 in journalctl and /var/lib/macro-market-memory/state/experience-v2/records/2026-08-24.json."
  - "Do not treat the technicals-v2 exit-1 failure as the gate's FAIL. It is downstream of an already-not_eligible seal, so the natural chain was never eligible; the writer still reached a lawful terminal result."
  - "Do not read the v1 control arm's successful 2026-08-24 admission as proof that v2 should have admitted. v1 observes at 04:30:07Z under external_clock_authenticated=false and clock_model=session_ordinal_only_no_fabricated_market_close_timestamp - the exact clock v2 exists to replace."
  - "Do not conclude 'the vendor had no bar' from reason='no valid bar observation in seal window'. That string is emitted identically for transport_error, no_bar and malformed."
  - "Do not manually run, enable, restart or backfill the v1/v2 source/technical/experience writers to manufacture proof."
  - "Do not read current /opt/macro HEAD as the gate revision - it resets to FETCH_HEAD every ~3 minutes; use the reflog entry in force at the instant."
  - "Do not assume a missed timer fire would have been made up later - all three timers are Persistent=no."
danger_areas:
  - "Conflating the terminal gate classification with the causal diagnosis. These are two layers: the gate was RECEIPT_UNRESOLVED because host/store receipts had not been recovered (now resolved to ABSTAINED), whereas D1 destroys the CAUSE of an abstention. The first version of these records merged the two and had to be repaired; do not reintroduce it."
  - "sources-spy-rest-v1/ and technicals-v2/ being empty looks like a broken deploy. It is not - it is the correct on-disk consequence of a chain that has never admitted, because both stores are written only on the eligible path."
  - "The abstention is byte-identical across causes. Any future session that reads a Market Memory v2 abstention as a market fact will be wrong roughly as often as it is right, until D1 lands."
  - "technicals-v2 is red at the systemd layer on every real trading session. A standing red camouflages a genuine breakage - do not tune it out, fix D2."
  - "experience-v2's private namespace intentionally hides unbound v1 siblings via optional InaccessiblePaths. That is the repaired form; do not revert it because a sibling appears absent."
  - "The gate window is UTC and the sealed session is D, sealed at D+1 04:00Z. Off-by-one on that convention makes a Monday session look like a Sunday and turns a real defect into an apparent no-op."
  - "Weekday matters: sessions 2026-08-22 and 2026-08-23 are Sat/Sun and their not_eligible verdicts are CORRECT. Only 08-24, 08-25 and 08-26 are evidence of anything."

# MM-G0 — the August-25 gate ran, abstained, and shredded its own reason

**Verdict: `ABSTAINED`.** High confidence, two independent evidence classes, four named falsifiers.

The gate's prior `RECEIPT_UNRESOLVED` state was a recovery gap — not a property of the gate, and
not a consequence of any defect below it. Every prior search looked at GitHub, Slack, Linear and
Agent OS, none of which the writer posts to. The writer posts to
`/var/lib/macro-market-memory/state/experience-v2/records/` and to the systemd journal, and both
have said `abstained` since `2026-08-25T04:32:03Z`. Recovering those receipts is the whole of what
moved the terminal classification.

What is genuinely unrecoverable is one level down. The seal that caused the abstention computed a
complete per-observation transcript, evaluated it, logged a one-line summary, and returned without
persisting any of it. So we can prove *that* the chain abstained and *that* the abstention was
lawful, and we cannot prove *why* — not now, and not ever for this date.

That distinction is the whole value of this wave, and it separates two layers that must never be
collapsed: the **terminal gate classification** is settled (`ABSTAINED`, from recovered receipts),
while the **causal diagnosis** beneath it is permanently destroyed for every date already covered.
D1 belongs wholly to the second layer and has no bearing on the first.

It also inverts the natural next step: the interesting question is a source-plane question, but
source-plane archaeology is currently impossible. Fix the receipt first, then the next abstention
answers the question by itself.

`research/MARKET_MEMORY_MM_G0_AUG25_GATE_RECEIPTS_2026-08-27.md`.
