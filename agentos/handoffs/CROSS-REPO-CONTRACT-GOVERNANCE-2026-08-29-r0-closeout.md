workstream: "WS:CROSS-REPO-CONTRACT-GOVERNANCE"
session: sol/crg-r0-recovery-20260829
model: sol
ended_because: complete
mission: >
  Recover the stalled CRG R0 release gate, make the accepted records-only architecture
  durable on Macro main, reconcile the false Agent OS awaiting-CI projection, and leave
  the exact principal-placement continuation recoverable without claiming worker execution.
state_before: >
  PR #6596 had exact-head green CI and a prior Sol PASS but remained Draft because the
  connected GitHub mark-ready mutation failed on a GraphQL response-schema defect. No
  Fable principal ACK/START/Worker claim existed. Agent OS still described R0 as awaiting_ci.

  - path: agentos/workstreams/WS-CROSS-REPO-CONTRACT-GOVERNANCE.md
    what: >
      Mark R0 complete at accepted merge 2a45075ddb1139d3bcab6c6402f483040e0f6378,
      preserve that R0 repaired zero production seams, and advance the exact next action to
      lawful Fable principal placement before CRG-NW-AUTHORITY-V1.
verified:
  - claim: "R0 exact carrier was accepted and merged."
    command: "GitHub PR #6596 exact-head release review + expected-head squash merge."
    result: >
      PASS — accepted head 3aa76becc43a4fab7599e5f8e377979f81622beb; fences/ci,
      contract-delta, both trusted executor packs and ci-gate green; merge SHA
      2a45075ddb1139d3bcab6c6402f483040e0f6378 is current Macro main immediately after merge.

    command: "Grok Secretary bounded UI child crg-r0-draft-ready-ui-unblock-20260829-sol-001 plus canonical GitHub reread."
    result: >
      PASS — one Ready-for-review transition only; canonical GitHub confirmed draft=false,
      merged=false and unchanged head before Sol merge. Grok child received terminal SOL ACCEPTED / STOP.
  - claim: "R0 architecture remained current enough to merge after the recovery delay."
    command: "Fresh three-repository source-law spot checks before release."
    result: >
      PASS — Macro engine/neuralweb/mastermind_context.py still states all five Portfolio
      authority booleans FALSE/context-only; current Portfolio brain/neural_web_context.py
      still defaults prompt context ON and decision mode to shrink while config/authority_map.yml
      describes MASTERMIND_NW_DECISION as default-off/dark. Terminal moved only through unrelated
      China OHLC ownership work since the R0 census pin. CRG-01 therefore remains genuinely BROKEN.

    command: "Slack exact-operation search for crg-fable-principal-20260828-sol-001."
    result: "PASS — no prior Slack carrier/ACK/START/RESULT found for the principal operation."

    command: "Grok Secretary read-only Mac provider/session census crg-fable-placement-census-20260829-sol-001 plus Sol carrier reconciliation."
    result: >
      PASS — NO_ELIGIBLE_CAPACITY / effect=NONE. Claude5 and Claude6 were live with active work;
      Claude3, Claude4 and Claude8 retained existing parked/exact-session obligations and were not
      lawful new-work receivers; no unambiguous idle Fable-designated RuntimeBinding existed.
      The census child received terminal SOL ACCEPTED / STOP and created no principal delivery.
unverified:
  - claim: "A concrete eligible Fable receiver is currently available after the last census."
    what_would_verify: >
      A fresh provider/session placement census after material capacity movement yielding one
      unambiguous eligible receiver, followed by deliberate lawful delivery and that receiver's
      ACK/readback; until then the principal operation remains UNCLAIMED / WAITING_CAPACITY.
  - claim: "CRG-01 is repaired."
    what_would_verify: >
      A separately commissioned CRG-NW-AUTHORITY-V1 child, accepted code/contracts/conformance
      on exact heads, and required real producer-consumer proof. R0 merge proves none of this.
unresolved:
  - >-
    The canonical Executive worker route remains production_armed=false, so no Executive Job/Worker
    claim may be invented for CRG principal placement.
  - >-
    The last live Fable placement census found NO_ELIGIBLE_CAPACITY. Keep the parent active with
    capacity re-entry attention; do not double-book an occupied/exact-session Claude seat and do not
    ask the Chairman to allocate a routine numbered account.
  - >-
    CRG-02 imported Macro generation identity, CRG-03 reverse publication ownership, Prophet proof,
    Terminal washout authority, older Terminal formal contract gaps and the final production dossier
    remain open after CRG-01 in the bounded wave order.
next_actions:
  - >-
    Sol: watch for material Fable-capacity movement and perform a fresh bounded placement census only
    when one of the current seat obligations changes materially. If exactly one eligible concrete
    session is then lawfully identified, deliberately deliver the existing principal handoff, require
    ACK/read/watch/START, and keep Slack delivery distinct from execution.
  - >-
    After actual principal claim, perform a fresh collision census and commission only
    CRG-NW-AUTHORITY-V1 as the first R1 implementation child.
  - >-
    Sol reviews every principal/child BLOCKED, DECISION_REQUEST and RESULT on the same lawful carrier
    and issues exactly one explicit CONTINUE/REPAIR/STOP edge; never leave the program idle after a return.
do_not_redo:
  - "Do not recreate R0, the semantic program, or the Agent OS workstream."
  - "Do not create a central Contract Governance runtime, gateway, queue, scheduler, registry or release gate."
  - "Do not rebuild portfolio/prophet_feed.py; its remaining problem is contract/proof, not absence."
  - "Do not treat Direct Terminal -> Portfolio as a missing feature; it remains REJECTED_BY_DESIGN."
  - "Do not call R0 merge production seam completion."

# CRG R0 closeout

Before this recovery, the accepted R0 carrier existed but was stuck behind a Draft-only GitHub UI gate,
and Agent OS could not truthfully say that the durable CRG execution home had landed. After this recovery,
R0 is durable on Macro main at `2a45075ddb1139d3bcab6c6402f483040e0f6378` and the organizational
continuation can move to actual principal placement. The first post-R0 live placement census found no
eligible Fable capacity, so the principal remains explicitly unclaimed rather than silently orphaned.
This is a records-only capability delta: it makes CRG recoverable and governed across sessions, but
repairs zero production seams.
