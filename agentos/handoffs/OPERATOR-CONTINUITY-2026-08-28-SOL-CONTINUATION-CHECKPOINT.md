ended_because: blocked
state_before: >
  The prior Sol chat became unreliable and handed the Operator Continuity & Realm Rebinding
  program to this continuation session (see OPERATOR-CONTINUITY-2026-08-28-SOL-SESSION-HANDOFF).
  OCR-1 PR #184 was pending acceptance, the CF2-H0 native ceremony was blocked on the
  carrier-vs-repair identity pin collision, and OCR-2C Family A remained under falsification.
changed:
  - path: agentos/handoffs/OPERATOR-CONTINUITY-2026-08-28-SOL-CONTINUATION-CHECKPOINT.md
    what: >
      This continuation checkpoint itself: protected-truth pins, the #184 acceptance record,
      open commission inventory, capability ledger, and the exact next Chairman/Sol actions.
verified:
  - claim: "OCR-1 PR #184 is merged into protected Mastermind master as 1d5ad124."
    command: >
      git -C Mastermind merge-base --is-ancestor
      1d5ad1249172e8b93882f0dff157fc13636dd62d origin/master
    result: >
      Exit 0 — 1d5ad124 is an ancestor of protected master, matching this record's
      protected_truth pin (re-run 2026-08-28 during the schema repair of this record).
unverified:
  - claim: "#184 provides real production capability."
    what_would_verify: >
      Natural production proof of the preflight family; the record itself states
      BUILT_NOT_PROVEN / PRODUCTION_INERT.
  - claim: The three open commissions (H0 pin-split, OCR-1 Task 4, OCR-3 Task 1) are being executed.
    what_would_verify: >
      Chairman binds concrete seats in the named Slack threads and a same-carrier ACK/START
      plus typed returns appear; commissions are OPEN_PICKUP and intentionally unstarted.
unresolved:
  - CF2-H0 native host ceremony stays blocked until the CARRIER_COMMIT_SHA vs REPAIR_MERGE_SHA source-law collision is repaired and merged.
  - OCR-1 Task 4, OCR-3 Task 1 replacement, and the H0 pin-split repair all await Chairman concrete receiver binding.
  - OCR-2C Family B remains a design gate; no v2 Provider Control contract may be written before Chairman approval.
next_actions:
  - Chairman binds eligible seats to threads 1787966023.775079 (H0 pin-split), 1787966366.604899 (OCR-1 Task 4), and 1787965301.900189 (OCR-3 Task 1); Sol watchers adjudicate each typed return on the same carrier.
  - Sol presents the OCR-2C Family B Shared AI Provider Control architecture for Chairman approval before any implementation.
do_not_redo:
  - Do not rebuild any plane listed under hard_no_rebuild_boundaries below; Executive OS alone owns lifecycle, and provider/account/host change means a NEW Attempt.
  - Do not satisfy the H0 current-origin gate by relabelling the newest protected commit as the repair merge.
  - Do not grant the terminated OCR-3 watcher or any stale watcher continuation/retry/successor authority.
danger_areas:
  - No sudo/native H0 ceremony before the pin-split source repair merges under Sol review; passwords/device approvals are entered locally and never pasted into Slack/chat/transcripts.
  - Conversation state is never transplanted across provider/account/auth-home/host changes.
mission: >
  Continue Chairman-approved Operator Continuity & Realm Rebinding through real production acceptance without
  redesigning architecture #181, duplicating lifecycle/identity/queue/session/watcher planes, or conflating
  repository proof with live capacity, rollover, Steward, Slack or OpenClaw capability.

    OCR-1 PR #184 is now ACCEPTED and MERGED. Sol reconciled the same carrier against protected
    f61ced39d47f935b1dea369bd3ed25e06c954d08, refreshed without force/rebase, and reviewed exact head
    6b37ff6bfff202c19bfc3fe16a8e048f9ec80457. Direct current-parent delta was exactly
    ops/executive_os/claude-worker-preflight.py (+549) and tests/test_claude_worker_preflight.py (+541).
    Exact-head repository test, CodeQL and language analyses all passed. Sol recorded current-source PASS and
    squash-merged #184 as 1d5ad1249172e8b93882f0dff157fc13636dd62d. The temporary #184 watcher is disabled.
  - >
    #184 capability state is BUILT_NOT_PROVEN / PRODUCTION_INERT only. It establishes the closed
    mastermind.claude_worker_preflight.v1 family and fail-closed provider-work-free preflight behavior; it proves
    no real Claude realm, Worker-context auth, capacity identity, routing, provider work, rollover, Slack continuity
    or Steward/OpenClaw behavior.

    Fresh OCR-1 Task 4 storeless realm-set verifier is commissioned in Slack #agent-dispatch parent
    1787966366.604899 under operation operator-continuity-ocr1-task4-realm-set-verify-20260828-sol-001.
    It is OPEN_PICKUP / PREFERRED_AVENUE Terra / ACCOUNT_BINDING CHAIRMAN_SELECTS / CAPACITY_SELECTABLE and
    intentionally unstarted until Chairman binds an eligible concrete Terra-capable seat. Scope is exactly
    ops/executive_os/claude-realm-set-verify.py + tests/test_claude_realm_set_verify.py, RED-first with a mandatory
    tests-only hosted RED stop before implementation. A bounded Sol continuation watcher is armed for that thread.
  - >
    The prior OCR-3 child operator-continuity-ocr3-task1-20260828-sol-001 remains terminal. Sol re-affirmed STOP
    after a late post-STOP WATCH_ARMED message, denying that stale watcher any continuation/retry/successor authority.
    Fresh OCR-3 Task 1 replacement remains open in Slack parent 1787965301.900189 under operation
    operator-continuity-ocr3-task1-red-rebuild-20260828-sol-002, OPEN_PICKUP / Terra / CHAIRMAN_SELECTS /
    CAPACITY_SELECTABLE. It is tests-only RED-first and currently awaits Chairman concrete receiver binding.
  - >
    All Sol-side temporary watches remain attention/transport only. They never create Executive lifecycle state,
    account selection, retry/failover, merge or next-wave authority and must terminate after explicit child STOP.

  truth: >
    PR #200 remains the accepted H0 source-closure/generation-repair identity and merged as
    e53f524230ffc4e8730c844f6fc319d50a2050f3. Protected Mastermind subsequently advanced through #202 and now #184.
    Those later changes do not redefine the immutable repair provenance. The current H0 ceremony source still
    overloads one REPAIR_MERGE_SHA as both exact current protected carrier and immutable repair identity, so the
    native ceremony is BLOCKED until that source-law collision is repaired. Do not satisfy the current-origin gate
    by falsely relabelling the newest protected commit as the repair merge.
  repair_wave: >
    Slack parent 1787966023.775079 / operation cf2-h0-current-master-carrier-pin-repair-20260828-sol-001 is
    OPEN_PICKUP / PREFERRED_AVENUE CTO Sol / ACCOUNT_BINDING CHAIRMAN_SELECTS / CAPACITY_SELECTABLE. It is a
    bounded RED-first source-law repair splitting exact current protected CARRIER_COMMIT_SHA from immutable
    REPAIR_MERGE_SHA while preserving ancestry/reachability and exact authenticated H0 material mode/blob equality
    before any later privileged launch. It awaits Chairman concrete receiver binding; worker must re-pin current
    protected Mastermind at START because protected master has advanced since the commission was posted.
  chairman_boundary: >
    DO NOT run sudo/native H0 ceremony yet. First complete and merge the H0 pin-split source repair under Sol review.
    Only a later re-pinned runbook may authorize local administrator execution. Password/device approval must always
    be entered locally and never pasted into Slack/chat/transcripts.

  evidence: >
    Current merged Claude preflight exposes native auth readiness/plan-type metadata but no documented provider-
    supported secret-free stable subscription/enrollment identity. Macro Shared AI Provider Control uses static
    claude_code_oauth_N capability IDs/slot labels whose credential replacement does not itself change the capability
    ID or publish a non-secret enrollment generation. Provider docs establish unified Claude/Claude Code subscription
    usage and login/logout behavior, but not the rotation-safe cross-owner identity witness required by OCR-2C-A.
    Provider account/email/org/token/secret fingerprints remain forbidden. Therefore ordinal/name/config-path/plan-
    type matching cannot bind a native realm to a Macro capability.

    Sol prepares the Family B versioned Shared AI Provider Control design and presents it to Chairman for approval.
    Do not write/implement a v2 contract until that architectural design is explicitly approved/frozen. Existing
    mastermind.provider_capacity.v1, current H0/P0/CF2-I source law and Macro ownership remain unchanged.

  - OpenClaw remains optional subordinate hands and never gains lifecycle, account selection, failover, Slack identity, queue or memory authority.
  - V1 automatic quota rollover remains limited to canonically non-modifying Attempts; write-capable interruption or unresolved EFFECT_UNKNOWN forbids provider/account/host failover.

  Chairman binds one eligible concrete CTO-Sol-capable seat to H0 pin-split thread 1787966023.775079 and eligible
  Terra-capable seat(s) to OCR-1 Task 4 thread 1787966366.604899 and OCR-3 Task 1 thread 1787965301.900189 according
  to live quota availability. Sol watchers then adjudicate each RED/BLOCKED/RESULT on the same carrier. H0 source
  repair is the prerequisite to any native sudo ceremony. Independently, Sol presents OCR-2C Family B architecture
  for Chairman approval before any new versioned Provider Control contract/spec is written or implemented.
