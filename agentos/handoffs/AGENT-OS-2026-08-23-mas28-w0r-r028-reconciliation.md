mission: >
  Reconcile the canonical W0 R028 contradiction before W1 resumes: preserve
  PER_TARGET semantics while making each finding carry its exact MAS target identity,
  restamp the canonical ruleset/architecture/template contract, and durably record the
  supersession without touching the held W1 implementation.

  R028 was PER_TARGET at fixed SNAPSHOT:LINEAR but evidence contained only
  issue_type, portfolio_mode, and target_role, so distinct identical-shaped targets
  collapsed under finding uniqueness. W1 PR #6328 was open, deliberately unarmed, and
  held for exact source-law reconciliation.

      Adds the existing `target` ATOM to R028 evidence_keys only and reserializes the

      Separate bounded W1/Mastermind/Terminal carriers merge from protected heads and

unresolved:
  - "W1 PR #6328 must remain paused until W0R is on origin/main, then refresh rather than cherry-pick an unmerged law."
  - "W1 must rotate five old-digest pins (two observation-schema constants, one report-schema constant, the core frozen digest, and its digest golden), add target to the R028 contract/emitter/report schema, and add a hostile identical-shape two-target non-collapse test."
  - "Mastermind .github/pull_request_template.md plus tests/test_pr_linkage_authoring_template.py and Terminal .github/pull_request_template.md still name the prior contract/ruleset digests; propagate markers only, not a duplicate manifest or validator."
  - "The post-merge cutover receipt is necessarily external to the self-referential merge commit; root must coordinate the exact Linear comment after the proof PR is closed."
next_actions:
  - "After W0R merges, capture the exact Macro draft-prepopulation and cutover receipts, close/delete the proof carrier, and return them to root for one MAS-28 Linear comment."
  - "Then refresh W1 #6328 from the merged W0R law and require target in manifest schema, emitter, goldens and hostile two-target dedup tests before re-review."
  - "Update the Mastermind and Terminal template markers in separate repository-local PRs; do not copy the Macro manifest or create another truth store."
do_not_redo:
  - "Do not change R028 cardinality or location; exact `target` evidence is the canonical repair."
  - "Do not add a 45th evidence key, 47th rule, workflow, House-Law row, branch protection, merge gate, Linear mutation, control plane or second manifest."
  - "Do not touch or adopt the foreign W1 carrier dirt; W1 resumes only after W0R merges."
danger_areas:
  - "A new ruleset digest invalidates old marker receipts until each repository propagates the exact marker and records its own immutable cutover."
  - "Template blob SHA uses Git blob identity, while contract/ruleset markers use SHA-256 of exact file/canonical-manifest bytes; do not substitute one hash family for another."
  - "A fixed finding location cannot supply target identity; evidence must carry it before uniqueness reduction."

# Cold-session return point

Start from merged W0R, not from the held W1 branch. Verify the exact protected default head and
the root-coordinated cutover receipt, then reconcile W1's manifest schema/emitter/tests to require
`target` for R028. The rest of the V1 contract is frozen and remains REPORT_ONLY.
