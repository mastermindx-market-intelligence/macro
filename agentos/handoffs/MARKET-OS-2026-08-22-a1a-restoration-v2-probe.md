  Under Sol's semantic-v2 restoration ruling, execute exactly one authenticated

state_before: >
  DEC:MARKET-OS-A1A-RESTORATION-EQUALITY-EXCLUDES-SERVER-TIMESTAMPS was merged in
  PR #6280, but its required production probe had not run. The designated authenticated
  account held the sealed 13-row canonical Portfolio fixture, all 13 rows open, one
  duplicate group with one extra row, and four Watchlists with 134 memberships. No
  canonical Portfolio deletion was authorized; Scene 9 and A1B remained prohibited.
changed:
  - path: "Authenticated production semantic-v2 restoration probe"
    what: >
      Created one controlled explicit-id temporary Portfolio row, sealed it, deleted it
      with an exact returned-row receipt, restored the same identity and semantic fields
      through the existing authenticated owner-scoped path while omitting created_at and
      updated_at, proved that only those server timestamps changed, and permanently
      deleted the probe with another exact returned-row receipt. No canonical Portfolio
      row and no Watchlist row was mutated.

      Macro and Terminal agreed on the 14-row semantic seal

      The returned field set differed from the intended input set only by the two generated
      timestamp fields; both timestamp values changed and the full row changed, while every
      v2 identity and semantic field stayed exact. Macro and Terminal reproduced the original
      14-row shared semantic seal, ordered-id seal, and probe index exactly.

      The first verifier serialized the same fields in a different JSON key order and alone
      reported a different hash. Row count, owner, product semantic multiset, ordered ids,
      probe index, canonical remainder, timestamps, and both Watchlist seals were already
      exact. The corrected read-only canonicalizer returned the sealed probe fingerprint
      exactly; no production field or product disagreement existed.

do_not_redo:
  - "Do not repeat this semantic-v2 restoration probe; it passed and the temporary row is durably absent."
  - "Do not repeat PD1 mutation machinery; its accepted durable mutation and failure-honesty proof remains sufficient."
  - "Do not delete a canonical Portfolio row without fresh Sol action-time authority."
  - "Do not broaden the v2 exception beyond created_at and updated_at, or attempt to preserve either timestamp."
  - "Do not treat JSON key insertion order as product field drift; use the exact sealed canonicalizer before adjudication."
  - "Do not expose private Portfolio or Watchlist values; counts and fingerprints are sufficient."
danger_areas:
  - "The production table is portfolio_positions; a similarly named public.portfolio table does not exist."
  - "Semantic-v2 and product-conformance hashes require fixed field names, field order, numeric normalization, and multiset sorting; a different JSON insertion order produces a false mismatch."
  - "Macro and Terminal expose different field casing and independent Watchlist representations; normalize only through the sealed product-specific canonicalizers."
  - "Timestamp regeneration can affect incidental product order, so the authoritative ordered-id seal remains a separate hard invariant during canonical restoration."

# A1A authenticated production — semantic-v2 restoration probe

Verdict: **PASS / CLEAN / RETURN TO SOL.** The bounded one-row restoration proof
required by Sol's semantic-v2 ruling passed under the existing authenticated
owner-scoped production path. Identity, ownership, every semantic field, product
order, duplicate multiplicity, and both product-specific Watchlist baselines remained
exact; only the two server-generated timestamps changed, as the ruling requires.

The temporary row is durably absent. Immediate and delayed authenticated reads both
returned the original sealed 13-row canonical Portfolio fixture across Macro and
Terminal. No canonical Portfolio row was deleted, and no Watchlist mutation occurred.

This proves the restoration contract; it does not authorize the broader evacuation.
Return to Sol for fresh action-time destructive authority. Scene 9 remains prohibited,
A1B remains blocked, and A1A remains `in_progress` until the full production matrix is
executed and Sol explicitly accepts it.
