  GD-1A+1B hardened scientific replay of the August 2026
  duration/leadership/contagion episode at lawful clocks. No production
  mutation. No live Prophet/Portfolio authority.

  No research/grey_deer tree, no WS:GREY-DEER, no Sol architecture freeze
  on origin/main or GitHub. Fable packet
  GROK_GD1_HARDENED_SCIENTIFIC_REPLAY_PACKET_2026-08-19 commissioned the
  wave. Designated root was behind origin/main; worktree
  .grok/worktrees/gd1-event-replay fast-forwarded to origin/main before
  the freeze commit.

    what: >
      This handoff, reconciled into the canonical workstream by Fable COO
      (originally authored against a session-minted WS:GREY-DEER, which was
      dropped pre-merge: GD-0A #5963 landed WS:GREY-DEER-RISK-INTELLIGENCE
      as the one canonical program identity, and GD-1 is its wave GD-1A/GD-1B).
      A DSC recording "Sol freeze absent" was also dropped pre-merge — true at
      execution time, falsified by #5963's merge; its durable content moved to
      unresolved/body below.

    Clock nuance for acceptance: GD-1's hypotheses were frozen from the Fable
    command packet + prereg 663fb02b500c BEFORE Sol's architecture freeze
    landed on main (#5963 merged 2026-08-19T12:24Z, after this wave executed).
    The prereg remains the operative GD-H freeze for GD-1 results; any GD-H
    change made under the now-landed freeze requires a NEW prereg version.
  - GD-H1 design-era test not run (LC emission log too short).
  - Repair unresolved at cutoff.
  - GD-1 grants no live authority.
next_actions:
  - Fable accepts or amends this handoff. Do not start GD-2/3/4/5/6/7 without that.
  - Next research action if any: labeled truncate-and-recompute of leadership_crack.v1 on ≤2026-07-31 for GD-H1. Do not pick percentiles on August 2026.
  - If WI/000660/intraday boards remain missing, leave those legs BLOCKED.
do_not_redo:
  - Invent a substitute architecture freeze — the canonical one is research/grey_deer/GREY_DEER_RISK_INTELLIGENCE_ARCHITECTURE_FREEZE_2026-08-19.md (landed by #5963, after this wave's prereg).
  - Rename daily yield differences "auction tail".
  - Revive SLF-006 or D2 auction-rebound as if open.
  - Treat EWY as KOSPI cash.
  - Infer Prophet knew the crash from a defensive-looking 08-18 shelf.
  - Classify PBOC zero 7-day as tightening on this tape.
  - Grant live Prophet/Portfolio authority from this replay.
  - Tune any threshold on the current incident.
danger_areas:
  - latest.json / later nightly rewrites are recomputed history (see also DSC:BREADTH-LEDGER-REVISES-HISTORY for the general trap).
  - FRED DGS* is latest-revised.
  - Sparse worktrees truncate data/ if written without a full checkout — this wave used a full tree.
  - China Prophet 2026-08-17 board is missing; do not interpolate.

## Continuation packet for Fable

### Constructions worth implementing in GD-5

None under prereg §10 (no design-era PASS). Dual-read is a descriptive residue, not a builder commission. Auction-proxy interaction remains UNTESTED.

### Constructions rejected / refuted

- Standalone bad-auction → equities
- PBOC zero 7-day = tightening
- Prophet-knew / defensive-composition-as-forecast
- Absolute VIX threshold (already DNR)
- Any claim that needs WI tail, 000660.KS, or intraday boards

### Source / cadence / rights gaps

See `research/grey_deer/gd1/GD1_SOURCE_RIGHTS_AND_GAPS.md`. Load-bearing: WI tail, issuer tape, official buyback filing, LC prehistory, Anticipation/Velocity stores, CN radar August, FRED vintage, Prophet yahoo coverage 16%.

### Exact evidence that should enter GD-2 descriptive envelope now

- Dual-read timeline (LC BROKEN vs MS RISK_ON / RR calm)
- PBOC tool-migration classification with first_seen
- 2026-08-18 same-session H4 table
- Prophet gate-reason distribution
- EWY ≠ KOSPI clock warning

### Exact evidence that must remain shadow

Every sidecar policy, hazard probability, and new-entry restriction. The 11-name priced tech subset on 08-17→08-18.

### Policy counterfactual findings relevant to GD-6/7

No existing organ authorized a new-entry restriction. A sidecar on since 2026-07-17 would also have been on through the 2026-08-04 SMH bounce. Upside cost unmeasured. Not a policy.

### One next research action

Truncate-and-recompute `leadership_crack.v1` on 2016-01-04..2026-07-31 as `def_current_cf`, freeze design-era 80th percentiles, test GD-H1 with episode-level N. If PIT membership cannot be reconstructed, BLOCKED.

### Authority

**GD-1 grants no live market, Prophet, or Portfolio authority.**
