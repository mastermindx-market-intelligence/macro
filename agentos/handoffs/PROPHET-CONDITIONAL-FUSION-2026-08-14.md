  PR-1b: the frozen, counterfactual-replay-labelled, NON-promotion-bearing baseline
  race — G0/G0'/G1/G2/G3/G4 + C1 on the graded-board frame with the frozen O1-O6
  rulers and the PR-1a harness — answering the six commissioned architectural-triage
  questions, plus the still-open PR-1a §13.0 live-closure check. This file is the
  DAY's canonical handoff: the PR-0 and PR-1a session records are absorbed below
  (same-day handoffs amend in place; a suffixed second file is dropped by
  latest-wins ranking).
state_before: >
  PR-0 (#5593) and PR-1a (#5604) both merged 2026-08-14 (10:03Z / 11:33Z). No
  post-PR-1a-merge nightly had completed: daily.yml runs of 08-13T23:20Z and
  08-14T00:06Z still queued/pending with pre-merge heads. Candidates store: last
  CURATED stamp 2026-08-07 (79 scored rows); the 08-12 stamp is scan-tier-heal only
  (commit 071017a3). #5578 and #5583 PR-0s merged the same morning. The graded
  frame: retro_grades.parquet, 24 dates 06-15..07-31, H in {5,10,21}, 442 H=21 rows.

**Post-merge addendum (same session, ~22Z).** The operator merged #5667 directly at
21:16:57Z while its packs were mid-flight; the surviving evidence is the main-ref
ci.yml baseline dispatched on 622aeb30 (a descendant of the merge) — watched to
conclusion by this session. Because the PR edited `.github/ci/legacy-jobs.yml` (a
global invalidator), its full-suite runs surfaced four latent reds, all diagnosed
by job NAME: (1) house-law census — `check_stretch_oracle_contract.py` shipped by
#5574 unregistered; HEALED IN #5667 (registry entry + emitted-doc regen);
(2) neural-web — `docs/MASTERMIND_SYSTEM_MAP.md` stale vs `config/synapse.yml`
after #5655×#5625 crossed; HEALED IN #5667; (3) packing-contract ceiling —
`intelligence-registry` (#5620) curated scope carries a `scripts/*` smear (probe
127 > 126); a sibling re-opened headroom first, the verified 39-file narrowing is
chipped to the CI lane (task_68ce1829); (4) entry-radar W1 ownership guard
(#5625) asserted every PR's whole diff is radar-only — a sibling landed the
self-scoping heal in parallel (both diff guards now skip non-radar diffs). This
session's own miss, fixed on the branch pre-merge by a parallel actor and
verified on main: the race runner's conditional repo-root pin (import-pinning
law wants unconditional).

Cold-stranger summary: PR-0 froze the arena, PR-1a restored the sensory spine and
built the harness, PR-1b ran the first race. The race's one strengthened hypothesis:
the champion's 25-pt edge leg points the wrong way at H=10 on the only graded frame —
four independent constructions agree (G3 leads everything, G4 second, G1 last, C1's
F2 is the only CI-excluding-zero family and it is negative) — but every primary CI
includes zero on a frame whose minimum detectable effect (~17.4pp) dwarfs the
registered +3pp increment, so nothing here authorizes a production change. Next real
evidence arrives from forward accrual: the §13.0 closure, then PR-3's prospective
shadow race (G3/G4/C1/C1−F2, prereg'd in the Adjudication).

## Absorbed record — session 2 of 2026-08-14: PR-1a (prophet-fusion-pr1a, #5604)

The full PR-1a handoff, previously at PROPHET-CONDITIONAL-FUSION-2026-08-14-pr1a.md
(removed: suffixed same-day files are dropped by latest-wins ranking):

```yaml

model: fable
ended_because: ci_handoff
prs: ["#5604"]  # (the original file mistakenly listed #5593)
mission: >
  PR-1a of the fusion program: root-cause and fix the stalled US Context Vector
  accrual, ship the §13 telemetry columns, the canonical evidence-family registry
  (families.yml), and the arena harness skeleton with the frozen O1-O6 rulers and
  §9 validation law — all zero-authority, nothing touching Prophet's live rank path.
state_before: >
  PR-0 (#5593) merged 2026-08-14T10:03Z. Context-vector store had 4 stamped days
  (07-31, 08-05/06/07), nothing since — the nightly board ran while the store's
  fail-soft writer silently threw every night from 08-08.
changed:
  - engine/neuralweb/context_api.py — _regime_dim merge path emits SCALARS ONLY
    (dict-valued regime__live/regime__history was the root cause of every failed
    append since 08-08)
  - engine/us_context_vector.py — object-column NaN->None sweep; runtime containment
    quarantine with line-start ::warning; loud append-failure + quiet-append
    warnings; §13 telemetry columns (16, zero authority); §13.7 buy-lane
    reconciliation receipt
  - engine/confluence_tiers.py + engine/signal_gate.py — stoch_ob/stoch_bear/
    macd_bear per-leg null-state surfaced; gate DECISION byte-identity pinned by
    sha256 goldens from pre-edit HEAD
  - scripts/grade_us_prophet_candidates.py — nightly staleness tripwire
  - scripts/build_stock_library.py — telemetry load wiring (read-off only)
  - research/prophet_fusion/families.yml + tests — 8 families / 54 members / 180
    store columns homed exactly once; 34/34 mutation catches
  - scripts/prophet_fusion_arena.py + scripts/prophet_fusion_labels.py + tests —
    harness skeleton: labels O1/O2/O3/O5 (entry+confidence DEFERRED, never proxied),
    walk-forward folds with §9.2 refusal, PIT/contamination refusals, fold-scoped
    normalizer, coverage null!=zero, dummy end-to-end selftest; 82 tests
  - tests/test_us_prophet_grades.py — zero-authority fence allowlist +
    prophet_fusion_labels with rationale; label_only_stores declaration
  - .github/ci/legacy-jobs.yml — five suites registered
  - data/us_prophet_rank/README.md — new columns + regime__basis boundary
verified:
  - root cause reproduced empirically (dict-valued regime merge, not inferred)
  - producer can append a new nightly PIT row (scratch e2e: new stamp 3 rows; 7,759
    prior rows x 180 cols value-identical; keep-first idempotent; repo data/ untouched)
  - 285 tests green post-review; gate decisions byte-identical (mutation receipt)
  - audit_unrun_tests exit 0
  - opus adversarial review: 1 BLOCKER + 4 MAJOR resolved (sue_z de-listing; three
    silent no-advance paths -> line-start warnings; label_only_stores + red-on-rot
    test; disclosed_gaps.json store-scoped; hub/attention outage warnings); goldens
    independently reproduced 16/16
unresolved (still true after PR-1b):
  - catalyst_class / psq_stage / day3_mark_class SKIPPED (no same-night producer)
  - gex_state shipped as gex_confirm_verdict (three-vocabulary split risk)
  - live-ONLY regime path returns kitchen-sink dict (quarantined loudly if it fires)
  - insider panel + short-interest PIT chipped separately
  - review advisories A1/A3/A4/A5/A7 + registry wired_from + fold kwargs ->
    A1 and wired_from LANDED in PR-1b; the rest still open
do_not_redo:
  - do not re-diagnose the accrual stall (pinned by test) 
  - do not backfill the Aug 8-13 store hole (honest history)
  - do not add a catch-all pytest collector (suites are named by design)
danger_areas:
  - zero-authority fence allowlist now 5 entries; new importers need adjudication
  - regime__basis flips recomputed_history->pit_live at the 08-14 boundary
  - arena selftest synthetic metrics are fixture properties (dummy:true) — never findings
```

Cold-stranger summary (PR-1a): the store stalled because a context-dimension producer
began emitting nested dicts the parquet schema-union could not absorb, and the
writer's fail-soft caught the explosion silently every night. The fix makes the
producer scalar-only, quarantines unknown non-scalars loudly, and makes silence
itself alarm. Everything else is measurement scaffolding under frozen law.

## Absorbed record — session 1 of 2026-08-14: PR-0 (prophet-us-conditional-fusion-pr0, #5593)

*Plus the same-day si-pit chip session's in-place addendum (#5602, MERGED): the
`_short_int_dim` snapshot_not_pit landmine is FIXED for historical dates —
`engine/neuralweb/context_api.py` resolves them PIT against the history+panel union
gated on knowable_date (settlement + 10d), basis `pit_settlement`; current dates keep
`snapshot_not_pit`. Its sequenced follow-ups for this program: flip the families.yml
short_int member's `pit_status` → `pit_settlement` (deliberately not touched by
#5602), and re-run `scripts/backfill_finra_short_interest.py` before any deep
historical short_int join (committed history: 3 settlements, first knowable
2026-07-10).*

    maturation -> add sibling WS deps when #5578/#5583 merge (BOTH MERGED 08-14;
    prose refs can graduate to depends_on in the next WS touch)
```

Cold-stranger summary (PR-0): read the masterplan top-to-bottom (§0 ruling → §17
review); it is self-contained. The one live operational fact to check before building
anything: has the context-vector store stamped a night since 2026-08-07? If not,
§13.0 outranks everything else in PR-1a. (PR-1a fixed it; PR-1b left the closure
check open pending the first post-merge nightly.)
