mission: >
  Execute Sol return-gate 10: replace the current-snapshot intersection at the
  exact plane's pit_universe stage with source-union semantics, prove
  replay-invariance, then start a fresh PIT/exact attempt and drive one bounded
  canary to stage=complete through name_history and all five daily endpoints.
state_before: >
  Epoch frozen and live on main (mainland-joint-complete-v1 / 1992-01-01,
  19df24573e72) with the trade_cal plane cleanly rebuilt to 66/66 terminal units
  and 7,807 sessions. The zero-date sentinel fix merged (003e6b988f6f). The
  acceptance canary was blocked at pit_universe: bak_basic 20240102 measured
  5,344 = 5,342 + 0 + 2, quarantine must be zero for a terminal unit, and
  collect_spine stops at that stage, so stage=complete was unreachable. Both
  quarantined rows were classified bak_basic_absent_from_stock_basic_A_witness.

verified:
  - claim: The survivorship filter was encoded at THREE layers, not one
    command: "Traced the completeness manifest's `complete` conjunction term by term in collectors/china_tushare_spine.py"
    result: >
      CONFIRMED. :4913-4921 conjoins BULK_HISTORICAL_BACKFILL_READY,
      reference_ready, endpoints_complete, pit_lifecycle["complete"],
      coverage_receipt["complete"], canonical_event_substrate["ready"] and
      lifecycle["complete"]. Three terms carry the filter — the row classifier
      via endpoints_complete (quarantine must be zero), :4103
      _pit_lifecycle_reconciliation whose complete requires len(extra_in_pit)==0
      i.e. pit subset-of lifecycle, and :4851 coverage_receipt["complete"] which
      requires unexplained_missing_observations==0 while :4234 computes
      eligible = _eligible_tickers_with_pit(...) and missing = eligible - actual,
      so a landed PIT row that never traded becomes an unexplained coverage gap.
      Fixing only the classifier moves the failure two stages later.
  - claim: Two further conjunction terms need no change
    command: "Read collectors/china_tushare_spine.py:4352-4401 and :4811-4830"
    result: >
      PASS. _lifecycle_edge_reconciliation guards its before-list/after-delist
      checks with `if ticker in lifecycle.index`, so a master-absent ticker is
      skipped, and pit_list_date_mismatch compares a PIT row's own list_date to
      its own trade_date with no master involved (and skips null list_date).
      canonical_event_substrate derives from the daily tape, so a PIT-only
      never-traded row is simply absent from the join.
  - claim: The rest of the plane was already source-union and needs proof, not change
    command: "Read collectors/china_tushare_spine.py:2010, :2428, :3945, :4093"
    result: >
      PASS. _eligible_tickers_with_pit already returns lifecycle | pit;
      _instrument_scope_maps already folds landed PIT tickers into known_a, so
      name_history and the five daily endpoints inherit propagation;
      event_eligible = positive_volume & source_limits_present already IS the
      ruling's graded trading-authority test, so a PIT row without trading
      evidence is non-event-eligible by construction.
  - claim: A new derived column cannot break a strict schema assertion
    command: "grep KEY_COLUMNS / ENDPOINT_FIELDS / expected_columns in collectors/china_tushare_spine.py"
    result: >
      PASS. KEY_COLUMNS['bak_basic'] is only ['trade_date','ticker'], and the
      exact-column check at :2196 validates the RAW vendor response frame against
      requested fields, not the derived landed frame.
  - claim: The fresh-attempt surgery preserves the calendar and the reference generation
    command: "python3 scratchpad/pit_fresh_attempt.py (report-only dry run)"
    result: >
      PASS. Plan drops exactly the failed bak_basic unit plus bak_basic/,
      source_row_classification/quarantined_unknown/bak_basic/,
      receipts/requests/bak_basic/ and the derived completeness_manifest.json,
      while preserving trade_cal 66, stock_basic 12, fund_basic 3, bse_mapping 1
      and all 53 reference parquet files. The script refuses --apply without an
      existing backup and asserts no preserved plane is in its own plan.
  - claim: The failed unit wrote its landed partition despite being marked failed
    command: "Inventory of the private store's bak_basic plane"
    result: >
      CONFIRMED — bak_basic/year=2024/month=01/part.parquet exists at 441,196
      bytes for a unit whose status is `failed`. This is the same
      ledger-diverges-from-artifacts hazard recorded in
      DSC:CNLI-REPAIRED-SPINE-LEDGER-DIVERGES-FROM-ARTIFACTS and is why the
      ruling's fresh-attempt instruction is not cosmetic.
  - claim: The intersection semantics were NEVER covered by a test, which is why they survived to first vendor contact
    command: "grep -c absent_from_stock_basic_A_witness tests/test_china_tushare_spine.py; python3 -m pytest tests/test_china_tushare_spine.py -q"
    result: >
      CONFIRMED — the old classification string appears ZERO times in the test
      file, and the full suite reports 83 passed with the source-union collector
      change already in place and no pre-existing test modified. Removing the
      filter broke nothing because nothing exercised it: every ticker in the
      _bak_rows fixture is also present in _stock_basic_rows, so the
      witness-missing branch was unreachable from the suite. Same family as the
      three earlier canary defects in this lane — green tests, broken reality,
      invisible until real data arrived.
  - claim: The fail-closed half of the coverage check was already pinned by an existing test
    command: "grep -n unexplained_missing tests/test_china_tushare_spine.py"
    result: >
      PASS — tests at :1658 and :1817 assert unexplained_missing_observations of
      0 and 2 respectively, and both still pass under C6. Their securities are
      master-known, so the C6 carve-out (which only excuses witness-missing
      tickers) leaves them counting exactly as before. That :1817 assertion is
      the standing guard that C6 did not disable the coverage check wholesale.
  - claim: The ruling works on the LIVE vendor rows that blocked the program
    command: "Canary runs 33026747482 (2024-01-02) and 33026983388 (2018-01-02), then read the unit and the landed partition"
    result: >
      PASS, and this is the session's central evidence. bak_basic 20240102 is now
      status COMPLETE at source_row_count 5344 = landed_a 5344 + known_excluded 0 +
      quarantined_unknown 0, with witness_missing_row_count 2 and
      source_accounting_complete true -- the equation balances and quarantine is
      ZERO where it was 2. The landed partition carries exactly two rows with
      current_stock_basic_witness_missing True: 300114.SZ 中航电测 (list_date
      2010-08-27) and 603361.SS 浙江国祥 (list_date null via the zero sentinel).
      The column is dtype bool with ZERO nulls, so no row carries an unknown
      disposition. bak_basic then reached 2/2 terminal when the 2018-01-02 window
      landed as well, and daily and daily_basic reached 2/2. pit_universe,
      name_history and two daily endpoints have now all executed against the live
      vendor for the first time.
  - claim: The ci-authority/codex/merge-queue-pilot red on PR 6486 is by design
    command: "gh api repos/.../check-runs/98364660853"
    result: >
      PASS — context_reason `inactive_base_context` for base context
      codex/merge-queue-pilot, which this PR does not target. The binding
      ci-authority/main check passed with reason `ordinary_change`.
unresolved:
  - >
    SOL GATE 1 (authority, blocking) --
    DSC:CNLI-PRE-PIT-NAMECHANGE-ORPHANS-HAVE-NO-WITNESS. Scope it by the MEASURED
    RATE, not by the era: of ten attempted namechange year-units, 1990-1998 ALL
    reached terminal with ZERO quarantine (935 rows landed) and only 1999 failed,
    on exactly ONE row of 193 -- 1 orphan in 1,128 rows (0.09%), 19 later years
    still unattempted. So pre-2016 name history is otherwise clean; this is a
    handful of individual securities, not a systemic era failure. It is still
    fatal to completeness, because the manifest requires EVERY year from 1990 and
    one unclassifiable row blocks the whole thing. The 1999 unit failed at
    193 = 192 + 0 + 1 on 000991.SZ 通海高科, a security absent from the current
    5,888-row master. This is the SAME survivorship shape the source-union
    decision removed, reaching an era where that decision's MECHANISM does not
    exist -- the PIT witness starts 2016, so a 1999 row has no corroboration of
    any kind and admitting it would rest on identity derivation alone. Refusing
    it makes name_history permanently non-terminal, because the manifest requires
    every year from NAME_HISTORY_START_YEAR = 1990. Choosing an earlier canary
    date reduces the year count but never removes the pre-2016 years, so NO
    canary window can reach terminal while this stands. Not decided here: the
    standing instruction is to return a dependency the ruling did not address
    rather than widen it.
  - >
    BLOCKER 2 (technical, independent of gate 1).
    DSC:CNLI-STK-LIMIT-ZERO-PRE-CLOSE-SENTINEL: stk_limit spells the absent prior
    close of a non-trading instrument as `0`, and the shared price coercer
    requires positive, so one field kills a 3,466-row unit and aborts the run. A
    repair must decide the contradiction case explicitly -- what to do when the
    vendor publishes up/down limits WHILE pre_close is zero, which is a band with
    no anchor and should keep blocking.
  - >
    Whether the two measured rows split as expected on EVENT eligibility.
    300114.SZ and 603361.SS both now land witness-missing (confirmed), but
    event_eligible cannot be read yet because the canonical event substrate needs
    daily, daily_basic AND stk_limit complete, and stk_limit is blocked by
    blocker 2. Expected once unblocked: 300114.SZ event-eligible (it traded that
    session), 603361.SS not (no daily observation).
unverified:
  - >
    THREE of the six exact endpoints have still never executed against the
    vendor: stk_limit (blocked by blocker 2), suspend_d and stock_st (never
    reached, because stk_limit aborts the daily stage before them). Every claim
    about those three is code-reading, not measurement. name_history, daily and
    daily_basic HAVE now run -- 10 namechange year-units and 2/2 sessions each --
    so this is no longer the blanket "nothing downstream has ever run" state the
    predecessor handoff described.
  - >
    Whether the current-snapshot omission rate stays near 2 rows per session or
    rises on older dates. TWO sessions have now been collected (2024-01-02 and
    2018-01-02), which is not enough to establish a trend, and the 2018 unit's
    own witness-missing count has not been read off yet. The witness is a CURRENT
    snapshot classifying HISTORICAL sessions, so the rate can only worsen as the
    campaign reaches back; it is now telemetry and measurable per unit rather
    than fatal.
  - >
    Whether later namechange years carry a higher orphan rate than the measured
    0.09%. Years 2000-2018 are entirely unattempted, and delistings concentrate
    in some eras more than others, so the rate that matters for Sol's ruling is
    not yet known.
next_actions: >
  1. SOL: rule gate 1 above (pre-2016 namechange orphans). No canary window can
     reach terminal until it is ruled, so nothing downstream can start.
  2. Fix DSC:CNLI-STK-LIMIT-ZERO-PRE-CLOSE-SENTINEL, deciding the
     limits-published-with-zero-pre_close contradiction explicitly rather than by
     reflex. Needed regardless of how gate 1 is ruled.
  3. Resume bounded canary windows on 2018-01-02 (already retargeted; the 2024
     window is structurally unreachable per the stk_limit cap danger_area).
     Budget ~6 more windows for the remaining namechange years.
  4. Only then: the SEPARATE technical-readiness PR for the bulk gate, gated on a
     clean terminal canary AND independent review. Note that PR must now also
     treat the ticker-range campaign as REQUIRED for recent sessions, not as an
     optimisation.
  5. Then the resumable range campaign, then close DEP-EXACT on the sanitized
     completeness manifest.
do_not_redo:
  - >
    Do NOT relax the quarantined_unknown == 0 gate in _unit_done. The ruling
    makes these rows stop BEING quarantined; it does not make quarantine stop
    mattering.
  - >
    Do NOT widen the ruling to missing_in_pit (lifecycle-eligible but absent from
    the PIT witness). Sol ruled only on the current-snapshot direction. That case
    still blocks, deliberately.
  - >
    Do NOT put a threshold on the omission rate. It is telemetry. A threshold
    would reintroduce the survivorship filter as a tunable.
  - >
    Do NOT re-derive the epoch or re-run the census. Frozen at 1992-01-01,
    definition mainland-joint-complete-v1, merged at 19df24573e72.
  - >
    Do NOT build a historical CN-Limit identity master. Data OS/GMI stays the
    canonical identity owner; identity is rule-derived via canonical_identity.
  - >
    Do NOT promote BULK_HISTORICAL_BACKFILL_READY or dispatch mode=backfill in
    this PR. That promotion is a separate, reviewed change.
  - >
    Do NOT spawn a second blast-radius audit. Two attempts returned only an
    orienting sentence (25 then 53 tool calls, 259k tokens total, nothing
    delivered). The decisive question — which manifest conjunction terms break —
    was four greps in the main loop.
danger_areas:
  - >
    The filter reappears wherever a CURRENT reference artifact is used to
    classify a HISTORICAL observation. Three sites are fixed here; any new
    consumer that joins the PIT plane against the security master is a candidate
    fourth. The tell is a check whose failure mode is "the vendor no longer
    publishes it", not "the data disagrees".
  - >
    A landed PIT row is source-accounted but carries NO trading or identity
    authority. Anything that treats pit_universe membership as proof a security
    traded, or as an identity attestation, is wrong and reintroduces the defect
    from the other side.
  - >
    Backups of the private store hold superseded eras and must never be promoted:
    ~/.local/share/macro-dashboard/china_tushare_spine.prerebuild-20260826 is the
    OLD 1991-anchored trade_cal plane.
  - >
    `stage=complete` IS NOT ACCEPTANCE ON ITS OWN, and neither is
    `manifest["complete"]`. Two independent reasons, both measured in the source.
    First: `collect_name_history` BREAKS after NAMECHANGE_MAX_PER_RUN=5 attempts
    without raising, so it never blocks stage progression -- window 1 can spend
    pit(1) + name(5) + daily(5) = 11 of its 12 requests and report
    `stage=complete` with name_history at 5 of 35 years landed. Second:
    `manifest["complete"]` conjoins BULK_HISTORICAL_BACKFILL_READY FIRST, and
    that stays False by order, so the manifest can never report complete during
    the canary phase -- reading it as the acceptance signal would make a healthy
    canary look permanently failed. Acceptance must therefore be read from the
    UNITS: every expected unit terminal under `_unit_done`, including all 35
    namechange years (1990..end.year). A session that accepts on `stage=complete`
    alone will promote a one-seventh-finished canary.
  - >
    TWO witness-missing counters exist and they deliberately count DIFFERENT
    things. `witness_missing_row_count` on a collection-state unit is per-unit,
    i.e. per session. `pit_absent_from_master_count` in the reconciliation is an
    OBSERVATION count accumulated as (trade_date, ticker) pairs across the whole
    requested range, matching its siblings `lifecycle_missing_from_pit_count` and
    `pit_missing_from_lifecycle_count`. One security absent from the master on
    two sessions is therefore 1 in the first counter and 2 in the second, and
    both are correct. Do NOT "simplify" the reconciliation counter to distinct
    tickers: `current_snapshot_omission_rate` divides it by
    `union_observation_count`, which is an observation count, so distinct tickers
    over observations would not be a rate at all. This exact confusion produced
    the only failing assertion in the first full test run.
  - >
    CORRECTION to the previous handoff, which said the acceptance canary was ONE
    window of "pit 1 + name <=5 + daily 5 = <=11 against the cap of 12". The
    "<=5" was misread: NAMECHANGE_MAX_PER_RUN = 5 is a PER-RUN cap, not the
    total. collect_name_history iterates
    range(NAME_HISTORY_START_YEAR=1990, end.year + 1), which is 35 year-units for
    a 2024 window, and build_completeness_manifest requires every one of them
    (:4809 mirrors the same range). So stage=complete needs roughly 41 requests
    across about SEVEN windows, not one. This is not a blocker -- the units are
    resumable and the canary driver already loops windows -- but a session that
    budgets one window will conclude the canary is wedged when it is merely
    partway through name_history, which is exactly how a healthy resumable
    campaign gets misdiagnosed. Note also that NAME_HISTORY_START_YEAR (1990) is
    deliberately INDEPENDENT of the frozen 1992 calendar epoch: namechange units
    are announcement-year segments with no session-axis dependency, and
    normalise_name_history never touches _session_map, so 1990 and 1991 units are
    legitimate and must not be "corrected" to the epoch.
  - >
    MEASURED 2026-08-26, and it CORRECTS an estimate made earlier in this same
    session. SOURCE_ROW_CAPS['stk_limit'] is 5800 with a `>=` test. I sized the
    headroom against bak_basic's 5,344 A-shares for 2024-01-02 and predicted
    ~450 rows of slack. That was WRONG: stk_limit covers more instruments than
    the A-share PIT universe, and canary run 33026747482 died on exactly this
    cap. So the wall is not a forward risk for the campaign — it is already
    binding on a 2024 session, today.

    The refusal itself is correct and deliberate. `_activate_range_campaign`
    (:3343) refuses when `self.canary and not BULK_HISTORICAL_BACKFILL_READY`,
    with the comment that the scalable ticker-range path "is exactly what the
    bulk gate is still withholding, so a canary must never be the thing that
    first exercises it live". Note the resulting shape: the whole-market fast
    path cannot cover a recent session, the designed fallback is gated behind the
    bulk promotion, and the bulk promotion is gated behind a clean canary. A
    RECENT-DATE canary is therefore structurally unable to reach terminal, and no
    amount of re-running changes that.

    The error's advice, "Narrow the canary range and re-run", is misleading: the
    range was already ONE day, and the cap counts rows per session, not sessions
    per window. The actual lever is choosing an EARLIER session whose universe
    fits under the cap. This session retargeted the acceptance canary to
    2018-01-02 (universe ~3,500, and 29 namechange years instead of 35) for that
    reason. Do NOT respond by raising the constant: it is the vendor's documented
    per-call maximum, so raising it would bless a truncated response, which is
    the same fail-open the program already refused for trade_cal.

    Note also that daily and daily_basic (cap 6000) BOTH passed on 2024-01-02, so
    the true response size sits between 5,800 and 6,000 and only stk_limit's
    tighter constant caught it. Those two will hit their own wall a year or two
    later. The bulk-readiness PR must therefore treat the ticker-range campaign
    as REQUIRED for recent dates, not as an optimisation.

# Removing a survivorship filter that was written in three places

Sol's return-gate 10 ruling arrived as a semantic correction: the current
`stock_basic` snapshot is a witness, not authority on historical membership, so
historical PIT construction is source-union rather than current-snapshot
intersection. Recorded as `DEC:CNLI-HISTORICAL-PIT-IS-SOURCE-UNION`.

The instruction that turned out to matter most was "do not recreate the same
survivorship filter one stage later". It was literally descriptive. The filter
was encoded at the row classifier, at the PIT/lifecycle reconciliation, and at
the daily coverage expectation — and the latter two are both terms in the
completeness manifest's own `complete` conjunction, so each would have blocked
DEP-EXACT on its own while presenting as a fresh, unrelated defect.

One scoping judgment was taken inside the ruling rather than assumed silently:
`extra_in_pit` conflated a ticker absent from the master entirely (legal under
the ruling, now telemetry) with a ticker whose master lifecycle window
contradicts the observed trade date (an unresolved source contradiction, still
blocking). The same discipline applies to coverage — only the witness-missing
class stops counting as an unexplained gap.
