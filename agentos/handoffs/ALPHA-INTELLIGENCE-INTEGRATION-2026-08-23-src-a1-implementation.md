model: codex
ended_because: complete
mission: >
  Implement SRC-A1 as a bounded, source-only extension of the existing revisions
  collector: prospective raw EPS/revenue expectation observations and collection
  attempt receipts, with no model, product, scheduling, or authority expansion.
state_before: >
  K3E-0 and the SRC-A1 physical contract were accepted, but the revisions owner
  had no long-form prospective expectation artifact or receipted attempt lineage.
changed:
  - path: collectors/equity_revisions.py
    what: >
      Adds append-only, configurable-path SRC-A1 observation and attempt writers;
      records raw EPS/revenue horizons, typed absence, four distinct clock fields,
      deterministic identities, same-session replay idempotency, later-session
      receipts, correction lineage, and bounded provider failure taxonomy.
  - path: tests/test_equity_revisions_w2a.py
    what: >
      Hermetic source-contract proofs for all horizons and metrics, schema/order,
      idempotency, correction, typed absence, typed attempts, 401/403/429, safe
      diagnostics, fiscal rollover, backfill refusal, and legacy artifact parity.
verified:
  - claim: The source contract has focused hermetic behavioral proof.
    command: python3 -m pytest -q tests/test_equity_revisions_w2a.py
    result: 18 passed after the review-required clock, session, metric-boundary,
      crash-repair, calendar, and HTTP-token mutation cases were added.
  - claim: The collector remains syntactically valid and the patch has no whitespace errors.
    command: python3 -m py_compile collectors/equity_revisions.py && git diff --check
    result: passed.
  - claim: Agent OS records remain schema-valid.
    command: python3 scripts/agentos.py validate
    result: 0 errors; inherited repository warnings only.
unverified:
  - claim: A real scheduled provider collection has produced a lawful live receipt.
    what_would_verify: >
      A separately observed normal existing scheduler run after the exact accepted
      head is present; this PR deliberately changes no scheduler or cadence.
  - claim: This implementation PR has merged.
    what_would_verify: >
      The pull-request receipt, concluded exact-head CI, merge commit, remote-branch
      deletion, and origin/main ancestry check performed by the delivery session.
unresolved:
  - "yfinance does not expose provider-issued/source-effective clocks, fiscal mapping, or contributor identity; those fields remain typed null rather than inferred."
  - "No historical estimate history is created; SRC-A1 accrues only from lawful present-time collection onward."
next_actions:
  - "After exact-head CI and source-owner review accept this one PR, observe normal scheduled prospective accrual before treating the source capability as operational."
  - "Do not begin EXP-1, market coupling, vendor procurement, or any authority-bearing phase from this implementation wave."
do_not_redo:
  - "Do not create a K3E/Market-Belief/identity/residual/event/evaluation/ranker/publication store."
  - "Do not alter latest.parquet, history.parquet, engine/theme_revisions.py, the revisions universe, freshness window, cadence, or batch size."
  - "Do not fabricate source clocks, fiscal mappings, contributor identity, coverage, values, or historical rows."
danger_areas:
  - "A 429 is an attempt receipt, never neutral coverage or an observation value."
  - "A current snapshot written with a historical system clock would falsify point-in-time history; the writer rejects it."
  - "Merged source code is not a natural collection or production proof."

  - "DEC:SRC-A1-PROSPECTIVE-EXPECTATION-SOURCE-CONTRACT"

# SRC-A1 implementation return point

The next reader should use the accepted source contract first, then this
implementation receipt.  The only immediate delivery task is to reconcile the
exact implementation PR against current `origin/main`, wait for concluded binding
checks, and verify its merge.  A merge changes the source capability to
`BUILT_NOT_PROVEN`; only a lawfully observed scheduled collection can prove that
prospective accrual is operating in its real lane.
