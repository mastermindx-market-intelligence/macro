ended_because: complete
mission: >
  Implement Macro issue #6374 as the first bounded licensed-snapshot vertical:
  admit the Chairman-authorized W4 workbook plus four CSVs, preserve a private
  R2 corpus, derive a safe pointer-bound Historical Event History projection,
  expose it through the existing entitled BioCatalyst page, and stop at an
  exact-head HOLD-FOR-SOL PR without merge, publication, deployment, or
  production-acceptance claims.
state_before: >
  RECON-0 was merged architecture only. SNAPSHOT-ONBOARD was uncommissioned in
  the durable record, no licensed snapshot had been admitted, no historical
  projection/API/panel existed, and the W1–W4 archaeology language predated the
  Chairman's clarification that W4 is the canonical nine-sheet export and W1 is
  unnecessary.
changed:
  - path: engine/biocatalyst/jv_snapshot.py
    what: Exact-byte W4 plus four-CSV admission, deterministic normalization, Historical FDA left-shift repair, identity reconciliation, safe redaction, deduplication, and coverage accounting.

  - "A controlled local site_full override is browser proof of the exact build, not production entitlement or deployment proof."
  - "The source denominator includes 12 future Device Pipeline rows excluded from Historical Event History; silently dropping them would falsify coverage."
  - "The 24 source-URL tokens are deterministically redacted; restoring them would violate the public projection boundary."

## Current state

SNAPSHOT-ONBOARD A is implemented from the Chairman-authorized W4 workbook and
four CSVs. The exact deterministic generation contains 16,384 safe historical
events and is exercised by focused tests and a realistic real-Chromium matrix.
The live source registry, CT.gov canary, soak controls, production storage, and
deployment are untouched. The delivery is `BUILT_NOT_PRODUCTION_PROVEN` and is
held for Sol at the PR's exact head. There is no authority for
CONTINUOUS-RECON or another BioCatalyst source/cohort/cadence wave.
