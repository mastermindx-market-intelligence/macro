ended_because: complete
mission: >
  Under Sol's fresh action-time authorization, execute the remaining authenticated
  A1A production matrix against the sealed 13-row canonical Portfolio fixture,
  clean every controlled temporary row, restore the fixture sequentially under the
  semantic-v2 timestamp exception, and return a privacy-safe complete receipt to Sol
  without executing Scene 9, starting A1B, or marking A1A done.
state_before: >
  PD1 and the one-row semantic-v2 restoration probe were accepted evidence. The
  designated authenticated test account held the sealed canonical fixture: 13 rows,
  13 open and zero closed, one duplicate group with one extra row, exact authenticated
  ownership, Macro cloud/ready with no warning or fallback, exact Macro-Terminal
  semantic and ordered-id agreement, and four Watchlists with 134 memberships under
  both product-specific seals. Sol authorized exactly the sequential canonical
  evacuation, controlled A1A states, exact temporary cleanup, and sequential v2
  restoration. Scene 9 and A1B remained prohibited.

  - path: "Authenticated production Portfolio state"
    what: >
      Deleted the 13 sealed canonical rows sequentially by exact row id plus
      authenticated owner, executed the commissioned zero/one/unsized/mixed/failure
      states using four controlled temporary rows, deleted those four rows exactly,
      and restored the 13 canonical rows sequentially in the sealed ordered-id
      sequence while omitting created_at and updated_at. The account finished with
      the original semantic-v2 fixture and no temporary residue.

      source and independently recount the authoritative owner population after each call
    result: >
      PASS: every delete returned exactly one full row with exact id, owner, fields,
      and field set. The population decremented 13 to 12 to 11 to 10 to 9 to 8 to 7
      to 6 to 5 to 4 to 3 to 2 to 1 to 0 with no zero-row, duplicate, partial,

  - claim: "True zero remained distinct from the populated Watchlists"
    command: >
      Fresh Macro cloud list plus PF/rendered DOM inspection and Terminal no-store
      /api/portfolio; compare the empty Portfolio semantic/order seal and independently
      re-read all Watchlists and memberships
    result: >
      PASS: Macro and Terminal each returned a true Portfolio count of zero with the
      common empty seal 4f53cda18c2baa0c0354bb5f9a3ecbe5ed12ab4d8e11ba873c2f11161202b945.
      Macro displayed zero count, zero rows, empty table/book/risk state, and no
      Watchlist-only ticker in Portfolio count, table, book strip, seam, or risk.
      All four Watchlists and 134 memberships remained exact.
  - claim: "The controlled one-position state was honest and cross-product conformant"

      Exact explicit-id owner-scoped insert with one-row receipt; Macro cloud/rendered
      read and Terminal no-store /api/portfolio; inspect relationship/risk surfaces and
      re-read the full Watchlist baselines
    result: >
      PASS: population moved zero to one, both products returned the same canonical
      controlled row, Macro count and table each showed one, no relationship/cluster
      claim was fabricated, no degraded banner appeared, and Watchlists stayed exact.
      The shared state seal was b9f97801b615100f0bb240bc9c0d31de50870f1af60264cd6ca4f78b0c249f72.
  - claim: "Three all-unsized positions used only the explicit equal-weight analytical assumption"
    command: >
      Two additional exact owner-scoped inserts; Macro PS.computeWeighting derived-state
      inspection, rendered table/book disclosure, FX currentWeights provenance, and
      Terminal no-store /api/portfolio conformance read
    result: >
      PASS: all three rows retained null shares, no position value was invented, the
      private weighting state was all_unsized_equal with basis equal_assumption and a
      complete three-name equal distribution, the rendered page explicitly said equal
      weights were assumed because no sizes were entered, and FX carried three equal
      assumption weights. Terminal returned the same three canonical rows; Watchlists
      remained four lists and 134 memberships.
  - claim: "Mixed sizing abstained without silent completion or Watchlist fallback"
    command: >
      Exact fourth controlled insert carrying a size; Macro PS derived-state, rendered
      Book Read/seam, and FX currentWeights inspection; Terminal no-store conformance
      read; independent Watchlist reread
    result: >
      PASS: the four-row book contained one sized and three unsized positions,
      weighting state was mixed_unsized_abstain with basis none, complete false,
      reason mixed_sizing, and zero weights. The rendered page displayed the explicit
      mixed-sizing abstention, drew no distribution seam, and FX remained honest-empty
      auto/Portfolio scope rather than falling back to a Watchlist universe. Macro and
      Terminal agreed on shared seal d8d5b985c6a18d452a1a34f11ee8a082d566292911b9bf62bee1a592d260c366.
  - claim: "Healthy cloud read followed by failure preserved last-good rows degraded and read-only"
    command: >
      Seal the healthy four-row cloud read; CDP Network.setBlockedURLs scoped only to
      the portfolio_positions REST path; refresh Macro through the public auth/render
      seam; inspect authority/read state, warning, table, banner, save chip, FX
      provenance, console/resource privacy, Terminal canonical rows, and Watchlists;
      then clear the block and re-read healthy cloud state
    result: >
      PASS: Macro remained cloud authority and returned the exact healthy four-row seal
      as degraded last-good, warning cloud-unavailable, with all four rows visible,
      an explicit last-saved/read-only banner, a Portfolio-unavailable read-only chip,
      and no false zero, local substitution, stale risk, or private log/resource leak.
      Terminal independently remained healthy on the same canonical four rows and
      Watchlists stayed exact. Clearing the block returned Macro to cloud/ready with
      the identical four-row seal.
  - claim: "A first authenticated Portfolio read failure with no last-good terminated as explicit unknown"
    command: >
      Load the live production watchlist HTML and scripts into a fresh same-origin
      authenticated srcdoc document after the portfolio_positions endpoint block was
      armed; inspect the fresh WatchStore/PF/WS state, DOM, FX provenance, authenticated
      owner, console/resources, Watchlists, and independent healthy Terminal read
    result: >
      PASS: the fresh production document had no last-good cache and returned null,
      cloud/error, warning cloud-unavailable, PF count null, mode count em dash, an
      explicit locale-correct Portfolio-unavailable terminal message, zero table rows,
      hidden add control, and honest-empty Portfolio risk. It did not assert zero,
      remain loading, substitute anonymous/local/prior-user/Watchlist rows, or leak
      private identifiers. Terminal remained healthy on the four canonical controlled
      rows, which was non-contradictory because Macro made no population claim.
  - claim: "Privacy inspection passed across normal, zero, unsized, mixed, degraded, and first-read-failure states"
    command: >
      For each commissioned state scan visible text for private row identifiers, owner
      ids, and notes; inspect browser console records; inspect resource URLs for private
      tokens reaching analytics or any unexpected origin; verify authority and risk
      provenance; scan the durable receipt for fixture values and authentication material
    result: >
      PASS: no private fixture value, owner identifier, row identifier, note, or
      authentication material entered console output, analytics, an unexpected resource
      destination, or this durable receipt. Authenticated failure never crossed into
      anonymous local authority, and Watchlist membership never entered Portfolio
      population, weights, book, or risk.
  - claim: "Every controlled temporary row was permanently removed before restoration"
    command: >
      Four separate owner-and-id-scoped delete-select-star calls; compare each returned
      full row with its exact create receipt; prove direct id absence and populations
      4 to 3 to 2 to 1 to 0; re-read Terminal and Watchlists at zero
    result: >
      PASS: every delete returned exactly one full matching row and each id became
      durably absent. The create and delete aggregate receipt seals were identical at
      5f41ef7af2d3f374fce3273a19da3ae5dbcc5cd54537f95d962df978afbfda7b.
      Macro and Terminal both returned zero before restoration and Watchlists remained
      exact; no temporary row was present when canonical restoration began.
  - claim: "The canonical fixture restored sequentially under semantic-v2 with exact order prefixes"
    command: >
      Thirteen separate authenticated owner-scoped inserts in the sealed authoritative
      ordered-id sequence; for each build input from the sealed row while omitting only
      created_at and updated_at, require one returned row, compare every supplied
      semantic field and full field set, verify regenerated timestamps, recount the
      population, and compare the authoritative ordered-id prefix
    result: >
      PASS: all 13 inserts returned exactly one row with exact id, owner, ticker,
      shares, entry price, entry date, notes, status, closed_at/null-state fields, and
      field set. Every population increment zero through 13 and every ordered-id prefix
      was exact. created_at and updated_at were present and changed for every row as
      expected. The aggregate restored semantic receipt seal is

  - claim: "Immediate post-restoration proof reproduced every accepted baseline"
    command: >
      Fresh ordered Macro Supabase read plus WatchStore/render state; Terminal no-store
      /api/portfolio and /api/watchlist; exact comparison with the sealed semantic-v2
      fixture, owner, order, duplicate multiset, temp-id set, and Watchlist baselines;
      console/resource privacy scan
    result: >
      PASS: 13 rows, 13 open and zero closed, exact owner and all semantic fields,
      only the two regenerated timestamps different, no temporary ids, one duplicate

  - claim: "The delayed reconciliation-window proof independently reproduced the same state"
    command: >
      Wait 15 seconds, then repeat fresh authenticated Macro ordered Portfolio and
      Watchlist reads, rendered authority state, Terminal no-store Portfolio and
      Watchlist reads, temp absence, semantic/order/duplicate comparison, and privacy scan
    result: >
      PASS after 15,000 ms: every count, open/closed split, owner, semantic-v2 seal,
      shared seal, ordered-id seal, duplicate seal, product-specific Watchlist seal,
      Macro cloud/ready state, Terminal conformance, temporary absence, and privacy
      assertion was identical to the immediate receipt.
  - claim: "The harness and authority boundary finished clean"
    command: >
      Clear Network.setBlockedURLs and disable Network debugging; remove the fresh
      failure document; restore any temporary console observer; inspect final Macro
      authority/read state and compare the action log with Sol's authorization
    result: >
      PASS: no endpoint block, injected frame, or console observer remained. Macro
      finished cloud/ready with no warning and Portfolio count 13. Scene 9 was not
      executed, authentication was not transitioned, A1B was not started, no Watchlist
      write occurred, and no Terminal/Macro code or schema was changed.
  - claim: "Verifier-only harness misses were bounded and non-destructive"
    command: >
      Inspect each failed verifier before retry: CDP evaluation deadline, authenticated
      DOM row-action identifier classification, Macro/Terminal field casing and blank/null
      normalization, rendered text casing/locale, and unsupported navigation-time CDP paths
    result: >
      Every miss was read-only or stopped before a database request. No blind mutation
      retry occurred. The only cross-product normalization required after restoration
      was one empty-string note represented by Terminal as null; its semantic characters
      were equal, all other fields matched raw, and the accepted shared canonicalizer
      reproduced the sealed result.

      --check; targeted receipt scan for account identifiers, controlled tickers,
      bearer/JWT material, and other private fixture markers
    result: >
      Agent OS validated the full current record set with zero errors; the compiled context bundle
      parsed as valid JSON; the records diff had no whitespace errors; and the
      privacy scan found no account identifier, controlled ticker, bearer/JWT token,
      or private fixture value. The 29 validation warnings were pre-existing advisory
      cross-workstream phantom-path, lifecycle, and review-date findings outside A1A.

  - "Authenticated failure has two distinct valid terminal states: degraded last-good rows or error/null with no last-good. Neither is an empty Portfolio."
  - "The first-read failure proof depends on a genuinely fresh JavaScript document; a normal reload of a tab with last-good state proves the degraded branch instead."
  - "Only created_at and updated_at are excluded by semantic-v2. The ordered-id seal remains a separate hard invariant after timestamp regeneration."

# A1A final authenticated production matrix

Verdict: **PASS / CLEANUP EXACT / RETURN TO SOL FOR FINAL RULING.**

Every commissioned authenticated state passed in production. The original canonical
Portfolio fixture is restored exactly under semantic-v2, all controlled temporary rows
are durably absent, Macro and Terminal agree, and both product-specific Watchlist
baselines are unchanged immediately and after the reconciliation window.

This is the complete production acceptance packet for Sol. It deliberately does not
advance A1A to `done`, execute Scene 9, or start A1B.
