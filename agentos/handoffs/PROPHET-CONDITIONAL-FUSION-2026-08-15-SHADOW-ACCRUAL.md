model: fable
ended_because: complete
prs: ["#5769"]
mission: >
  Close the second half of the reader gap the override's own handoff flagged in its
  danger_areas: the two US consumers still reading the five v2 legs off `prophet` after
  #5753 moved them to `prophet_shadow`. Decide — as a design call for the workstream —
  whether to leave the store's ten `prophet_*` leg columns null on a fusion board or to
  accrue the retired scorer under its own name, then ship the US-side test that would
  have caught it.
state_before: >
  #5753 merged. `component_coverage` had been repointed onto the shadow in that PR (the
  "first casualty" its handoff names), but `engine/us_context_vector.py` and
  `engine/us_candidate_lanes.py` had not. Result, measured rather than inferred: from
  the first fusion night all ten `prophet_{leg}` / `_{leg}_points` columns in
  data/us_prophet_rank/candidates read null on every US row, and the candidate-pool row
  published `components: {}` / `points: {}`. Silent — `_finite(None)` returns None so
  nothing raised, and no US test pinned the columns (every `prophet_signal` assertion in
  tests/ is China-side).
changed:
  - path: engine/us_context_vector.py
    what: "NEW `SHADOW_COLUMNS` family (13 columns): prophet_shadow_definition,
      prophet_shadow_score, prophet_shadow_score_rank, and prophet_shadow_{leg} /
      _{leg}_points for the five SCORE_COMPONENTS. Read off the board row's
      `prophet_shadow` block, stamped on EVERY record present-or-null, same law as
      POOL_COLUMNS/HUB_COLUMNS. The canonical `prophet_*` columns are UNCHANGED and stay
      null on a v3 row by design. prophet_shadow_definition registered in
      _OBJECT_COLUMNS (text column, null on every off-board row and every degraded
      night)."
  - path: engine/us_candidate_lanes.py
    what: "_pool_row carries a sibling `prophet_shadow` block (version, score,
      score_rank, components, points), display/forward-grading only, null when the board
      row has no shadow. The existing `prophet` block's keys and types are untouched;
      its comment, which claimed the canonical block carries the legs, was corrected."
  - path: tests/test_us_context_vector.py
    what: "NEW TestTheRetiredScorerAccruesUnderItsOwnName (6 tests) — builds a real v3
      board through us_board_rank.score_rows and reads the definition back with
      published_definition(). Pins: canonical legs null on a fusion row; shadow legs
      read off the shadow block; a genuinely measured 0.0 surviving as 0.0 while an
      off-board row stays null; a degraded night publishing the legs and carrying no
      shadow; the whole family on every row. Imports the fusion suite's `_row` helper
      rather than mirroring it."
  - path: tests/test_us_candidate_lanes.py
    what: "NEW TestTheRetiredScorerRidesAlongWithNoAuthority (3 tests) — shadow block

    carries them as open, and a reader arriving through that chain would otherwise
    re-open settled questions."

    MERGES. research/prophet_fusion/W3_SHADOW_RACE_RECUT.md (#5767, merged while this
    PR's packs ran) puts the champion side as 'stamped nightly by production' and names
    `prophet_shadow.score`/`score_rank`. Those live on the BOARD ROW. The race frame is
    the candidates store (scripts/prophet_fusion_race.py:88), and until #5769 the store
    had no shadow column at all — the numbers were computed nightly and dropped. So:
    read `prophet_shadow_score` / `prophet_shadow_score_rank` (store names, this PR),
    not `prophet_score`/`score_rank` (the CHALLENGER's on a v3 row —
    DSC:CHAMPION-BASELINE-COLUMNS-CARRY-THE-CHALLENGER). And the store forbids
    retroactive backfill, so the champion side is NULL for every night between the
    override (2026-08-15) and #5769's first nightly. W3's champion window opens then,
    not at the override date. Neither #5767 nor #5753 knows this."
  - "(inherited) Verify the first post-merge nightly publishes rank_by=us_prophet_v3
    with a fusion receipt and no degradation stamp"
  - "(inherited) C2 re-enters when the fold law is satisfiable: 91 graded dates needed,
    67 more than held. Unchanged by this PR."
  - "(inherited) First us_prophet_v3 H=10 grade matures ~10 sessions after the first
    fusion night"
do_not_redo:
  - "Do not fill the canonical `prophet_*` leg columns from `prophet_shadow` on a v3
    row. It is misattribution and the store is append-only, so shadow-fed v3 rows would
    pool with genuine v2 rows forever. The nulls are the decision, not the bug —
    DEC:US-SHADOW-ACCRUES-UNDER-ITS-OWN-COLUMN-FAMILY, pinned by
    test_the_canonical_legs_stay_null_on_a_fusion_row."
  - "Do not write 0.0 for an absent shadow leg. A leg that genuinely measured 0.0 and a
    leg that was never computed are different facts and the store is the permanent
    record of which happened."
  - "Do not stamp prophet_shadow_* on a degraded night. There the retired scorer IS the
    published ranker, so the same number under two names would hand a forward race a
    guaranteed tie and let it score that as an observation."
  - "Do not read an arena champion baseline off prophet_score / score_rank without
    stratifying on board_definition — see the DSC."
  - "Do not believe a red from these suites in a sparse worktree. 17 of them here were
    artifacts of the omitted site/ and data/ trees; materialize before diagnosing."

    lists remain binding — see PROPHET-CONDITIONAL-FUSION-2026-08-15-OVERRIDE.md"
danger_areas:
  - "The store is APPEND-ONLY and forward-only. A column added here is null for every
    prior night and permanent for every night after, so a naming or semantics mistake
    cannot be edited out later — it can only be superseded by a second column."
  - "`prophet_shadow` is absent by design on a degraded night AND on every sibling board
    (hk_prophet_v1 never had one). Code that treats its absence as an error rather than
    as a reading will fire on exactly the nights something else already went wrong."
  - "The thirteen columns are read off the board row and originate nothing. If
    score_rows ever stops freezing `prophet_shadow.score_rank` onto the row before the
    canonical sort, prophet_shadow_score_rank goes null store-wide with nothing raising
    — the same silent shape this PR exists to close."
  - "(inherited) score_rows is SHARED with hk_board_rank; every fusion path is gated on
    definition == BOARD_DEFINITION and widening that gate silently re-ranks HK."
---

Cold-stranger summary: #5753 retired the five-leg `us_prophet_v2` scorer into a
zero-authority shadow and kept it running so the forward race would have a champion side
from night one. Its own handoff warned, in `danger_areas`, that anything still reading
`prophet.components` on a US row now reads a block that no longer exists — and named
`component_coverage` as "the first casualty". It was not the last: the PIT context store
and the candidate-pool row were the other two readers, and because they ACCRUE rather
than display, their failure was silent by construction and permanent by storage. Ten
store columns went null on the first fusion night while the values sat one field away.

The call taken here is to keep those ten null — the C1 ranker genuinely has no five-leg
decomposition, and filling them from the shadow would stamp the retired heuristic's
arithmetic under the canonical ranker's name in an append-only store — and to accrue the
retired scorer under its own thirteen-column family instead. The composite and the rank
ride with the legs, and that is the part worth carrying forward: the override's handoff
already described the forward race as "a join of the SAME ticker-level graded outcomes
against two rank columns", and the store carried one. The second was being computed
nightly and dropped.

The finding a w3 session most needs is not the nulls but what sits beside them:
`families.yml` declares `prophet_score`, `score_rank`, `display_rank` and `featured` as
the champion's own output, and on a fusion night all four carry the challenger's numbers
— measured, 81.7 against the champion's 62.5, on a row the champion ranked 3rd. A null
announces itself; a column that quietly changed meaning does not. The registry is not
edited here because it is a sibling's law, so a w3 re-cut must read the champion side
off `prophet_shadow_*` and stratify on `board_definition`, never off the bare column
names.

*Supersedes `PROPHET-CONDITIONAL-FUSION-2026-08-15-OVERRIDE.md` as the latest record for
this workstream without altering it; that file remains the fuller account of the override
itself — its byte-parity proofs, the as-of-night floor derivation, and the family
separation limits — and its still-live items are carried forward above.*

## PR-3A reconciliation (2026-08-16)

The YAML `unresolved` block above is this session's record. PR-3A recut
`families.yml` so baseline roles are definition-aware
(`DSC:CHAMPION-BASELINE-COLUMNS-CARRY-THE-CHALLENGER`): there is no timeless
`champion_baseline.columns` list. Canonical v3 output is
`published_ranker_output`; the retired v2 scorer is `retired_shadow_output`
under `prophet_shadow_*`. Do not treat the 2026-08-15 champion_baseline drift as
still live registry law.
