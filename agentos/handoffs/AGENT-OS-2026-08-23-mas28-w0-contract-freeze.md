mission: >
  Reconcile the controlling Chairman MAS-28 commission with current protected
  Skillpack, repository, Agent OS, Linear, template, native-link and adjacent-carrier
  state; freeze an implementation-complete records-only V1 contract before any core
  validator or authoring-surface changes.
state_before: >
  MAS-28 had an autonomous commission but no canonical repository freeze. Its older
  issue body, open Macro #6135 and Mastermind template used the old enum family;
  MAS-6 exposed untracked_refused as author input; Terminal had no template; MAS-67
  proved relation-only and skip/ignore but not closing/non-closing or full admin
  readback. No deterministic MAS-28 core or shadow integration existed.
changed:
  - path: research/MASTERMIND_PR_LINKAGE_VALIDATOR_V1_ARCHITECTURE_FREEZE_2026-08-23.md
    what: >
      Freezes exact author grammar/compatibility epoch, header parser, observation and
      report schemas, class/verdict axes, finding taxonomy, native-link/hash/exit law,
      calibration/cutover sequence and no-rebuild boundaries.
  - path: agentos/decisions/DEC-MAS28-PR-LINKAGE-VALIDATOR-V1-REPORT-ONLY.md
    what: >
      Records the durable canonical-grammar and report-only authority choice, including
      the barrier against branch protection, merge gating and mutation.
  - path: agentos/discoveries/DSC-MAS28-AUTHORING-GRAMMAR-DRIFT.md
    what: >
      Records the exact cross-repository template/issue drift and its receipt-based
      falsifier so future sessions repair rather than rediscover it.
  - path: agentos/handoffs/AGENT-OS-2026-08-23-mas28-w0-contract-freeze.md
    what: >
      Provides this cold-session wave boundary, pins, exclusions and exact continuation.
  - path: agentos/workstreams/WS-AGENT-OS.md
    what: >
      Adds the bounded MAS28-W0 continuation without altering the pre-existing Agent OS
      W0-W4 program or falsely starting its separate W4 hook wave.
verified:
  - claim: The protected Sol Skillpack was loaded atomically from current protected Mastermind master.

      0a009d5314a4a3bbb1aac2f111b68644fc7a64d8; schema mastermind.sol_skillpack.v1,
      version 1.0.0 and bootstrap major 1 are compatible.
  - claim: W0 is pinned to fresh current repository heads and no intervening relevant authority movement was ignored.
    command: >
      git fetch all three origins; fast-forward the isolated Macro carrier with
      git merge --ff-only origin/main; inspect targeted logs/diffs and current templates.
    result: >
      Macro pin 9b3153fd9476c42020bbd0b427ebf7edf72eabb8; Mastermind pin
      db0bac5fe3f72348262d42c8bd26b836bda9f61d; Terminal pin
      449439c690e93ba968185499af4041c2f512b659. Post-commission Macro movement also
      included #6258's dislocation CI manifest/workflow expansion; exact diff review proved
      it did not change ci-gate, contract-delta, House-Law census or MAS-28 placement law.
      Nine later commits through 9b3153fd9476c42020bbd0b427ebf7edf72eabb8 were exact-path
      reconciled and touched only unrelated data, research/runbook, cycle-pattern,
      issuer-profile, press-wire, Asia dashboard render and timing-receipt surfaces.
  - claim: The controlling commission, MAS-6, MAS-28, MAS-67, #6119, #6135, templates and adjacent MAS-65/MAS-66 were reconciled.
    command: >
      Read the current Linear commission/issue/document/comments and current GitHub PR
      metadata/diffs/checks plus protected default-branch repository bytes.
    result: >
      The Chairman commission is newest and canonical; #6135 remains the sole Macro
      template carrier; MAS-65/#6182 and MAS-66 remain separate; MAS-67 C/D are proven
      while A/B/admin readback remain partial and nonblocking for the pure core.
  - claim: W0 contains records only and creates no execution/control-plane behavior.
    command: >
      git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD and python3 scripts/agentos.py validate
      immediately before W0 delivery.
    result: >
      Expected paths are one research law, one decision, one discovery, one handoff and
      one workstream metadata update; validator/config/template/workflow/runtime paths are absent.
unverified:
  - claim: Canonical templates are live in all three repositories.
    what_would_verify: >
      W0B exact merge/blob receipts and a real new-draft prepopulation proof in Macro,
      Mastermind and Terminal.
  - claim: The deterministic validator is built and adversarially accepted.
    what_would_verify: >
      W1 one-carrier implementation, hostile/property/mutation/no-network proof and an
      independent review/repair return against this exact freeze.
  - claim: Native closing/non-closing semantics and admin configuration are proven.
    what_would_verify: >
      Lawful MAS-67 A/B canaries, multi-PR receipt when available and three-repository
      administrator readback; until then affected rules remain partial/warning-only.
  - claim: The report-only path is proven on a real current PR.
    what_would_verify: >
      W2 blinded calibration acceptance followed by W3 immutable real-PR observation,
      artifact/annotation/summary receipts with always-nonblocking behavior.
unresolved:
  - "Macro #6135 is stale and must be reconciled in place after W0; its historical checks are not exact-head proof and its carrier must also repair the selectable design-migration template."
  - "Mastermind template filenames collide by case; actual GitHub draft-prepopulation behavior requires real proof."
  - "MAS-67 remaining admin/operator actions are external and do not block W1/W2."
  - "scripts/** enters existing Macro CI-authority inventory; accept that honest review path without registering linkage findings as House Law."
next_actions:
  - "After this W0 records carrier merges, reconcile Macro #6135 in place to the canonical grammar and cutover law; do not open a duplicate Macro template PR."
  - "In disjoint carriers, correct Mastermind's authoring surface while preserving Executive wording and add Terminal's missing repository-local template, then capture exact merge/blob/draft-prepopulation receipts."
  - "Start W1 only from merged W0: one Macro principal carrier implementing scripts/pr_linkage_validator.py, frozen config, pure modules, fixtures and hostile/property/mutation/no-network tests; no CI enforcement."
do_not_redo:
  - "Do not reopen the grammar decision or treat the older MAS-28 issue/template literals as canonical."
  - "Do not create a duplicate #6135, second Agent OS/task store, lifecycle database, webhook, projector, native client, merge controller or branch-protection rule."
  - "Do not absorb MAS-65/MAS-66 or represent unproven MAS-67 A/B/admin behavior as proven."
  - "Do not infer semantic completion from merge, green CI, a branch issue ID or a Linear Done projection."
danger_areas:
  - "Unknown or unavailable snapshots must become typed partial state, never guessed clean."
  - "Header parsing is zone/state-machine based; examples/comments/fences/quotes/later prose have no authority."
  - "Semantic hash excludes PR/SHA/run/time/host/human wording but receipts retain exact grounding."
  - "REFUSE_METADATA is advisory in V1 and exits zero for a valid observation."

# Cold-session return point

Read the protected Skillpack, this freeze, `DEC:MAS28-PR-LINKAGE-VALIDATOR-V1-REPORT-ONLY`,
`DSC:MAS28-AUTHORING-GRAMMAR-DRIFT`, #6119 law, current MAS-6/MAS-28/MAS-67 and exact current
default branches. W0 authoring is the authority boundary; W0B/W1 may implement it but may not
silently amend it.
