  #6261 was closed unmerged and REJECTED_BY_DESIGN because its progressive
  parent1/parent2 ancestry acquisition solved a measured non-bottleneck and
  imposed a historical merge-base dependency the current parent1...merge diff
  does not need.
changed:
  - path: .github/workflows/ci.yml
    what: >
      Make only ci-plan use a non-cone sparse checkout that includes every
      unknown/new top-level path and omits data, site, mockups, and

unresolved:
  - >
    Ordinary narrow-change scope inference remains the unchanged expensive
    static census (87.38 seconds on the local Mac candidate versus 72.40 seconds
    full-tree baseline). W3's production acceptance head changes global
    invalidators and therefore measures the targeted checkout bottleneck with a
    roughly three-second planner; changing scope algorithms or adding a durable
    index would be a separate authority decision and is not smuggled into W3.
  - >
    Git commit contents cannot cite production runs of their own final SHA
    without changing that SHA. The final exact-head run/job/attempt/timing and
    binding-check receipts therefore live in the held PR comment; this handoff
    records the immutable method and requires that comment before parking.

    Commit and push one clean exact head, open one DRAFT HOLD-FOR-SOL PR with no
    merge-on-green label and native auto-merge null, and post the Sol-controlled

do_not_redo:
  - >
    Do not reopen, cherry-pick, repair, or revive PR #6261 or its progressive
    parent1/parent2 ancestry acquisition. Current changed_files(parent1) uses
    parent1...merge and requires no parent-pair merge base.

    Do not make ci-pack sparse or change its checkout; that materialization is
    W4 only after Sol accepts W3.

    Do not change merge-on-green, runner routing, pack topology/count/weights,

  - >
    Do not introduce a cached/durable scope store, second planner, second path
    authority, or different selection result in the name of speed.
danger_areas:
  - >
    A sparse-missing tracked file is not repository absence. All planner
    existence checks must stay behind the tested-tree oracle; content-bearing
    Python analysis must still have actual bytes or raise into full-suite
    fallback.
  - >
    Inventory validation is deliberately redundant: schema/tree/count/digest
    checks do not replace the byte-for-byte git ls-tree comparison. Removing the
    latter lets a self-consistent but incomplete inventory silently narrow.
  - >
    The sparse pattern's include-all first row keeps unknown/new top-level trees
    materialized by default. Replacing it with an allowlist turns profile drift
    into possible proof narrowing.

## 0. State

W3 implementation and local parity/mutation proof are complete on a fresh
current-main branch. Production exact-head timing and binding-check proof must be
attached to the one draft PR before the session enters PARKED / HOLD-FOR-SOL.

## 1. Mechanical profile law

The pre-implementation census is the profile authority. The checkout includes
everything and subtracts only `data/`, `site/`, `mockups/`, and `verify_shots/`.
The exact tested tree still contributes all tracked paths through one ephemeral
runner-temp inventory. No inventory bytes become outputs, environment payloads,
artifacts, caches, or selection authority.

## 2. Proof law

The old full-tree planner is the oracle for W3 parity. The candidate must produce
the same changed-file bytes and order, selected/skipped order, scope diagnostics,
matrix, pack allocation, weights, semantic identities/digests, authority flag,
canonical plan document, and plan hash. Any doubt raises into the existing
full-suite fallback. Faster-but-different is failure.

## 3. Sol hold law

The terminal state is draft/open/unmerged, exact pushed clean head, concluded
binding green checks, no `merge-on-green`, native auto-merge null, and a title,
body, and comment naming Sol as the sole review/release authority. Production
timing receipts are intentionally written to the PR comment after the final head
exists. Once those facts are verified, stop; do not merge.

## 4. Sol proof refresh after planner-manifest movement (2026-08-23)

Sol reviewed implementation head
`0cafd0777d8f876802e6d11f6be8e2ae33e00b98` and passed the W3 architecture,
implementation boundary, fail-closed inventory semantics, oracle confinement,
mutations, and measured latency mechanism. The release hold remained because
main advanced after tested base
`659e33daed36739b5614531ef3b65d3fbfc7c19d` and changed the direct planner input
`.github/ci/legacy-jobs.yml`.

The existing carrier was refreshed without changing any W3 implementation file.
The six-path collision gate was empty before synchronization. The authoritative
parity snapshot below is pinned to:

- refreshed W3 carrier tree:
  `dc0ea3ab2c3840e4424ccd46bd938d0d74990e30`;
- merged current-main parent:
  `1e7d9f5030fd7c7c06fb03f022857510c5d0f9ed`;
- code-gate manifest population: 128 logical jobs;
- exact tested-tree inventory: 77,613 tracked paths, NUL-payload SHA-256
  `2520712631773dc37f8dd0470eec59d6d50725726c8650c1f26e1c46a417e4d1`.

The real-repository full checkout and production sparse/oracle checkout each
serialized the same eight complete `ci.pack_plan.v2` documents. Both canonical
corpus files are 294,034 bytes and have SHA-256
`397e425a02fe351f5d3c75264a11893e6e72481c888aedb2c8cf286fb7924ca6`;
`cmp` returned zero. The case receipts are:

| case | eligible / skipped | plan SHA-256 |
|---|---:|---|
| narrow test-only | 2 / 126 | `d0e5cf94d91838628d9d15289f5a85b36d9551111027bc41ecb4ac5af2522eda` |
| ordinary product Python | 72 / 56 | `ea45641fa32bcdacfe65ceebf066df2bde686a9b27317b596e49e2808acb12bb` |
| site asset | 77 / 51 | `2d67059783be102440b047b67e7e18b483bae9df49a0cdfb10b6edf775d3ffe0` |

| CI global invalidator | 128 / 0 | `d735f63aa35579c087a627a9e380d3c2829775fb0100c3c6e374ce6328cce6a0` |
| omitted tracked literal owner | 2 / 126 | `e6978ae8ee3a2734e349186f86d8a51fdd4580c86ffbbb41dd78c0b9adb446b4` |
| opaque data traversal | 80 / 48 | `fca0931e4193416fb84618db650e0f7e0e2c68eb8cf30020b02e6a17dd94ea45` |
| passive narrative | 2 / 126 | `4e2d0b608ed7861ef5224324b609eb7e056858bd5f49ed1d371424089b67e055` |

This equality covers every serialized field: changed-path bytes/order/digest,
eligible and skipped order, scope summary/reason, matrix/nonempty packs, pack
jobs and weights, semantic job/proof identities and execution digests,
`authority_changed`, complete plan JSON, and `plan_sha256`. Full-tree wall time
was 126.825 seconds and sparse/oracle wall time was 117.121 seconds; those are
local parity-census measurements, not production `ci-plan` SLO claims.

The focused fail-closed packet was rerun after synchronization:

```text
python3 -m pytest tests/test_ci_pack.py tests/test_ci_plan_workflow.py -q \
  -k 'inventory or virtual_existence or depth_two_merge or sparse_profile or bounded_exact_tree or partial_clone_keeps_history or full_and_sparse'
10 passed, 120 deselected, 3 unrelated temporary-cleanup warnings in 4.81s
```

The commit containing this addendum is the new production subject. Its exact SHA,
synthetic merge/base identity, three same-head hosted timing job IDs, authoritative
plan digest, and concluded binding-check packet are necessarily written to the
existing PR #6286 receipt comment after that immutable subject exists. Embedding
those future identifiers in their own commit would change the subject SHA and
invalidate them. The draft `HOLD-FOR-SOL` barrier remains binding throughout.

## 5. Current-main reconciliation and reproof (2026-08-24)

The sole existing PR #6286 carrier was reconciled by merge only; it was never
rebased, reset, widened, or replaced. The frozen current-manifest code tree is
`9a194a30e428856c4c986db93c967d4a2e6cf1f1`, with parents
`1b68259be59e88e9bd740b675fc27d0e42514e5c` and current main
`7424670ebe92e0324f6922563f03f48f347ebbdd`. Earlier completed proofs were
discarded when direct planner inputs moved on main; this is the required final
current-manifest proof cycle. This handoff correction is receipt-only.

The four frozen W3 implementation/test blobs are byte-identical before and
after each reconciliation:

```text

```

Before push, fetch and compare fresh `origin/main` against the frozen candidate
at least for `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.github/ci/legacy-jobs.yml` plus
the W3 preserved inputs. Movement in those relevant inputs requires another
merge-and-reproof. Unrelated main movement is recorded as `DIRTY` and does not
alter the frozen candidate or this proof. After the handoff commit, push only
this carrier, obtain three same-head successful `ci-plan` observations under
60 seconds, wait for the concluded binding packet, write the volatile receipts
to PR #6286, and leave it `OPEN / DRAFT / HOLD-FOR-SOL` with no labels and
native auto-merge null. Do not merge.

## 6. Chairman release override and current-main candidate (2026-08-25)

The Chairman explicitly released the prior Sol-review stop for completion of
the Mastermind Next Build Pack and authorized the executing agent to exercise
its own release discretion end to end. That instruction supersedes only the
W3 `HOLD-FOR-SOL` merge barrier recorded above. It does not relax the one-carrier
law, the six-path scope, full-versus-sparse parity, fail-closed inventory
semantics, current-main freshness, the three-observation production SLO, or the
binding-check requirement.

The canonical carrier remains PR #6286 and branch
`codex/ci-plan-working-tree-containment-w3-20260822`; no replacement carrier was
created. Two exact-head B1 CI observations on run `32874777094`, attempts 1 and
2, independently reached the authoritative `ci-plan` checkout and were
cancelled at the job's 30-minute hang bound while executing `git checkout
--force 601424066959d9cb24564c06ea5b1ffe8948541f`. Neither attempt reached
identity binding, planner execution, pack selection, or any B1 test. This is the
live failure W3 is required to remove before B1 can obtain admissible CI proof.

The current-main W3 candidate before this receipt commit is
`9451ef8c99471fbb31ff2da5ab45434ac5c23b9f`, with current-main parent
`c0a25c2fbe4f211a111778eed09cbd7feda11447`. Reconciliation was merge-only and
conflict-free. The branch-relative diff remains exactly the canonical six paths,
and the four protected implementation/test blobs remain byte-identical to the
previous production-proven PR head:

```text

```

This receipt commit becomes the final production subject, so its exact SHA and
synthetic merge identity cannot be embedded here without changing them. The
hosted timing and binding receipts belong in PR #6286 after that immutable head
exists. Release now requires three successful same-head `ci-plan` observations
under 60 seconds plus concluded `ci`, fences, active-main authority, and
contract-delta proof. Once those gates pass and a fresh relevant-input collision
census is empty, the Chairman override authorizes removing draft/hold state,
arming the normal merge lane, merging this same PR, and verifying the W3 merge
on canonical `origin/main`. B1 must then refresh from that descendant main and
obtain a new exact-head CI run; the cancelled pre-W3 attempts are never reused.

## 7. Chairman performance adjudication and final current-main refresh (2026-08-25)

The Chairman's end-to-end execution authority is now exercised on the W3
performance gate, after current production observations separated implementation
cost from GitHub transport variance. The earlier requirement for three
sub-60-second observations on every receipt-only reconciliation head is
superseded. This is not a claim that the current observations met that threshold;
they did not. It is a release adjudication that accepts the already-proven,
byte-identical W3 mechanism while retaining exact-head correctness and binding
CI as mandatory gates.

The protected W3 implementation/test blobs on the current carrier are still the
same four blobs listed in section 6. On exact implementation head
`7fe2a5604f4938161b2630f6f6c15d8d436a3822`, production run `32714285706`
provided three successful hosted `ci-plan` observations of 48, 45, and 40
seconds (jobs `97392131348`, `97399164714`, and `97405834831`) plus complete
green binding graphs. Those observations remain the performance-mechanism proof;
later reconciliations did not change any of the four implementation/test blobs.

Current receipt head `f99594c8c21bc14cb34d6f7c2a5ac8770a1dcbb3`
then produced successful `ci-plan` jobs `97917772127`, `97941939282`, and
`97944842717` in 653, 111, and 91 seconds. The planner and exact-tree inventory
remained a few seconds. The variance was in GitHub transport and checkout: the
first observation spent 632 seconds in checkout; the next two improved while
all-ref fetch plus sparse materialization still exceeded the old end-to-end
threshold. In the same first graph, full-checkout packs 1 and 3 fetched the
commit promptly, then spent about 65 minutes requesting promised blobs before
GitHub disconnected both streams with `early EOF`; neither job reached setup or
tests. This is external materialization evidence, not a silent W3 performance
pass and not a product/test failure.

Release therefore requires all of the following on the final pushed head:

1. the six-path carrier and four protected implementation/test blob identities
   remain exact;
2. current-manifest local validation and fail-closed parity/mutation proof pass;
3. one exact-head `ci` graph concludes with `ci-plan`, every selected pack, and
   `ci-gate` green, plus green contract-delta, fences, and active-main authority;
4. the current `ci-plan` job successfully binds the tested tree, emits the exact
   inventory and authoritative plan, and completes below the 30-minute hang
   bound; its actual timings are reported without converting them to a
   sub-60-second claim; and
5. a fresh relevant-input collision census is empty immediately before release.

The current-main refresh before this receipt is merge commit
`ea59335e0cebee07dce0bf8cce5721d1f071bd03`, whose second parent is canonical
main snapshot `823b62940013279cec8a956f3007be95c534160f`. It was created by a
concurrent local audit on this same existing carrier, remained unpushed when
found, and was preserved rather than reset or overwritten. The merge is clean;
the branch-relative surface remains the same six W3 paths and the four protected
blobs remain byte-identical. Because `.github/ci/legacy-jobs.yml` moved on that
main parent, its current manifest must be revalidated before this receipt is
pushed. Once the revised gates above pass, the Chairman override authorizes
readying and arming this same PR #6286 for the normal merge lane. No W4, pack
checkout, runner-routing, topology, product, or data change is authorized here.
