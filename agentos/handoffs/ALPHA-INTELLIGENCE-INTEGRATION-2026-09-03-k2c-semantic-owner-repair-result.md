  Worker RESULT for the bounded post-merge repair
  alpha-k2c-semantic-owner-repair-20260828-sol-001, commissioned by
  agentos/handoffs/ALPHA-INTELLIGENCE-INTEGRATION-2026-08-31-k2c-semantic-owner-repair-commission.md
  under DEC-ALPHA-K2C-K3D-CURRENT-DEPENDENCY-STATE-2026-08-28. Repaired
  lib/institutional_13f_adapter.py so it can no longer emit a semantic
  positive unless BOTH owner seams (canonical security identity, canonical
  manager-complex/vehicle epochs) are proven by their real owners through
  one new keyword-only channel, run_pilot(..., owner_semantics=...). This
  is a WORKER RESULT, not K2-C acceptance -- the commissioning session
  (Fable/CTO Sol per the commission's routing) owns push/PR/CI/review/merge
  and the final REVIEW_RETURN acceptance call.
state_before: >
  Macro #6710 (per the commission) and the frozen commission carrier were
  the controlling state. lib/institutional_13f_adapter.py's _vehicle_decision()
  mapped a 13F row's investment_discretion=="SOLE" to
  decision_mode="discretionary"/vehicle_class="concentrated_discretionary_active"
  (an AUTHORITY field read as vehicle STYLE); build_recipe() minted
  mcx_filer_<CIK>/mce_filer_<CIK>_v1/veh_filer_<CIK>/vie_filer_<CIK>_v1 as
  resolution_state:"resolved" manager-complex/vehicle identity straight from
  the filer CIK; and run_pilot() could emit state=PILOT_COMPILED while its
  own security_binding.dataos_security_id stayed null. K2-C was PARTIAL /
  NOT SOL-ACCEPTED for exactly this reason.


  THIRD PASS (2026-09-03, this same session, same commit head, Sol GitHub
  review 5099850302 CHANGES_REQUESTED, commit-anchored to 339a5c3c39e0 -- the
  second-pass R1-R5 repair head). Two BLOCKERs and one MAJOR, each
  reproduced directly on 339a5c3c39e0 before any further code changed:
  (1) "SEC:US-XNYS-TOTALLYOTHER" -- parseable under lib.dataos.identity.
  parse_id, NOT the binding for the request CUSIP 037833100 -- paired with
  alias_table_resolved + caller-fabricated provenance + otherwise-valid
  epochs, was ACCEPTED, reaching PILOT_COMPILED; (2) a vehicle epoch linking
  a DIFFERENT manager_complex_id than the manager epoch's own was ACCEPTED
  -- reproduced as an uncaught lib.institutional_intelligence.
  InstitutionalIntelligenceError ("vehicle_complex_epoch_unresolved")
  escaping run_pilot via validate_recipe; (3) vehicle_class="broad_passive"
  with decision_mode="discretionary" (K2-B's own vehicle_class_decision_
  mode_conflict) was ACCEPTED, then likewise raised uncaught from
  validate_recipe AFTER build_recipe instead of refusing before it. Root
  cause per Sol's own framing (adopted as this pass's design principle):
  architectural, not a missing check -- no canonical owner artifact exists
  anywhere in this repository to verify a caller's owner_semantics mapping
  against, so a growing shape checklist (R1-R5's own approach) can only
  ever prove a payload well-FORMED, never TRUE.
changed:
  - path: lib/institutional_13f_adapter.py
    what: >
      Deleted _vehicle_decision() entirely (no longer exists on the module).
      Added typed constants SECURITY_BINDING_UNRESOLVED, MANAGER_VEHICLE_
      BINDING_UNRESOLVED, OWNER_SEMANTICS_UNRESOLVED_STATE. Added
      _validate_owner_semantics(), a strict/atomic/fail-closed validator:
      any single missing/empty/wrong-typed/partial component in a supplied
      owner_semantics payload (provenance.owner/reference_id,
      security.dataos_security_id/dataos_resolution, manager_complex_epoch,
      vehicle_epoch, each epoch's own resolution_state=="resolved") makes
      the WHOLE payload unresolved -- never partial trust, no defaults
      filled. run_pilot(store, request, *, owner_semantics=None) gates on
      the validated result BEFORE any recipe construction: unresolved ->
      state=PILOT_OWNER_SEMANTICS_UNRESOLVED with compiled_observation_
      state/recipe/compiled all None, measure={"state":"not_compiled",
      "reason":"owner_semantics_unresolved"}, and a new top-level
      owner_semantics block recording both binding states + provenance
      (None when unresolved); periods/denominators/security_binding/
      request/persistence/authority/schema/receipt_id/adapter_version/
      owner_payloads_copied are computed identically to the positive path
      either way. Resolved -> build_recipe (new signature: dropped
      investment_discretion, added manager_complex_epoch/vehicle_epoch/
      security, all owner-supplied and carried VERBATIM -- no identity
      minting, no resolution_state/status stamping) -> compile_recipe ->
      POSITIVE_STATE/NON_POSITIVE_STATE exactly as before. CLI (main/
      _build_arg_parser) unchanged in behavior (no owner_semantics flag by
      design -- frozen spec point 8, a back-door risk); its description
      text now states its real-world outcome is always the owner-unresolved
      terminal receipt. Module docstring rewritten to state the repaired
      law plainly.

      SECOND PASS (2026-09-03, adversarial-review repair of head
      2774c3f481be -- one BLOCKER + three MAJOR findings). R1 (BLOCKER):
      the paragraph above was already wrong the moment it shipped --
      "any single ... partial component" checked the security seam only
      for non-emptiness, never for actual resolvedness or grammar, so
      dataos_resolution==SECURITY_BINDING_UNRESOLVED (the schema's own
      sentinel) was accepted as proof and still reached PILOT_COMPILED.
      _validate_owner_semantics now additionally refuses the sentinel
      outright and requires dataos_security_id to parse as a well-formed
      SEC: security identity via lib.dataos.identity.parse_id (module-level
      import; no cycle -- identity.py carries zero repo-internal imports)
      inside try/except IdentityError -- asks the owner whether the string
      is well-formed under ITS OWN grammar, never resolves/mints/derives
      one. R2 (MAJOR): the validator checked only each epoch's
      resolution_state, so a structurally partial epoch (e.g. a
      vehicle_epoch missing vehicle_class) was accepted and then escaped
      run_pilot as an uncaught InstitutionalIntelligenceError out of
      build_recipe/validate_recipe -- not a lawful typed receipt. Added
      _epoch_string_fields_present() checking presence/non-empty-string
      type of exactly the keys this adapter itself consumes
      (_MANAGER_COMPLEX_EPOCH_REQUIRED_KEYS, _VEHICLE_EPOCH_REQUIRED_KEYS
      -- never the full K2-B schema, which the compiler still owns) and
      _epoch_status_contradicts_resolved() refusing
      status=="unresolved"-with-resolution_state=="resolved". R3 (MAJOR):
      the owner_semantics receipt block ("None when unresolved" above) was
      in fact emitted ONLY on the unresolved path; the positive path
      emitted no such block at all, silently discarding the validated
      provenance.owner/reference_id -- two receipts proven by two DIFFERENT
      owners were byte-identical, sharing one receipt_id. The block is now
      emitted on the positive path too, carrying provenance verbatim.
      Module docstring and _validate_owner_semantics's own docstring
      corrected to describe exactly this (no "full K2-B epoch" /
      "any single defect anywhere" overclaim beyond what the code checks).

      THIRD PASS (2026-09-03, Sol review 5099850302 repair -- two BLOCKERs +
      one MAJOR, architectural fix). Added _CANONICAL_OWNER_VERIFIERS:
      tuple = () -- an owner-verifier registry, EMPTY BY CONSTRUCTION, that
      K2-C may never populate itself (only the owning programs may, in
      their own future waves: security axis -> Data OS / Stock Identity;
      manager/vehicle -> Institutional Intelligence / K2-B) -- plus
      OWNER_VERIFIER_ABSENT = "no_canonical_owner_verifier" and 7 new
      granular shape-refusal reason constants (OWNER_SEMANTICS_MALFORMED,
      _PROVENANCE_INVALID, _SECURITY_INVALID, _SECURITY_UNRESOLVED_
      SENTINEL, _SECURITY_NOT_OWNER_GRAMMAR, _MANAGER_EPOCH_INVALID,
      _VEHICLE_EPOCH_INVALID). Replaced _validate_owner_semantics with
      _verify_owner_semantics(owner_semantics, *, cusip, cutoff) -> (payload
      | None, reason): Stage 1 keeps EVERY existing shape check unchanged
      (this is the "necessary but no longer sufficient" half); Stage 2
      hands a shape-valid payload to every verifier in
      _CANONICAL_OWNER_VERIFIERS in order -- with the registry empty, this
      ALWAYS falls through to (None, OWNER_VERIFIER_ABSENT). No new
      domain-specific conflict check (vehicle_class/decision_mode table,
      manager/vehicle cross-link check, CUSIP truth table) was added for
      findings 2/3 -- both are refused by the SAME empty-registry fallthrough
      as finding 1, which is the point: one architectural gate, not three
      patched holes. run_pilot's gate section rewritten to call
      _verify_owner_semantics and thread its (verified, reason) tuple
      through; the unresolved receipt's owner_semantics block gained a
      "reason" key (never a caller-authored provenance echo -- provenance
      stays null unconditionally on this branch, closing finding 3's
      laundering-surface concern architecturally rather than only for the
      one field R3 had restored); the positive-path branch (build_recipe/
      validate_recipe/compile_recipe/POSITIVE_STATE/NON_POSITIVE_STATE) is
      UNCHANGED code, left in place as the structure a future owner wires a
      real verifier into, but is now UNREACHABLE BY CONSTRUCTION -- every
      code path into it requires verified_owner_semantics to be non-None,
      which _verify_owner_semantics can never return while
      _CANONICAL_OWNER_VERIFIERS stays empty. Module docstring and
      run_pilot's own docstring rewritten to state this plainly (frozen
      spec point S3).
  - path: tests/test_institutional_13f_adapter_contract.py
    what: >
      Added 7 new falsifiers per the commission's required list (RED-first,
      captured against unmodified source -- see verified[] below):
      test_sole_discretion_alone_cannot_reach_a_positive,
      test_unresolved_security_binding_kills_the_positive,
      test_cik_is_not_manager_complex_identity,
      test_investment_discretion_never_selects_vehicle_semantics (asserts
      _vehicle_decision no longer exists; empty-string investment_discretion
      is proven unreachable via the owner's own catalog write-path refusal,
      documented inline, and covered instead via build_recipe's signature),
      test_owner_semantics_partial_or_unprovenanced_is_refused (8
      parametrized defect cases), test_no_repo_producer_supplies_owner_
      manager_vehicle_epochs (OWNER-BLOCKED discriminator: greps lib/
      engine/scripts/collectors/app for any manager_complex_epochs/
      vehicle_epochs producer; only this adapter is one, and it now
      requires -- never authors -- the seam), test_authority_stays_false_
      on_every_path. Added one clearly-labelled STRUCTURAL owner_semantics
      fixture (_structural_owner_semantics, commented as non-production
      evidence) used to prove the gate routes a resolved binding into the
      compiler. Repaired test_happy_path_two_period_read_compiles (now
      asserts the owner-unresolved terminal receipt; positive-path oracle
      moved to new test_owner_resolved_structural_fixture_reaches_positive_
      and_recompiles), test_determinism_same_inputs_are_byte_identical
      (now covers both owner-unresolved and owner-resolved determinism),
      test_explicit_generation_id_binds_the_exact_older_generation and
      test_amendment_known_after_cutoff_is_invisible_then_supersedes (both
      now pass the structural fixture to keep their real, orthogonal
      subject -- pointer pinning / amendment lineage -- meaningful),
      test_non_sole_discretion_compiles_non_positive_via_the_compiler (now
      reaches the compiler's own ineligibility law via an owner-resolved
      non-discretionary structural fixture, never via a bare investment_
      discretion value), test_compiled_output_is_uninjectable_and_matches_
      independent_recompute (rebuilt against the new build_recipe
      signature), test_cli_end_to_end_positive_and_refusal (now asserts
      the CLI's real-world outcome is the owner-unresolved state). Replaced
      test_vehicle_decision_mapping_is_honest_for_both_discretion_paths
      with test_investment_discretion_never_selects_vehicle_semantics per
      the commission's explicit instruction. Every other existing typed-
      refusal/adverse test (missing filing, not-yet-knowable, ambiguous
      lineage, unsupported amendment, CUSIP grammar, missing security row,
      ambiguous rows, units, raw-receipt mismatch, non-increasing periods,
      tampered object, CLI errors, denominators) is unchanged and green.

      SECOND PASS (2026-09-03, adversarial-review repair, RED-first against
      unmodified head 2774c3f481be -- captured RED, 11 failed/8 passed,
      before any adapter code changed back). Structural fixture's
      dataos_security_id changed from "SEC:STRUCTURAL:TEST" (which R1's new
      grammar check correctly rejects) to "SEC:US-XNAS-STRUCTURALTEST" (a
      syntactically well-formed SEC: id under lib.dataos.identity's own
      grammar; comment updated in place). Added
      test_unresolved_security_sentinel_cannot_prove_a_positive (R1's
      regression falsifier -- fails on 2774c3f481be with state==
      'PILOT_COMPILED' instead of the unresolved sentinel),
      test_partial_owner_epoch_is_refused_not_raised (R2 -- fails on
      2774c3f481be with an uncaught InstitutionalIntelligenceError escaping
      run_pilot via validate_recipe instead of a typed receipt),
      test_owner_provenance_is_recorded_and_distinguishes_receipts (R3 --
      fails on 2774c3f481be because two differently-provenanced positive
      receipts were byte-identical). Extended _OWNER_SEMANTICS_DEFECTS with
      7 new parametrized cases (security_unresolved_sentinel,
      security_id_not_owner_grammar[_empty_listing/_issuer_not_security],
      manager_epoch_missing_manager_complex_id,
      vehicle_epoch_missing_vehicle_class,
      epoch_status_unresolved_but_resolution_state_resolved). Added
      owner_semantics assertions to
      test_owner_resolved_structural_fixture_reaches_positive_and_recompiles
      (R3). Corrected test_no_repo_producer_supplies_owner_manager_
      vehicle_epochs's docstring (R5b): it said "Greps the repository";
      it actually greps 5 named directories for one syntactic dict-literal
      form, with named blind spots. Suite count 44 -> 54 (10 net new: 3
      standalone + 7 new matrix params).

      THIRD PASS (2026-09-03, Sol review 5099850302 repair, RED-first
      against unmodified head 339a5c3c39e0 -- see verified[] below). Removed
      the two tests whose entire premise was reaching run_pilot's now-
      unreachable positive branch:
      test_owner_resolved_structural_fixture_reaches_positive_and_recompiles
      (deleted outright -- its oracle, state==POSITIVE_STATE, is exactly
      the defect this pass exists to kill) and
      test_non_sole_discretion_compiles_non_positive_via_the_compiler /
      test_compiled_output_is_uninjectable_and_matches_independent_recompute
      (both deleted -- both asserted on receipt["compiled"], which is now
      always None regardless of owner_semantics; replaced with a comment
      block naming why and where PilotRequest's own field-surface assertion
      now lives). Re-pointed test_explicit_generation_id_binds_the_exact_
      older_generation and test_amendment_known_after_cutoff_is_invisible_
      then_supersedes at the unresolved receipt's own periods block --
      dropped owner_semantics entirely, asserted
      state==OWNER_SEMANTICS_UNRESOLVED_STATE, kept every other original
      oracle (pinned generation_id, pointer.state, the amendment accession
      switch); the amendment test's q_now==150 fact moved from the
      (now-unreachable) top-level measure block to
      periods.current.row.ssh_prn_amt=="150", which was always present
      regardless. test_determinism_same_inputs_are_byte_identical's second
      half now proves determinism of the shape-valid-but-registry-refused
      branch instead of a "resolved" branch that no longer exists.
      test_happy_path_two_period_read_compiles's owner_semantics-block
      equality assertion gained the new "reason" key
      (OWNER_SEMANTICS_MALFORMED, since no owner_semantics is supplied at
      all there). test_cik_is_not_manager_complex_identity and
      test_authority_stays_false_on_every_path both dropped their
      receipt["recipe"]["authority"]/receipt["compiled"]["authority"]
      sub-checks (recipe/compiled are always None now) and instead assert
      state==OWNER_SEMANTICS_UNRESOLVED_STATE on both call shapes.
      test_owner_provenance_is_recorded_and_distinguishes_receipts (R3's
      own falsifier -- asserted two differently-provenanced POSITIVE
      receipts were byte-DIFFERENT) is INVERTED into
      test_varying_provenance_no_longer_distinguishes_unresolved_receipts,
      proving the opposite is now true and is the intended S4 consequence:
      with positive unreachable, provenance is never echoed, so two
      payloads differing ONLY in provenance now refuse identically and
      produce BYTE-IDENTICAL receipts. Added 8 new hostile regressions:
      test_parseable_but_wrong_sec_identity_cannot_prove_a_positive
      (finding 1's exact payload; asserts owner_semantics.reason ==
      OWNER_VERIFIER_ABSENT to prove the empty registry, not a lucky shape
      check, is what refused it), test_fabricated_provenance_cannot_prove_
      a_positive, test_rich_provenance_is_not_admitted_and_never_echoed
      (provenance carrying extra owner_clock/evidence_refs fields --
      refuses, and neither fabricated string appears anywhere in the
      serialized receipt), a 5-case parametrized
      test_owner_semantics_contradiction_cannot_prove_a_positive
      (missing_manager_interval, actor_epoch_resolution_state_conflict,
      vehicle_class_decision_mode_conflict [findings 2/3's exact
      mutations], vehicle_complex_link_conflict, manager_vehicle_identity_
      mismatch -- each asserted to fall through to OWNER_VERIFIER_ABSENT,
      never a bespoke check), and test_no_canonical_owner_verifier_is_
      registered (asserts _CANONICAL_OWNER_VERIFIERS == () directly -- the
      owner-blocked discriminator). Updated the _structural_owner_semantics
      module comment and import block (dropped now-unused compile_recipe/
      compute_recipe_id/validate_recipe/build_recipe-adjacent helper
      imports that only the two deleted tests used; added
      OWNER_VERIFIER_ABSENT and a module-level `import lib.institutional_
      13f_adapter as adapter_module` alias for direct registry/constant
      access). Suite count 54 -> 60 (second pass -> third pass): -3
      deleted test items, +1 inverted-in-place test (same item count),
      +3 new standalone hostile-regression tests, +1 new 5-case
      parametrized test (5 collected items), +1 new
      test_no_canonical_owner_verifier_is_registered; verified directly
      by "pytest -q" reporting "60 passed", not by this arithmetic alone.
  - path: research/alpha_intelligence/K2C_INSTITUTIONAL_ADAPTER_PILOT_2026-08-27.md
    what: >
      Appended new "8. K2-C semantic-owner repair (2026-09-03) -- repaired
      proof + limitation" section: what defect was killed and how it maps
      to specific new tests; the repaired law and receipt shape with a full
      worked owner-unresolved example generated from the repaired module's
      own SYNTHETIC test fixture world (filer CIK 0001792167, CUSIP
      037833100/AAPL -- this is the module's own test-fixture filer/CUSIP,
      NOT the doc's real §7 production positive, which is a different
      filer/security entirely: Custos Family Office CIK 0001904423 x
      ABBVIE CUSIP 00287Y109; a since-corrected first-pass draft of this
      section conflated the two -- see the R4 correction below); and an
      explicit owner-primitive-blocker accounting (no repo producer of
      owner_semantics exists for either seam; the CLI carries no override
      flag by design; the one STRUCTURAL test fixture is explicitly not
      production evidence). No prior §0-§7 content edited or deleted.
      SECOND PASS (2026-09-03, adversarial-review repair): fixed one
      BLOCKER and three MAJOR findings an independent review found still
      open in the first pass -- see the frontmatter mission/state_before
      above and the doc's new §8.4 for the full R1-R5 accounting; also
      corrected §8.2's mislabelled exemplar (R4) and §8.3's false "consistent
      with DEC-K2C-SECURITY-BINDING-IS-OWNER-NATIVE-CUSIP" claim, which this
      repair in fact INVERTS (R5a) -- the DEC held the Data OS axis
      non-load-bearing; R1 makes it strictly load-bearing.

      THIRD PASS (2026-09-03, Sol review 5099850302 repair). Corrected §8.3's
      closing STRUCTURAL-fixture bullet in place (marked WITHDRAWN -- it had
      claimed the fixture "proves the gate machinery correctly routes a
      fully owner-resolved binding into the K2-B compiler," which findings
      1-3 falsified: shape-validity was never proof of truth) and added a
      superseding note under R3's bullet (§8.4) pointing at the new §8.5.
      Appended new "8.5 Owner-verifier-registry repair (Sol review
      5099850302, 2026-09-03)" section: the two BLOCKERs + one MAJOR
      reproduced directly on head 339a5c3c39e0; Sol's root-cause framing
      (architectural, not a missing check) adopted verbatim as this
      section's design principle; the _CANONICAL_OWNER_VERIFIERS registry
      and _verify_owner_semantics two-stage design; the "positive path
      unreachable by construction" consequence (frozen spec S3) and how
      findings 2/3 fall out of it for free rather than from a bespoke
      check; an explicit statement that no new domain-specific conflict
      check was added; and a "what this repair does NOT change" paragraph
      re-affirming every existing truthful disclosure (§8.3's two
      missing-owner-primitive facts, §8.2's un-rerun production exemplar,
      §8.3's unformalized DEC inversion) unchanged. No prior §0-§8.4
      content deleted, only the one withdrawn bullet and the one
      superseding note added in place.

    what_would_verify: >
      A real owner-read pilot run against the production institutional_13f
      store (as §7 of this same doc did pre-repair) confirming the
      OWNER_SEMANTICS_UNRESOLVED_STATE receipt shape holds for a live filer/
      CUSIP pair. This worker had no production store credentials/network
      access in-session and used only the existing test-fixture LocalStore
      pattern already established by this file's own test suite.
  - claim: "§7's own real production positive exemplar (Custos Family Office, CIK 0001904423, x ABBVIE, CUSIP 00287Y109, run 33058216623, 2026-08-27) has been re-read post-repair and now yields PILOT_OWNER_SEMANTICS_UNRESOLVED as the repaired law predicts, rather than the pre-repair PILOT_COMPILED §7 shows."
    what_would_verify: >
      A fresh real owner-read pilot run against the production
      institutional_13f store for filer CIK 0001904423 / CUSIP 00287Y109 /
      report periods 2026-03-31 -> 2026-06-30, through the same
      authorized production-read principal §7 used, executed against the
      repaired module (this commit) with no owner_semantics supplied,
      confirming it now returns state=='PILOT_OWNER_SEMANTICS_UNRESOLVED'.
      NOT DONE by either this worker's first pass or this second
      (adversarial-review-repair) pass -- both lacked production store
      credentials/network access in-session. This is the SPECIFIC
      motivating production exemplar this repair falsifies; it remains
      un-rerun, and no receipt in this doc or handoff should be read as
      having exercised it. (A first-pass draft of the doc's §8.2 incorrectly
      implied this exemplar was covered by the module's synthetic
      test-fixture worked example -- corrected under R4, see the doc's §8.2
      correction note and §8.4.)
unresolved:
  - "No repository owner currently supplies a lawful owner_semantics payload for either seam (grep-confirmed in test_no_repo_producer_supplies_owner_manager_vehicle_epochs) -- K2-C therefore still cannot reach a REAL owner-backed semantic positive; the false-positive defect is closed, but a real positive still requires a separate Data OS CUSIP-identity commission and a separate institutional/K2-B manager-vehicle-epoch commission per the commission's owner-primitive-blocker contract."
  - "This worker did not push, open a PR, or run hosted CI/fences -- the commissioning session owns that chain per its explicit instruction (do NOT push/PR/merge)."
  - "R5a (second pass): this repair's R1 fix INVERTS DEC-K2C-SECURITY-BINDING-IS-OWNER-NATIVE-CUSIP's stance (that DEC held the Data OS axis non-load-bearing; R1 makes it strictly load-bearing). The doc's §8.3 now says so plainly, but minting a formal supersession record for that DEC is explicitly Sol's call, not taken by this worker."
  - "THIRD PASS: _CANONICAL_OWNER_VERIFIERS stays empty after this repair -- the positive path is now unreachable by CONSTRUCTION rather than by convention, but that construction itself does not close the owner-primitive gap; it only makes the gap's consequence (no positive) structurally certain instead of merely well-checked. The two missing owner primitives (CUSIP->SEC resolver; manager/vehicle epoch producer) are unchanged and still block a real positive -- see the doc's new §8.5 'what this repair does NOT change' paragraph."
next_actions:
  - "Commissioning session: review this head, push, open PR, run hosted CI/fences, and carry the operation through REVIEW_RETURN per the commission's return/acceptance gate. This now covers Sol's GitHub review 5099850302 (CHANGES_REQUESTED on 339a5c3c39e0) as well as the original commission."
  - "Sol/CTO: adjudicate whether K2-C should now be recorded as 'false-positive defect closed, real positive still owner-blocked' rather than its prior PARTIAL/NOT-SOL-ACCEPTED framing, and whether a separate owner-primitive child (Data OS CUSIP identity; institutional/K2-B manager-vehicle epoch producer) should be opened."
  - "Sol/CTO: adjudicate whether DEC-K2C-SECURITY-BINDING-IS-OWNER-NATIVE-CUSIP needs a formal supersession record now that this repair's R1 fix inverts its 'typed unresolved, not load-bearing' stance (see unresolved[] above and the doc's §8.3 correction)."
  - "Whichever program eventually owns the security-identity or manager/vehicle-epoch primitive: populate _CANONICAL_OWNER_VERIFIERS with a REAL verifier (per its own docstring contract -- binds to the exact cusip/cutoff/security id/epochs/provenance) rather than working around the empty registry from inside this adapter."
do_not_redo:
  - "Do not build a CUSIP map, ticker resolver, security master, manager identity table, vehicle ontology, cache, store, scheduler, queue, or retry plane to fill the owner_semantics seam from this repair -- that is explicitly out of scope and belongs to a separate Data OS / institutional-owner commission."
  - "Do not add a CLI flag for owner_semantics -- deliberately absent; would be a back door around the owner-proof gate."
  - "Do not re-derive vehicle class or decision mode from investment_discretion, voting authority, filer CIK, manager name, or portfolio concentration anywhere in this module."
  - "Do not re-open R1-R5 (the 2026-09-03 adversarial-review findings) as if unfixed -- they are closed in this commit; if a FUTURE review finds a similar gap, treat it as a new finding with its own falsifier, not a reason to distrust these five specifically without fresh evidence."
  - "Do not treat lib.dataos.identity.parse_id succeeding on a dataos_security_id as evidence the security is real, resolved, or exists on any venue -- it only proves the STRING is well-formed under the owner's own grammar (R1's actual scope). The STRUCTURAL fixture's 'SEC:US-XNAS-STRUCTURALTEST' parses cleanly and is still explicitly not a real security."
  - "THIRD PASS: Do not add a new bespoke shape check (a vehicle_class/decision_mode conflict table, a manager/vehicle cross-link equality check, a CUSIP truth table) to _verify_owner_semantics's Stage 1 as a substitute for a real Stage-2 verifier -- that is precisely the checklist-growing pattern Sol's review named as the root cause, and it would only ever prove a payload well-formed, never true. A finding that looks like 'add one more field check' after this repair is a signal to re-read the module docstring's 'Owner VERIFICATION gate' section, not to patch Stage 1 again."
  - "THIRD PASS: Do not populate _CANONICAL_OWNER_VERIFIERS from within this repository's K2-C code -- per its own comment, only the owning programs (Data OS / Stock Identity for security; Institutional Intelligence / K2-B for manager/vehicle) may add a verifier, in their own separate commissioned waves."
danger_areas:
  - "build_recipe's manager_complex_epochs/vehicle_epochs schema (contracts/institutional_intelligence/manager_intent_recipe.v1.schema.json) requires a concrete vehicle_class even when resolution_state is unresolved -- this repair avoids that trap by refusing BEFORE constructing any recipe on the unresolved path, never by choosing a convenient placeholder class for an owner-supplied-but-unresolved epoch."
  - "The STRUCTURAL test fixture's IDs (mcx_structural_test_owner, veh_structural_test_owner, ...) are deliberately NOT filer/CIK-derived and deliberately do not match the schema's own '^mcx_[a-z0-9_]+$' etc. patterns by accident -- do not repurpose this fixture as a template for a real owner producer without a fresh Sol adjudication."
  - "_MANAGER_COMPLEX_EPOCH_REQUIRED_KEYS/_VEHICLE_EPOCH_REQUIRED_KEYS (R2, second pass) check ONLY the keys build_recipe itself reads -- they are deliberately NOT the full K2-B managerComplexEpoch/vehicleEpoch schema (interval, lineage, actor_identity, etc. are unchecked here). A future caller that supplies a structurally-complete-by-this-check but K2-B-schema-invalid epoch still reaches validate_recipe and gets K2-B's own InstitutionalIntelligenceError, not a typed adapter refusal -- that boundary is deliberate (K2-B owns its own schema) but is easy to mistake for a gap if you haven't read this note. THIRD PASS note: this boundary is now moot in practice -- validate_recipe is never reached at all while _CANONICAL_OWNER_VERIFIERS stays empty -- but it stays documented here because it becomes live again the moment a real verifier is wired in."
  - "THIRD PASS: run_pilot's post-verification branch (build_recipe through the POSITIVE_STATE/NON_POSITIVE_STATE body) is INTENTIONALLY unreachable dead code today, not an oversight -- do not 'clean it up' or delete it without re-reading the module docstring's 'Owner VERIFICATION gate' section first; it is the structure a future owner verifier wires into, per frozen spec point S3."

# K2-C semantic-owner repair — worker RESULT

**Operation key:** `alpha-k2c-semantic-owner-repair-20260828-sol-001`
**Branch/head:** `claude/alpha-k2c-semantic-owner-repair-20260903` (not pushed by this worker)
**Base:** `origin/main` @ `12e96892723d79516bebfd3ec9075c7d420b1dc7`
**Third-pass trigger:** Sol GitHub review `5099850302` (CHANGES_REQUESTED,
commit-anchored to `339a5c3c39e0` — the second-pass R1-R5 repair head).

See frontmatter `changed`/`verified` for the full file-by-file diff and command
evidence, and `research/alpha_intelligence/K2C_INSTITUTIONAL_ADAPTER_PILOT_2026-08-27.md`
§8 (through the new §8.5) for the repaired receipt shape, a full worked
example, and the architectural owner-verifier-registry fix this third pass
implemented.

This is a worker RESULT only — the commissioning session owns push, PR, hosted
CI/fences, review, and the final `REVIEW_RETURN` acceptance call per the
commission's explicit routing.
