session: claude/b-tripwire-dividend-proof
model: fable
ended_because: complete
mission: >
  Heal the fleet-wide CI red caused by W1-A1's exact-equality digest over the live
  B OHLCV plane, as the owning session, without re-stamping the registered constant.
state_before: >
  origin/main was red from 2026-08-18T04:02Z on the exact-digest check. PR #5865 landed
  the storage half while this session's competing full heal (#5868) was in adversarial
  review; #5868 was CLOSED as superseded rather than force-merged, because rebasing it
  would have reverted a merged sibling heal. What #5865 left behind is the subject here:
  its tripwire bands the price LEVEL at 1e-5, which fires on any future dividend, and its
  blanket 1e-2 volume tolerance hides a settled-session restatement. A second, unrelated
  pack (unrun-government-revenue) is red on main and is NOT covered by this work.
changed:
  - path: scripts/stock_identity_build_w1a1.py
    what: >
      Live-plane tripwire re-expressed on invariants: per-row O/H/L/C coherence, per-row
      factor residual against the window median (replacing the per-column LEVEL band),
      settled volume required exact with a band only on the ASOF bar, and a gross-rescale
      sanity bound checked after volume.
  - path: tests/test_stock_identity_atlas.py
    what: >
      Added both directions — four return-preserving rescales (three dividend scales plus
      a deep 0.85x) must PASS; split, settled-volume +0.5%, one-column move above the
      float32 grid, segment restatement, asof-volume blowout and broken vendor frame must
      FIRE. All ten fail against main's pre-change builder.
  - path: research/stock_identity/W1_IDENTITY_ATLAS_V0_REGISTRATION.md
    what: >
      Struck the false "post-asof appends may not move it" premise, which #5865 left in
      place, and registered §A1.3a — the snapshot, the measured drift, and why the band is
      on uniformity rather than level.
  - path: agentos/decisions/DEC-SEALED-INPUTS-ARE-FROZEN-NOT-REPINNED.md
    what: NEW decision record; the adjudication DSC:SEALED-PIN-ON-A-NIGHTLY-OWNED-PATH referred to Stock Identity.

unverified:
  - claim: >
      The 1e-5 residual band has decades of headroom against accumulation across a
      lengthening back-adjustment chain.
    what_would_verify: >
      Re-measure the residual after several dividends have passed the asof (next natural
      check ~Q4 2026). The three collections measured span four days and contain no
      dividend, so they bound re-derivation jitter only. Nothing re-measures this
      automatically — the tripwire has no telemetry, so drift toward the band would
      surface as a fleet red rather than as a warning.
  - claim: Raw O/H/L prints are stable at the float32 grid over long horizons.
    what_would_verify: >
      Sample the raw (unadjusted) prints across many collection nights. Observed stable
      over 3 collections/4 days; the 1e-6 coherence band was chosen to tolerate a 1-ULP
      wobble precisely because the frequency is unmeasured.

do_not_redo:
  - >
      Do NOT re-stamp B_SOURCE_PREFIX_SHA256 to a fresh digest. The live file is rewritten
      every collection night; a re-stamp re-reds the same evening and requires editing
      sealed A1 receipts the builder's REFUSING guard protects.
  - >
      Do NOT band the price LEVEL (|ratio-1|) in the tripwire, which is the obvious
      reading of "tolerance-aware". auto_adjust rescales all elapsed history on every
      future dividend (~2.4e-3, ~240x the noise floor), so a level band fires on the next
      ordinary Barrick dividend. Band the UNIFORMITY (residual vs the window median factor).
  - >
      Do NOT quantize-then-hash as a way to keep an equality check. Rounding flips
      whenever a value sits within the drift of a boundary; with ~9,500 price cells and
      drift ~8.6e-07 the granularity needed to hold flip risk under 1% is ~1.6 relative.
  - >
      Do NOT tighten the coherence band to the observed 4.4e-16. That sits ~5 orders BELOW
      the float32 grid of the raw prints (~6e-8); a 1-ULP wobble or a yfinance bump would
      then report vendor noise as a print revision.
  - >
      Do NOT edit the sealed receipts naming 6d8988fc (episodes/amendments/B.json,
      amendments/w1a1_gold_wrong_issuer.json) — the snapshot re-anchors that digest, so
      they are already true and were deliberately left byte-identical.

      The pack index in a failure report is not identity. This red was reported as
      ci-pack-7 and was actually ci-pack-3; run_ci_pack.py rebalances by job weight.

      The registration is hash-pinned: editing anything inside the §4 partition procedure

      The tripwire's checks are ORDER-DEPENDENT by design: coherence before the median
      (a one-column outlier must not be absorbed), and volume before the gross-rescale
      bound (a real split must be diagnosed as a corporate action, not as a broken vendor
      frame). Reordering them silently degrades the diagnosis.

## Why this took an architecture change rather than a new digest

The registration asserted that only post-asof appends could move the pinned prefix. That
premise was false for this file from the day it was written: `fetch_basket_ohlcv.py`
re-downloads the full auto-adjusted history nightly and lets the new vendor frame win, so
the already-elapsed 2014..asof window is re-derived every night. The pin survived three
days only because of a weekend plus the 08-15→17 ruleset push freeze.

The load-bearing move is that the fix **re-anchors** the receipt instead of re-stamping
it: the seed blob still reproduces `6d8988fc` exactly, so the constant, its five mirrors
and both sealed receipts are untouched and remain true. Freezing also repaired something
CI had not yet caught — a sealed result whose inputs drift nightly could no longer
reproduce its own sealed outputs, so the seal was already nominal.

The subtler half is the tripwire's calibration, and it is where a plausible fix fails.
Banding the price *level* passes today's noise and fires on the next ordinary dividend,
which would have reproduced this same fleet red on a quarterly clock. The invariant that
actually protects A1 is the *uniformity* of the rescale: any uniform rescale preserves
every return, drawdown and percentage gap, so it cannot move a conclusion, while a change
in relative prices can. Corporate actions remain covered on a separate channel, because
split adjustment rescales share counts and settled volume must match exactly.

## Final session state (appended at stop)

The record above was written mid-session. What follows is what the session actually
ended as, so a stranger does not have to reconstruct it from PR archaeology.

**Both PRs merged and live-verified.** `#5875` (this record's subject) merged
2026-08-18T08:21:18Z as `9cf29183`. A second, unrelated heal followed: `#5888`
(`claude/leader-radar-grade-join-heal`, merged 10:44:13Z as `e343b8be`) fixed
`_build_fire_history` in `scripts/build_leader_radar.py`, which accepted `data_root` and
ignored it — it read the ambient grade ledger, so its documented "grades absent" branch
had never once executed. It went red only when the nightly graded
`(plab_leader_onset, CRWD, 2026-07-15)` and `accruing` became `matured`.

**Both are proven green on a main descendant, affirmatively.** Baseline
`32128288210` (head `e343b8be`, covering both merges): `ci-pack-3` `conclusion: success`,
`Selected jobs:` containing BOTH `trial-budgets` and `leader-radar-unit`, and
`CI_PACK_FAILED_JOBS=[]` — an empty list, not merely an absence of red.

**The session nevertheless ended SHIP LOOP BLOCKED, and the reason is durable.**
Both PRs touch `scripts/**`, so semantic evidence records `authority_changed=true`. In
`.claude/hooks/ship_loop_guard.py`, `_semantic_has_nonunit_blocker()` returns True on that
flag (:1146) and the merged-head path refuses on it BEFORE per-unit attribution (:2098) —
so sibling attribution, base-inherited excuses and descendant healing are all structurally
unavailable. The only clearing condition is the PR's OWN run being clean, which is frozen
at merge. **Merging an authority-changing PR while main is red therefore buys a
permanently unclearable gate**; nothing done afterwards, including healing main, can
clear it. Treat this as a merge-time check, not a post-merge repair.

**Main's red set rotates**, which is why per-pack chasing does not converge here:
`{5}` (08:12Z) → `{3,4,5,9}` (09:02Z) → `{6,10}` (a merge ref) → `{1,4,5,9}` (11:2xZ) →
`{5}` (12:0xZ). Diagnostic before healing any pack: compare failing job NAMES across two
consecutive baselines — same names mean a real break, different names mean the
live-nightly-data family. At session end main was ONE red from green (`contract-drift`,
owned by armed PR #5874).

**Two of this session's own branches were abandoned rather than merged**, both because a
sibling landed first and forcing through would have reverted merged work: the original
W1-A1 heal (`#5868`, superseded by `#5865`) and an `unrun-hk-board` fixture re-pin
(superseded by `DEC:HK-G1-FIXTURE-BANDS-THE-REFRESH-SUFFIX`, which bands the drift SHAPE
via `rescale_diagnosis` instead of re-pinning — the durable form, since a re-pin recurs on
the next dividend).

**Open, with receipts, not carried by this workstream:** a data-loss hazard where a
partially-successful `worktree_sparse.py add site` left tracked `site/flow/CORZ.json` at
0 bytes against 5040 at HEAD (restored via `git show HEAD:<path> > <path>`, which needs no
index). Three candidate mechanisms are DISPROVEN by reproduction — a held `index.lock`
fails cleanly without creating the file; `git reset --hard` in a sparse tree leaves no
husk; `_drop_husks()` only rmdirs empty directories. The surviving hypothesis is partial
materialization during a large add. Separately, `scripts/check_contract_drift.py`
UNDER-reports in a sparse worktree — it printed `0 drift(s), 6 clean, 5 skipped (no live
sample)` and exited 0 while failing in CI, so a local GREEN is as untrustworthy as a local
red there.
