mission: >
  Route only ordinary same-repository PR pack execution through the exact
  protected-main trusted executor while keeping the hosted planner, stable
  ci-pack-N anchors, semantic gate, fork path, fences and merge controller.
state_before: >
  P3B-A PR #6496 merged as 904863dabc490ee95ac50153048c25dee048d90b.
  The exact main-owned executor accepted a zero-input same-repository PR call,
  but ci.yml still ran every pack fully hosted. Exact-head run 33035115527 spent
  about 180.7 hosted pack-minutes across twelve successful pack jobs.
changed:
  - path: .github/workflows/ci.yml
    what: >
      Add one zero-input same-repository call to the exact main executor; retain
      full hosted fork execution; turn existing hosted ci-pack-N jobs into
      trusted-fragment relays after exact hosted/main plan-SHA parity.
  - path: .github/workflows/trusted-ci-executor.yml

next_actions:

do_not_redo:
  - Do not rerun P1, P2, P3A, P3A-R or P3B-A.
  - Do not move hosted planner/gate/fork/fences/merge control to home hardware.
  - Do not let the caller supply SHA, base, plan, route inputs or inherited secrets.
  - Do not create a scheduler, queue, retry, lifecycle or semantic-proof plane.
  - Do not admit generic M1/macstudio or recruit M4 hardware in this wave.
danger_areas:
  - >
    Candidate-authored ci.yml may request the main call but cannot define the
    trusted jobs. github.workflow_ref binds the caller while job.workflow_ref and
    job.workflow_sha bind the called main definition.
  - >
    A green trusted executor is insufficient if the hosted and main-derived plan
    SHAs diverge; every anchor must fail before relaying a mismatched fragment.
  - >
    Skipped reusable jobs change needs semantics. ci-pack uses always() so forks
    retain hosted execution, but same-repository anchors require trusted success.

# P3B-B trusted-CI production route

## Observable mission

Eliminate long hosted checkout/materialization for ordinary same-repository PR
packs by executing the exact main-derived plan on the accepted three-slot PC
pool, without granting candidate-authored workflow code direct runner access.

## Acceptance boundary

- Exact caller syntax: `mastermindx-market-intelligence/macro/.github/workflows/trusted-ci-executor.yml@main`.
- Runner-group selected-workflow policy remains pinned separately to `@refs/heads/main`.
- No `with`, no inherited secrets and no direct group/label use in `ci.yml`;
  the call grants only contents read and pull-requests read.
- Same-repository PR: trusted executor plus tiny hosted `ci-pack-N` relays.
- Fork PR: existing complete hosted pack implementation.
- Hosted planner SHA must equal trusted planner SHA and fragment `plan_sha256`.
- Existing artifact names, `ci-gate`, contract delta, fences and merge controller remain.
- Called executor remains the only `macro-home-canary` group consumer and stays
  capped at three `ci-linux` jobs.

## Stop condition

Stop P3B-B after its exact PR tree proves the real PC route and merges without
bypass. Do not call the program complete: P4 still owes three natural product PR
proofs, post-cutover hosted-minute/resource/amplification telemetry and the
private-cutover acceptance packet. Repository visibility remains unchanged.
