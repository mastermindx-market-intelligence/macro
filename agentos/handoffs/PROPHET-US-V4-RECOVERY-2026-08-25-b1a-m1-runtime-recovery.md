mission: >
  B1-A: recover the governed M1 publisher runtime if recoverable, or ratify a
  truthful replacement pin if not; then commission merged PR #6363 (M1 private
  publisher Git hardening) onto the governed runtime and obtain natural
  scheduler proof. Explicitly NOT the Chairman-only visibility flip.

state_before: >
  #6363 merged 2026-08-24T14:36:44Z as deb53e6f389b227a9fe47709922b542c3c3fd9b3
  with no install and no natural-cycle claim. A post-merge comment on that PR
  reported the M1 publisher paths absent and declared
  `EXTERNAL_CAPABILITY_BLOCKED: governed M1 engine checkout
  /Users/chriswong/flow-ops-wt and its unrecoverable dirty pin state are
  unavailable`, asserting that operator restoration or a ratified replacement-pin
  migration was the only lawful next step. The accepted Day-6 record
  (DEC:B1-MACRO-PRIVATE-CUTOVER) instead recorded the M1 pin as a deliberate
  operator matter and NOT a flip blocker.

    installing #6363 closes the wrong-account path for the TWO lanes it covers, but a

    `https://github.com/chriswong6031-creator/macro.git` anonymously with no auth
    config, surviving only on GitHub's repo-move redirect, and it is CURRENT:
    FETCH_HEAD mtime 2026-08-25T13:48:31 PDT, HEAD f0ccbd37 = canonical main that
    minute. Loaded agent `com.macro.live-breadth` rides it. This WILL hard-fail at
    the visibility flip. Day-6's Wave A/B migration covered the VPS `/opt/macro` and
    the Mastermind vendor symlink; it did not enumerate M1-local anonymous consumers.
    Treat this as a blocking input to MACRO-PRIVATE-CUTOVER READY.
  - >
    Dormant, lower priority: `~/hub-ops-wt` is on
    `git@github.com:chriswong6031-creator/macro.git` and is referenced by three loaded
    agents (`com.mastermind.optionshub`, `com.mastermind.levelsseal`,
    `com.mastermind.levelsgrader`), but its FETCH_HEAD mtime is 2026-08-02T20:22:55 —
    three weeks stale, so it is not actively pulling. `~/fund-engine-wt` is likewise on
    a wrong-account HTTPS remote with no loaded agent referencing it. Enumerate and
    migrate these under the cutover packet, not here.
  - "The legacy push repos ~/indexgex-push-repo and ~/witness-push-repo still point at https://github.com/chriswong6031-creator/macro and are now ORPHANED by the install. They are disposable and self-recreating; deleting them is an operator hygiene call, not a B1-A act."
  - "PR #6363's shipped plists fail strict XML parsing (stdlib plistlib) because the embedded documentation comments contain `--`, which XML forbids inside comments. macOS CFPropertyList/plutil accept them, so launchd is unaffected and `plutil -lint` is green. Cosmetic-but-real portability wart; not a blocker."

next_actions:
  - >
    Bank the theme-options-witness natural receipt from the 2026-08-25 17:15 PDT
    execution (or, if that cycle is missed, the next weekday 17:15). Do NOT hand-run
    the lane and present the output as production proof.
  - "On 2026-08-30 20:00 PDT bank the index/GEX natural receipt the same way; do NOT dispatch it by hand."
  - >
    Each natural receipt is banked in its OWN later records PR by whichever session
    observes that cycle. This PR is BUILT_NOT_PROVEN and carries neither receipt.
  - >
    Commission a SEPARATE bounded cutover-consumer wave to migrate the M1-local
    anonymous consumers — `~/macro-live` first (LIVE: FETCH_HEAD 2026-08-25T13:48:31,
    loaded agent com.macro.live-breadth), then the dormant `~/hub-ops-wt` and
    `~/fund-engine-wt`. #6418 was deliberately NOT widened to this.
  - >
    MACRO-PRIVATE-CUTOVER READY stays WITHHELD until BOTH lane receipts exist AND the
    macro-live consumer wave lands. Only then does the private-cutover packet return
    to Sol; the visibility flip remains the Chairman's isolated act.

do_not_redo:
  - "Do NOT re-diagnose the M1 runtime as lost from an absent path on whatever Mac a session occupies. Probe the M1 over Tailscale (`ssh m1`) FIRST. See DSC:M1-PUBLISHER-RUNTIME-IS-HOST-LOCAL-AND-DELIBERATELY-PINNED."
  - "Do NOT advance, reset, clean, or reconstruct /Users/chriswong/flow-ops-wt. Its detached dirty pin at a5f79c83 is the deliberate engine that the merged #6363 lanes consume via PYTHONPATH/WorkingDirectory/.env. Normalizing it destroys the governed runtime."
  - "Do NOT execute a replacement-pin migration for this runtime. It was recovered; supersession is not triggered. See DEC:B1A-M1-RUNTIME-RECOVERED-NO-SUPERSESSION."
  - "Do NOT treat the 2026-08-24 PR #6363 comment as a Sol ruling. It is a session terminal note scoped to the commissioning Mac."
  - "Do NOT hand-run the publisher lanes and present the output as production proof; both lanes must be observed on their own schedulers."

danger_areas:
  - "flow-ops-wt's gitdir is a linked worktree under ~/Documents, which macOS TCC denies to launchd agents. That is WHY the lanes push from a separate $HOME push repo. Never 'simplify' the lane to git directly inside flow-ops-wt — it will fail under launchd only, not when you test it by hand."
  - "The old lanes' pushes to chriswong6031-creator/macro succeeded only via GitHub's repo-move redirect. Any lane still on that remote will hard-fail at the private flip, silently until then."
  - "Rollback is `cp <plist>.b1a-pre-6363-20260825T205200Z <plist>` then unload/load — but rolling back re-arms the wrong-account push path, so roll back only for a genuine lane failure, never for tidiness."
  - "macro_machine_git.py fails closed on ANY unknown repository-local config key. A future session that runs a stray `git config` inside a push repo will wedge that lane until the repo is deleted and re-cloned."

The governed M1 publisher runtime was **recovered, not replaced**. It was never
lost: `/Users/chriswong/flow-ops-wt` sits on the M1 exactly where the Day-6
record said it did, at exactly the pin the Day-6 record named, with its dirty
state intact and cryptographically fixed by a `git status --porcelain` digest
captured before any mutation. Both that digest and a point-in-time `git diff
HEAD` digest were re-verified byte-identical immediately after commissioning,
which establishes that the install itself changed nothing during that interval.
Only the status digest is carried forward as the durable invariant: this is a
live tree, and its diff digest is expected to move as the production lanes it
serves rewrite data artifacts.

The competing claim — that the checkout was unrecoverable and that installation,
natural proof, and cutover were therefore blocked — came from a PR comment whose
own first clause scopes it to "the commissioning Mac". That machine is the M2.
The runtime is host-local to the M1. An absent path on one host was generalized
into a loss verdict, and that verdict would, if honored, have authorized exactly
the destructive act this mission forbids: superseding a live governed runtime
with a replacement pin.

Commissioning #6363 required no replacement and no change to the pinned engine.
The merged design deliberately separates a **current, disposable launcher** from
a **deliberately pinned engine**, so the install was purely additive: one clean
governed clone, two plist swaps, both backed up. The dirty pin is not damage to
be repaired — it is load-bearing state the merged contract depends on.
