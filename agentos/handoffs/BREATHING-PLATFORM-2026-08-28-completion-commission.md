  The 2026-08-27 forensic reconciliation correctly left W-ACCEPT open at zero
  proven green sessions, but current truth has moved again: D12 producer repair
  #6554 merged as BUILT_NOT_PROVEN; B1 intake repair #6562 merged; and #6569
  merged fresh-empty plus ahead-pack sentinel fences after the real Aug-27 live
  plane was globally dark/empty while the sentinel remained green.

unverified:

  - "Board as_of, live pass_ts/quote clock, armed-pack as_of, and nightly source_asof are independent clocks; conflating them reproduces the Aug-27 false-green."
  - "A fresh artifact timestamp on one plane while another required plane is stale/empty reads as healthy to the sentinel; empty states is not healthy and missing is not zero."
  - "Missing reader timestamps stay missing/FAIL; inferring them from R2 or file mtime rewrites first-visibility history."

# COO program-control handoff

## Program operation

`breathing-completion-program-20260828-sol-001`

This is the parent communication/program-control identity. It is **not** a license to execute every child wave. Every modifying child wave receives a fresh operation key and explicit Sol edge.

## Receiver mode

`RECEIVER_MODE: OPEN_PICKUP`

**Recommended receiver:** Fable, acting as principal COO/program-control partner.

No worker may self-claim merely because it reads this packet in GitHub/Slack/history. Chairman must assign the exact receiver in the live Slack thread. Once assigned, that delivery/assignment is sufficient; do not ask the Chairman to assign the same receiver a second time.

### Routing receipt

`ROUTE: Fable + Claude Code / equivalent sustained repository surface`

`WHY: The first mission is production-state archaeology across Breathing close-pass, Prophet Availability/D12/permanence, Massive source seams and browser-visible multi-clock truth; it must remain coherent across natural sessions rather than optimizing one file.`

`WHY FABLE: Current causal truth changed multiple times inside the preceding market day (#6554, #6562, #6569). Principal continuity is justified to adjudicate owner boundaries and preserve the full acceptance thesis. Later frozen implementation slices should route to cheaper bounded workers when appropriate.`

# Child C0 — production truth + acceptance recovery

**Operation key:** `breathing-c0-production-truth-20260828-sol-001`

## Pickup contract

After Chairman assigns the exact receiver in the Slack thread:

1. Post `PICKUP_ACK breathing-c0-production-truth-20260828-sol-001` (or the currently accepted equivalent) in that exact thread and identify the receiver/session.
2. Read the complete thread and the canonical sources below before acting.
3. **Actually arm the exact-thread continuation watcher before ending pickup** and post a truthful `WATCH_ARMED` receipt with mechanism, carrier/thread, baseline, cadence and trigger.
4. Separately state `START breathing-c0-production-truth-20260828-sol-001` when the execution gate is clear. ACK is not START.
5. Keep every `BLOCKED`, `DECISION_REQUEST`, `PROGRESS`, `RESULT` in the same thread.
6. After every nonterminal return, re-arm the watcher after your next return.
7. Do not start C1 or any implementation wave from an old watcher or this parent packet. Sol must issue the next explicit operation/CONTINUE edge.

## Observable mission

Return one authoritative production-truth dossier that tells Sol exactly which Breathing completion gates are already naturally proven after #6554/#6569/#6534 and what the **first actual causal gap** is, without modifying code or production state.

## Why it matters

The program is now acceptance-bound, and the worst failure mode is building a stale fix while today's source/reader truth has already moved. C0 prevents duplicate architecture and turns the next wave into one evidence-caused vertical.

## Authority / document precedence

1. Current Chairman directive in the live Sol session.
2. Protected Skillpack `mastermindx-market-intelligence/Mastermind@038d1271b98e88b24e039c1ce4127d6503945845` and its universal dialogue/routing laws.
3. `research/BREATHING_PLATFORM_COMPLETION_MASTERPLAN_2026-08-28.md` after it lands on current Macro main.
4. Current `agentos/workstreams/WS-BREATHING-PLATFORM.md` and owner workstreams.
5. Current Macro `main` / merged PRs / immutable production receipts.
6. Slack only for this exact carrier's hot dialogue state.

If a newer colliding source-law or implementation PR lands during C0, stop at the affected claim, re-pin current main, and reconcile rather than grading stale bytes.

## Verified pickup state

At freeze base `ba270c60c1fe825f2e9fce1fcf507b7272a67b63`:

- #6554 D12 producer quarantine is merged and **BUILT_NOT_PROVEN**.
- #6569 empty-state/ahead-pack sentinel fences are merged and **BUILT_NOT_PROVEN**.
- #6534 permanence net is merged and still owes natural production proof.
- #6532 U.S. board freshness copy/clock semantics are merged; production browser acceptance remains a Breathing gate.
- #6562 B1 ndarray intake crash repair is adjacent and merged; do not absorb its semantics.
- No direct open PR match was found for `close_pass`, `prophet_live`, or `massive_stock_day` at the freeze. Re-check on pickup.

## Exact scope

Read-only production/repository archaeology only. Expected sources include:

- `WS:BREATHING-PLATFORM` + its 2026-08-27/28 handoffs;
- `WS:PROPHET-US-AVAILABILITY` + force-majeure/D12 records;
- #6554, #6569, #6534, #6532, #6562 and any newer descendant;
- actual host close-pass run receipts for Aug 26/Aug 27 if retained;
- sentinel `first_fresh` / SLA state and `staleness.json` history where available;
- current served `live/us_board_provisional.json` and evaluator `live/prophet_live.json` identity/clocks;
- current armed pack basis and current nightly board/session clocks;
- browser/DOM proof when accessible without mutation.

## Explicit non-goals

- no source/code edits;
- no production config edits;
- no workflow/manual dispatch to manufacture proof;
- no replay/backfill;
- no third writer or alternate artifact;
- no rank/gate/entry semantics changes;
- no W-L2 optimization yet;
- no new alert/monitor path;
- no automatic merge.

## Complete journey to inspect

Natural session close truth → host close-pass receipt → candidate artifact → R2/VPS mirror → `board_state` CAS into the existing evaluator document → browser identity qualification → visible provisional board; in parallel inspect independent Prophet-Live pass/quote/non-vacuity + armed-pack basis + sentinel/permanence verdict.

The dossier must show whether a fresh board coexisted with stale/empty Prophet-Live and whether the browser/monitoring told that truth correctly.

## Time / null / correction law

- `close_observed_at`, `first_candidate_at`, `first_user_visible_at` are distinct first-observation clocks.
- Missing reader timestamp stays missing/FAIL; never infer it from R2 or file mtime.
- Board `as_of`, live `pass_ts`/quote clock, armed-pack `as_of`, and nightly `source_asof` remain independent.
- A later successful tick cannot rewrite an earlier missed first-visibility receipt.
- Empty `states` is not healthy; missing is not zero.

## Required C0 output

Return a single table for Aug 26, Aug 27, and the current post-merge state with:

- session;
- deployed code identity;
- `close_observed_at`;
- `first_candidate_at`;
- `first_user_visible_at`;
- close→candidate / candidate→visible gaps;
- universe count / evaluated / typed exclusions;
- board `as_of` and visible freshness semantics;
- Prophet-Live pass/quote/non-vacuity;
- armed-pack `as_of` / completed-through / D12 status;
- sentinel + permanence verdict;
- browser truth/degraded-state observation;
- PASS / FAIL / UNVERIFIED and exact causal reason.

Then provide:

1. current capability ledger using `PROVEN_LIVE`, `BUILT_NOT_PROVEN`, `PARTIAL`, `DARK_OR_DISCONNECTED`, `BROKEN`, `SPEC_ONLY`, `NOT_BUILT`, `REJECTED_BY_DESIGN`;
2. current collision map/open PRs;
3. the one first causal gap;
4. recommended next child operation, scope and worker route.

## Acceptance test for C0 itself

C0 passes when every above field is either evidenced or explicitly `UNKNOWN/MISSING`, and no conclusion depends on reconstructing unavailable reader history. A dossier that says “healthy” from one artifact timestamp while another required plane is stale/empty fails C0.

## Stop condition

**Do not modify anything.** If C0 discovers a repair is required, return `DECISION_REQUEST` or `RESULT` with the exact causal defect and proposed bounded C1/C2 child. Wait for Sol's explicit same-thread edge.

## Continuation return

Include current main SHA, deployed/source identities, evidence locations/commands, all unknowns, collision findings and the exact next operation proposal. Then re-arm the thread watcher and wait for Sol.

## Terminal behavior

When Sol eventually posts `SOL ACCEPTED / STOP` or `SOL STOP` for this child, C0 is terminal: stop C0 work, disarm the temporary watcher, do not start another child, and no further reply is required unless watcher shutdown fails (`WATCH_STOP_FAILED`).
