mission: >
  Implement the frozen TFG source-native separator/identity law inside the existing deterministic
  Q&A compiler, prove it against the frozen 16-call development adjudication, freeze the
  implementation head, then unseal and score the eight-slot unseen format holdout once, returning
  DRAFT/HOLD-FOR-SOL without widening production publication.

  TFG-0 was Sol-accepted and merged as a2dd436722dd0e6c6cb1e17bfa1c888c706c15d0. It measured the
  unchanged compiler at 0/16 on a pre-registered 16-revision development corpus, froze the
  source-conditioned separator/proxy/role law, and froze an eight-revision metadata-only holdout
  (ranks 17-24) that had never been opened. E3-C was open; E3-P locked.

      Records why TFG-1 stopped at the development gate: the frozen development adjudication
      undercounts structural separators by three, which moves MBLY/2026Q2 out of the source-clean
      set and makes the frozen 10/10 source-clean gate unsatisfiable without inventing an
      unlawful exclusion rule. States the three rulings Sol is asked to make.

# TFG-1 stopped at the development gate

The frozen TFG separator law was implemented faithfully and measured against the frozen 16-call
development adjudication. It recovers every one of the 110 adjudicated handoffs with zero false
negatives and extracts the questioner name exactly on all 95 frozen direct matches — and it finds
three more genuine structural separators that the frozen receipt omits.

The three are each the segment where the Operator both opens the Q&A session and names the first
questioner: `MBLY/2026Q2` #21, `ARRY/2026Q2` #31, `KREF/2026Q2` #15. Thirteen of the sixteen calls
contain that identical construction and the frozen receipt counts all thirteen, so this is an
inconsistency in the gold rather than a detector artifact. Probe truncation and a deliberate
first-handoff convention were both tested and falsified.

Correcting the omission moves `MBLY/2026Q2` out of the source-clean set, because its first handoff
resolves to a structured placeholder with first-name-only self-identification — the frozen
unresolved class. The frozen development gate demands non-empty reconstruction on all ten
source-clean calls, so that gate is now unsatisfiable without inventing an exclusion rule the
dispatch explicitly forbids. Under the dispatch stop conditions the wave returns the falsifier
rather than rescuing it.

No compiler source was changed, production admission remains AAPL-only, and the eight-slot holdout
remains sealed and unopened.

## RESOLVED BY SOL — 2026-08-27

Sol ruled **YES / YES / YES** on the three questions in section 7 of
`research/earnings_intelligence/e3/TFG1_DEVELOPMENT_ADJUDICATION_FALSIFIER_2026-08-27.md`, and
independently verified the three omitted first-Q&A handoffs against the original frozen gold before
doing so. The worker STOP was confirmed correct. Nothing in this record is awaiting Sol.

The ratified development truth is **113 structural separators / 97 direct / 6 explicit proxies /
103 source-supported / 10 unresolved / 9 source-clean calls / 7 expected-refusal calls**, recorded as
`DEC:E3FMT-DEVELOPMENT-GOLD-R2-FIRST-HANDOFF-OMISSIONS` with machine gold
`research/earnings_intelligence/e3/tfg1_development_boundary_identity_adjudication_r2.json`.
`MBLY/2026Q2` #21 is a mandatory separator whose questioner stays unresolved, so MBLY leaves the
source-clean set — not a rescued identity. The historical 110-boundary TFG-0 receipt is preserved
unchanged as falsified evidence and must not be used as current grading truth.

This v1 operation is therefore **terminal and spent** at `STOPPED_AT_DEVELOPMENT_GATE`. The
measurement receipts above, including the `863 records` AgentOS result, are preserved as the
historical evidence of that stop and are not current-head validation.

The successor is a **distinct logical operation**,
`tfg1-r2-deterministic-transcript-format-hardening-20260827-v1`, whose sole packet is
`research/earnings_intelligence/e3/TFG1_R2_DETERMINISTIC_TRANSCRIPT_FORMAT_HARDENING_HANDOFF_2026-08-27.md`.
It is **NOT_BUILT and not commissioned**, and may not begin until this v1 closeout PR #6555 is
Sol-accepted and landed. The v1 operation key must not be reused. The eight holdout revisions remain
sealed (`holdout_bodies_inspected: 0`).
