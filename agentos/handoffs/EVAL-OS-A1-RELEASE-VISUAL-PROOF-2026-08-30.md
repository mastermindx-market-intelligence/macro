mission: >
  Close the remaining A1 release gate without reopening either terminal A1 worker child: retain
  Macro PR #6651 as the sole implementation carrier, reconcile it against then-current Macro main,
  preserve all newer current-main authority on overlapping A1 paths, prove the binding dual-theme UI
  law on the existing Intelligence OS admin evidence view, repair only a demonstrated A1-owned visual
  or current-base integration defect on that same carrier if required, and return one immutable
  release candidate for separate Sol-controlled merge, deploy, authenticated production proof, and
  durable closeout.
state_before: >
  The fresh A1 recovery child eval-os-a1-pr6651-recovery-20260829-sol-001 is terminal via explicit
  SOL ACCEPTED / STOP. Its repository effect is banked at PR #6651 head
  036d5bc01606fc8cb8349094d05c47fb98b6cf7b as APPLIED_REMOTE_DRAFT / BUILT_NOT_PROVEN /
  PRODUCTION_INERT. Exact-head hosted CI and independent code review converged, but the worker proved
  that admin/static is outside the current UI visual-evidence checker and no required dark/light
  evidence matrix exists. Current Macro design law makes that omission PARTIAL/BLOCKED for a material
  user-facing surface, so release remains unlawful until visual proof is complete. Current main also
  contains newer authoritative edits on A1-owned admin paths from merged PR #6767 / commit
  06bed3b19330728e7d46b9f69fd535f749e51a69; those bytes and tests must survive A1 release. Current
  main additionally contains merged PR #6773 / commit 95d4b25cefdf982ee62758400ff5ff3ce37b6f61,
  which adds the S-MLC-3 weekly-wait-cost harness test to .github/ci/legacy-jobs.yml. It has since
  gained merged PR #6741 / commit 9a9de1afa07f137c4314296bdd3861633654f9e5, which adds the R1A-M
  Intelligence Hub Market Pulse test bindings to that same A1-owned CI manifest, and merged PR #6771 /
  commit 6136f3d41576d5905b2e8a5e4879a04243fee829, which adds tests/test_market_reference.py to the
  existing render-guard + engine-contract pytest command in that manifest. These are newer
  authoritative current-main additions and must survive release reconciliation alongside A1 coverage.

# Eval OS A1 — release + dual-theme visual proof

**Fresh operation:** `eval-os-a1-release-visual-proof-20260830-sol-001`  
**Preferred avenue:** `Opus`  
**Receiver binding:** `CAPACITY_SELECTABLE`  
**Placement state:** `WAITING_CAPACITY / needs_placement`  
**Why Opus:** difficult but bounded authenticated-product visual adjudication plus exact-carrier release verification.  
**Why not Fable:** architecture, evidence semantics, and product surface are already frozen; no principal-level redesign is authorized.

This is a fresh parent-program release wave. The prior A1 recovery child is terminal and its watcher cycle is closed. This operation may use the same canonical implementation PR only after a fresh lawful receiver assignment; it is not continuation of the old worker/session.

## Observable mission

Return PR #6651 as one immutable, then-current-main-reconciled release candidate for which the existing A1 admin evidence view has been deliberately adjudicated in both dark and light art directions, English and Chinese, desktop 1440 and mobile 390, including truthful empty/null/degraded/incomplete states. No code change is required if the existing candidate already satisfies the law and integrates current main without losing authority. GitHub mergeability observations have oscillated and are not themselves a release ruling. A fresh pickup/START-time collision census is binding, and any proven integration conflict must be repaired only on the same carrier while preserving all then-current main authority.

## Canonical carrier and banked truth

- Sole implementation carrier: Macro PR #6651 / `claude/eval-os-a1-evidence-view-20260828`.
- Banked recovery head: `036d5bc01606fc8cb8349094d05c47fb98b6cf7b` until lawfully moved on that carrier.
- Current GitHub state at this reconciliation: OPEN + DRAFT + HOLD + unmerged; mergeability observations remain transient and are not release authority.
- A1 is a deterministic derived read view over T1/T4 and canonical owner evidence.
- `Validated` may be empty; null `output_class` stays null; illegal/mixed bases never pool; model output has zero evidence/promotion authority.
- No persisted score/evidence store, second registry, health store, promotion service, qledger copy, second admin product, queue, or router may be introduced.
- The recovery child already repaired and reviewed the A1-introduced admin import-closure defect. Do not reopen that debugging wave unless current-base evidence actually disproves the banked result.
- Current main contains authoritative `.github/ci/legacy-jobs.yml` additions from #6684 and later movement. Merged #6773 / `95d4b25cefdf982ee62758400ff5ff3ce37b6f61` wires `tests/test_s_mlc_3_weekly_wait_cost.py` into `broad-etf-flows`; merged #6741 / `9a9de1afa07f137c4314296bdd3861633654f9e5` adds the R1A-M shared regular quote projector + Intelligence Hub Market Pulse API/surface/controller test bindings; merged #6771 / `6136f3d41576d5905b2e8a5e4879a04243fee829` subsequently adds `tests/test_market_reference.py` to the render-guard + engine-contract pytest command. Any future same-file reconciliation must preserve every then-current authoritative main addition, including #6773, #6741, and #6771, plus A1's `tests/test_admin_intelligence_os_ui.py` coverage.
- Current main also contains merged PR #6767 / `06bed3b19330728e7d46b9f69fd535f749e51a69` on two A1-owned paths. Its authority must survive: `admin/intelligence_os.py` must pass the sentinel's `site/live/staleness.json` through `STALENESS_REL` to the T4 builder when present and `None` when absent, and `tests/test_admin_intelligence_os.py` must retain the two reader-plane pinning tests. This T4 maintenance does not reopen H1/T4; it is simply newer current-main truth A1 release must preserve.

## Binding design proof

Current Macro `AGENTS.md` governs any material user-facing surface. PASS requires both art directions to be treated as designs, not token substitutions. Before release, capture and adjudicate an evidence matrix covering dark treatment, light treatment, EN/ZH parity, desktop 1440/mobile 390 composition, empty Validated/Disproven bands where applicable, null `output_class`, Accruing/Ungraded-by-design/Degraded/Disproven/incomplete states, and the reference/baseline with any intentional theme-specific mechanisms.

The existing `check_ui_visual_evidence.py` does not inspect `admin/static/`; its success is not this receipt. Do not widen that checker merely to green this operation unless a separately demonstrated owner-level enforcement defect is commissioned.

## Startup / placement protocol

THIS FILE IS SCOPE, NOT RECEIVER ASSIGNMENT. Until the accepted placement owner or an explicit current assignment binds a concrete eligible receiver, keep `WAITING_CAPACITY / needs_placement`; do not post a worker-facing OPEN_PICKUP/PRECOMMISSION and do not arm a receiver-specific watcher.

After lawful placement, on one fresh Slack carrier:

1. `PICKUP_ACK eval-os-a1-release-visual-proof-20260830-sol-001` using actual receiver identity.
2. Read the full carrier, CURRENT protected Mastermind Skillpack, CURRENT Macro main, this handoff, #6651, current design law, and current A1 workstream.
3. Actually arm the exact-thread continuation source and emit truthful `WATCH_ARMED`.
4. Perform a fresh current-main/open-PR/path/source-law collision census, including all 13 #6651 paths, current `.github/ci/legacy-jobs.yml` authority including merged #6773, #6741, and #6771, and merged #6767's two A1-owned paths.
5. If exact current-base reconciliation proves no conflict, do not mutate #6651 for integration housekeeping. If a real conflict is proven, repair only that seam on the SAME #6651 branch, preserving all current-main authority including #6767, #6773, #6741, and #6771 plus A1 coverage.
6. Emit separate `START` only if gates are clean.

## Execution / acceptance boundary

1. Reproduce the current candidate faithfully enough to adjudicate the required visual matrix before touching A1-owned UI code.
2. If all visual cells pass and current-base reconciliation is clean, preserve the head; do not create cosmetic churn.
3. If a material A1-owned design failure or current-base conflict is proven, make the smallest styling/composition/integration repair on the SAME #6651 branch. Preserve information architecture, evidence semantics, state meaning, interactions, density law, #6767 reader-plane behavior, #6773, #6741, and #6771 current-main CI-manifest coverage, and all authority boundaries.
4. After any head move, repeat the full matrix, current-base collision census, complete hosted exact-head CI/fences/security and an independent exact-head review. Do not rely on proof from a superseded SHA.
5. Return immutable head, exact changed-file census, visual evidence receipt, CI/review receipts, current-main reconciliation evidence, inherited-vs-A1 attribution, and any remaining gate as `RESULT / HOLD-FOR-SOL`.

Worker acceptance is still `BUILT_NOT_PROVEN`. Separate Sol-controlled release remains required: Ready/merge/deploy, then authenticated `admin.mastermind-x.com` API/UI proof covering truthful empty/null/degraded/incomplete states, lawful mixed-basis refusal, negative proof of no persisted score/evidence store, and no new promotion authority. Only after production proof may Agent OS/Linear be durably reconciled to A1 `PROVEN_LIVE`.

## Relationship to P1 and E1

P1 `eval-os-p1-promotion-integrity-acceptance-20260830-sol-001` remains held while #6651 is open because #6651 changes `engine/qledger.py` and `scripts/grade_qledger.py`, both on P1's real readiness/grading surface. This operation does not absorb P1.

E1 forward accrual is already PROVEN_LIVE from natural scheduled production. A1 neither reopens E1 nor resolves the deferred general-clock cohort-authority gap.

Only explicit Sol STOP closes this fresh child after it is commissioned. This records-only scope by itself creates no watcher, receiver, START, implementation effect, merge, deploy, or production state.
