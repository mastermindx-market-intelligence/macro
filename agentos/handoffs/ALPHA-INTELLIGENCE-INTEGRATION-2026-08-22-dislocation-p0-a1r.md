mission: >
  Repair Dislocation P0 source integrity after PR #6117 merged before the required
  independent audit. Preserve the 313-row draft as quarantined provenance, reconcile
  source law against merged PR #6068 plus Sol's exact-20 ruling, heal the incomplete
  FTS pool without prices or outcomes, materialize exactly twenty packets through the
  canonical SEC source/document owners, obtain fresh Grok proposals and an independent
  Opus audit, link genuine economic episodes, return the P0-S0/S1 K-packet, and stop.
state_before: >
  PR #6117 had squash-merged as c1f8e352298d8e99f77c22c4c9660b82521e340c.
  Its 313-row semantic draft SHA
  832ac650cf18bd31b593fbb0214d9f3ac1b85ccdda6d417e12e5d81a35b76d32
  had useful deterministic SEC FTS harvest capacity but was produced before the
  frozen twenty-packet proposal/audit gate; its two nominal semantic passes were the
  same deterministic phrase classifier; it directly minted source/document identities;
  nine FTS cells remained incomplete; and it equated one accession with one episode.
  The noncanonical query-ledger SHA 04d502e398a0f2ae65df7b2f9d5156305094f7b10ca104da08792d7219c1f83c
  existed only in prior chat and disagreed with merged PR #6068 in sampling/control
  details. No admissible P0-S0/S1 K-packet existed.

# Dislocation P0-A1R cold-session return point

The independently useful capability now exists at P0-S0/S1 only: twenty
deterministic price-blind packets flow through the canonical SEC source/document
owners with all 27 exact FTS-matched archive members, carry fresh source-only Grok
proposals, receive a separate all-twenty Opus audit under the corrected episode
ontology with replayable spans, and return as an honest one-episode K-packet. The
Claude web account used for the independent audit was an attachment-only reviewer;
it was not connected to GitHub or the repository and performed no delivery action.

Stop here. Sol is the only release authority.

## Current-main reconciliation continuation — 2026-08-23

Sol accepted the P0-S0/S1 K-packet semantically and architecturally on exact
head `45723b127c28028c6e6a82cf93c041741171f5df`. The remaining gate is solely
current-main integration proof. The existing branch was rebased, without a new
carrier, from prior merge base
`fe393bd73e541a37dc23262514e93d9d9056cec7` onto initial reconciliation pickup
`fe0e2a3a755c9a8581c13c482785ed83684fb2d4`, refreshed onto
`fc94d43ad4142e50ec808b2f1a8d6f922ff1fa7b` after landed commit
`787787f93c8efaaf30b9cd3d32d9446596fa0925` changed the shared legacy CI-job
registry, and finally rebased onto fresh `origin/main`
`e6339b03227ae70bede94b15bd7269a9d6c7ec84`, which includes FF-1R merge
`1e7d9f5030fd7c7c06fb03f022857510c5d0f9ed`. These refreshes change CI
topology and add a compatible SEC-owner capability only; they do not change an
accepted P0 selection, source, model, audit, linkage, or K-packet byte.

`git range-diff` proved all seven carrier patches identical. Main's landed
Fundamental Forensics change, PR #5898 / merge
`21f51a1ecfed778a738b048bd7e5efd30b1d9336`, adds EDGAR full-master-index
discovery but does not change the A1R-consumed `SecForensicsCollector.fetch`,
`RetrievalReceipt`, or persistence contract. Both canonical document-spine
owner files are byte-identical to the accepted base. FF-1R PR #6285 is now
accepted mainline owner law at merge `1e7d9f5030fd7c7c06fb03f022857510c5d0f9ed`.
Its only `SecForensicsCollector` delta is an additive, retrieval-only historical
Submissions helper; it does not modify `RetrievalReceipt`, `persist_response`,
`_fetch_url`, `fetch`, generic receipt sidecars, or document-spine contracts.
Independent review returned `COMPATIBLE; no STOP`. Open PR #6286 still touches
`ci.yml` but remains unmerged/non-authoritative and must be rechecked immediately
before the return to Sol.

The exact-20 logical SHA remains `e436c6e87870468d0df0449c86cc9b69a9d23aa1396885fffdfcbfcf6398852e`;
the source-manifest logical SHA remains
`97c2d8f7d518a6ae7ec25f23cb6f796f201c601277647b0bee9e917eb1add667`;
the Grok, Opus, and K-packet file SHAs remain respectively
`98383da61ac11c072a1c0cc10a00218164fb95446c277cf4da212121250fbee2`,
`7c01072dafa92e7f2c4e31723317351694e575f6947185b8112a29a12923a88a`,
and `665628e8d1d217b15239091ca6a4963a2196b3b36c4f850c18a85a0f8da8781e`.
Offline replay under the reconciled tree remains
`COMPLETE_BYTE_IDENTICAL`: 20 packets, 27 exact FTS-matched documents, model
packet-index SHA
`1f6feded5bebe12f0eb09db8a6d0aeec107a98fd22dd34e3167bfa413f59c216`,
and network access `NONE`. No price, outcome, counterfactual, ranking, sizing,
or execution path was mounted or read. No Grok or Opus rerun was required or
performed because every accepted semantic input and hash remained unchanged.
