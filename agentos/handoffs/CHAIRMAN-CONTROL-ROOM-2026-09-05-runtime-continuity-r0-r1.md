mission: >
  Preserve the Runtime domain's current continuity facts for the Autonomy Integrator
  without creating a runtime authority, transferring any source carrier, or treating
  source and local observations as production acceptance.
state_before: >
  The portfolio needed a bounded Runtime-domain return covering protected source,
  terminal RET2 history, Session Truth R1, the fixture boundary, and the existing
  default-disarmed host operation. The connected Executive surface remained a fixture
  with no runtime database and therefore could not establish production lifecycle state.

  - path: agentos/handoffs/CHAIRMAN-CONTROL-ROOM-2026-09-05-runtime-continuity-r0-r1.md
    what: >
      Adds one records-only Runtime domain handoff with exact carrier pointers,
      source-versus-host boundaries, current blocked evidence, and no execution authority.
prs: [170, 322, 350, 357, 406, 427, 471]
verified:
  - claim: Runtime reports that the listed completion, wake, and Relay source carriers are protected.
    command: >
      Runtime domain return to native task 01a06f73-1dba-7951-9f1e-cded7b563cef,
      citing Mastermind master 46a24a1a4083b74bbde8876100a8ca1f720589a9 and Macro
      685d1143251d431360373a6df339c0096df98950.
    result: >
      Domain-attributed source pointers: #427 a945e76b, #322 821e90f8, #406
      b3f01bbc, and #357 b28023f9. This is source-carrier evidence only; it does
      not establish an installed runtime, Worker claim, target acknowledgement, or production result.
  - claim: The prior RET2 canaries are terminal and their shared implementation paths remain occupied.
    command: >
      Runtime domain return citing Slack roots C0BSBM78V1N/1788058869.502559 and
      C0BSBM78V1N/1788239475.408549 plus current shared-path owners #350 and #471.
    result: >
      Both prior roots are terminal. RET2 remains a partial nonterminal semantic-yield
      seam; #350 and #471 must complete or explicitly serialize before any shared-path
      RET2 change. A terminal carrier does not grant a replacement START.
  - claim: Session Truth R1 has a sole held source candidate and no accepted runtime proof.
    command: >
      Runtime domain return citing PR #170 head 14af4c7d, tree 4644e1b1,
      merge-proof 73b357f581e10220a1bf122b73b101c3bbd87ceb, and its 20 disjoint owned paths.
    result: >
      The current-base merge reference has no CI proof. The domain reports the source writer release as
      unresolved; no competing carrier, path takeover, receipt hash, admission, or Task7
      acceptance is established.
  - claim: The new Session Truth evidence child recorded a bounded failed CLI observation, not a receipt.
    command: >
      Runtime domain return for session-truth-r1-current-estate-proof-20260905-runtime-continuity-001
      and its sanitized local evidence at
      /Users/chriswong/Documents/Cluade/Mastermind-session-truth-r1-d1d2-20260827/review_evidence/session_truth/r1-20260905/proof.md.
    result: >
      Actual CLI calls twice exhausted a fixed 60-second window while the canonical dry-run is about
      90 seconds. The child returned BLOCKED_RECORDED/STOP. It produced no receipt hash, admission,
      Task7 acceptance, or source-writer release. A later read-only profile measured 90.908 seconds:
      build_records 81.031 seconds, 69 git_dates calls 80.446 seconds and 140 git subprocesses
      80.509 seconds. The diagnostic was accepted and stopped; it does not accept Task7.
  - claim: The connected Executive state is a fixture and cannot establish production runtime facts.
    command: mastermind_executive.executive_state({})
    result: >
      The Runtime domain reports grounding 7191702e3b0104525b6b26cd30ddb53d89a8a663,
      mode=fixture, runtime_db.present=false, and no production lifecycle counts. This
      is an honest degraded read, not proof that an installed production database is absent.
  - claim: The existing default-disarmed host operation remains pre-START and read-only.
    command: >
      Runtime domain return for w3c-host-install-default-disarmed-20260904-sol-001,

      protected production database remains UNKNOWN behind 0700 permissions. No host START,

    what_would_verify: >
      The incumbent #170 carrier must return an immutable current-head proof with concluded checks,

    what_would_verify: >
      A fresh same-carrier compatibility and host collision census followed by a separately authorized
      action edge; a read-only continuation and source clearance do not authorize START.
unresolved:
  - RET2's nonterminal semantic-yield implementation owner is unresolved beyond the existing #350/#471 shared-path serialization.
  - #170's source-writer release, CI proof, receipt/hash, admission, and Task7 acceptance remain absent from this return.
  - The measured CLI latency mismatch needs source-owned bounded timeout repair after exact writer-release reconciliation.
  - The default-disarmed host operation needs compatibility reconciliation before any separately authorized host action.
next_actions:
  - Query the current #170 source carrier and its owner before any Session Truth work; preserve the 20-path ceiling and do not create a successor while release is unresolved.
  - Reconcile the existing writer and adjudicate the proposed 120-second source-owned default with slow-success and bounded-failure tests, preserving canonical command/error semantics; no CLI override or substitute parser.
  - Reconcile #350 and #471 with their current writers before proposing any RET2 shared-path child; retain the two terminal roots as tombstones.
  - Continue w3c-host-install-default-disarmed-20260904-sol-001 only on its exact carrier after a fresh compatibility and host census; require a new explicit authorization before any mutation.
do_not_redo:
  - Do not revive either terminal RET2 canary or create a replacement carrier because a prior child stopped before effect.
  - Do not treat source #427, #322, #406, #357, or #470 as installed-host or production proof.
  - Do not infer absence of the protected production database from an unprivileged 0700/EACCES boundary or from fixture runtime_db.present=false.
  - Do not turn the Session Truth CLI timeout into a receipt, hash, admission, Task7 acceptance, or writer-release claim.
  - Do not create a RuntimeBinding, queue, lifecycle store, retry plane, watcher, or control plane in this records-only carrier.
danger_areas:
  - The same factual words can describe source protection, local host observation, and production acceptance; preserve the plane label on every return.
  - Native task and Slack continuity prove only transport/coordination unless joined to the canonical Executive Runtime's Worker/Attempt/effect evidence.
  - The root0700 namespace is an unknown-evidence boundary. Circumventing it would replace truthful degradation with an unauthorized host effect.
  - A stopped child or a source-cleared predecessor does not release another carrier's shared paths or authorize an admin action.

## §0 State — what is true right now

Runtime's current return is a records-only continuity checkpoint. Source carriers have been
reported protected, but the fixture has no runtime database, the installed default-disarmed host
release remains disabled, and no accepted production Runtime interval exists.

## §1 What is left — in order

The recovered historical source child is
`session-truth-r1-owner-record-identity-repair-20260828-sol-001`, Slack
`C0BSBM78V1N/1787894522.353989`. The parent named Claude8, but actual ACK/results
were Claude3 (`U0BSLFRGA79`). Its native session
`2338ac1b-1559-4747-bb87-90bdb3b7df3c` was recovered, but its transcript stood
down at `2f0dde` and ceded to a later same-carrier writer. It cannot release `14af4c7d`.
GitHub STOP `5452114913` and source acceptance `5459830615` at `14af4c7d` do not
prove child-source removal or `BRANCH_WRITER_RELEASED` for the final writer.
The final commit/push was positively recovered from Codex child
`01a049a9-a8e5-78d1-8c36-4a671edfdd9c` (session_truth_whitespace_repair), parent
CTO-ORION `01a03330-4c36-7a11-b730-44c591ed3481`. Its actual August 28 execution
created and pushed `14af4c7d`; final receipt says NOT_WATCHER_ENABLED.
Direct app-server input to this historical multi-agent child was rejected, so no
closeout delivery or release receipt resulted. Runtime is routing through the
existing parent's supported child coordination. Positive writer identity does not
itself grant writer release or source repair.
The original Task7 execution root is `1787829948.620029`; `1787876752.102929`
is a separate project watcher and is preserved.

1. Preserve #170's exact holder and obtain its current immutable evidence or a typed release; do
   not substitute a new Session Truth carrier.
2. Repair the measured 60-second Session Truth acquisition timeout through its existing source
   owner; do not convert either the failed proof or the diagnostic into an operational receipt.
3. Wait for #350/#471 ownership resolution before RET2 shared-path work, then require an explicit
   bounded source/proof commission.
4. Keep the existing default-disarmed host operation read-only until a fresh same-carrier census
   and a separately authorized action edge permit any host change.

## §2 What will bite you

The approximate 90-second canonical dry-run makes a 60-second wrapper incapable of proving the
underlying CLI outcome. The local evidence dossier is sanitized observation material only and is
not an Agent OS store, runtime receipt, or authority to inspect protected host state.

## §3 Not in scope

This handoff does not assign a receiver, choose a Worker, alter an installed host, release an
existing writer, or graduate AD-CUTOVER. It supplies Runtime-domain pointers to the Integrator;
Production remains responsible for graduation; the Integrator owns final portfolio acceptance.
