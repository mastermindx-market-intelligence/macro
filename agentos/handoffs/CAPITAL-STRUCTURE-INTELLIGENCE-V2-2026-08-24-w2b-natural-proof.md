mission: >
  Receipt the first natural post-#6287 W2B collector -> Capital Structure chain,
  mark W2B proven live without falsely closing W2, and stop without starting W3
  or W4.
state_before: >
  Sol released exact PR #6287 head f50ba6cf76f0, which squash-merged as
  0a23f1ffcedc at 2026-08-23T06:56:37Z. W2B was BUILT_NOT_PROVEN pending the
  first natural scheduled chain containing that merge. W2 remained in progress
  with 857 inherited unserved LIVE filings.
changed:
  - path: agentos/discoveries/DSC-CS-V2-W2B-NATURAL-CHAIN-PROVEN-LIVE.md
    what: >
      Record the exact natural-run ancestry, reservations, spill, class/lane
      service, runtime, horizon, projection, W1, #5792, fence, twin, and
      authority receipts with falsifier and future operating consequence.
  - path: agentos/workstreams/WS-CAPITAL-STRUCTURE-INTELLIGENCE-V2.md
    what: >
      Mark W2B done and proven live while keeping W2 in progress, the remaining
      337 LIVE debt visible, and W3/W4 held behind W2.
  - path: agentos/handoffs/CAPITAL-STRUCTURE-INTELLIGENCE-V2-2026-08-24-w2b-natural-proof.md
    what: Close this proof wave with reproducible commands and exact receipts.
verified:
  - claim: The first qualifying natural chain ran W2B code and both required jobs succeeded.

      Scheduled run created 2026-08-23T22:49:57Z. Collect job 97273624140
      succeeded 22:50:04Z -> 01:15:57Z. Capital Structure job 97292842139
      succeeded 01:15:59Z -> 02:21:31Z. The merge is an ancestor. No daily was
      dispatched, cancelled, or rerun. Unrelated downstream jobs may continue
      independently of these terminal-success jobs.

      or storage deferral. Current-run arrivals 0, overflow 0. LIVE pending ->
      selected -> unserved was 857 -> 520 -> 337, so inherited debt fell by
      exactly 520 from the prior 857. RECOVERY was unpopulated. HISTORICAL was
      17,797 -> 20 -> 17,777 and retained protected service.

      Current attempts were 540 unique sources, all state=stored with no error,
      error_class, HTTP status, SEC 404, SEC 429, or retry. The 404 census count
      of three is historical and produced no current attempt. The dedicated
      r2_capital_structure write probe still returned storage AccessDenied and
      used the unchanged r2_research fallback; storage_deferred stayed zero.
      Collector wall was 144.7m/240m (60.3%), below the unchanged 204m warning
      and 240m hard lines; sec_capital_structure was 2,256.0s = 37.6m.
      Downstream wall was 65.3m/90m (72.5%). No carrier tripwire fired.

      SEC index dates were all 2026-08-21; expected status complete; discovery

      Horizon degraded_capacity had the sole reason
      live_tail_unserved_after_selection. Compilation failures were 0;
      compiler counts were 2,137 events, 32 edges, 1,535 review items, and
      6,890 source manifests. Health verdict was ok.

    what_would_verify: >
      A later natural scheduled chain must report healthy discovery,
      horizon.state=current, and live_tail_unserved_after_selection=0.
unresolved:
  - "Inherited LIVE debt remains 337; this is the sole degraded-capacity reason."
  - "The dedicated r2_capital_structure store still rejects writes; fallback retained all current work in r2_research."
  - "Company Facts remains default-off/unprovisioned and is outside W2B."
  - "W3 and W4 remain unstarted and held behind W2."
next_actions:
  - Merge only this narrow Agent OS closeout after its own exact-head checks conclude.
  - Continue observing normal scheduled chains; never dispatch, rerun, or create W2C merely to drain debt.
  - Close W2 only at a natural current horizon with healthy discovery and zero unserved LIVE, unless Sol rerules.
  - Return to Sol for W3/W4 sequencing after W2 closes; do not start either here.
do_not_redo:
  - Dispatch or rerun daily.yml to re-prove W2B or accelerate the inherited debt drain.
  - Change the 500/20/20 envelope, carrier, source, queue, job, cadence, timeout, scheduler, identity, horizon, projection, fence, or authority law.
  - Count the historic 404 census or dedicated-store 403 as a current SEC rate-limit response.
  - Treat fresh compiler-generation age as a current information horizon.
  - Mark W2 done while 337 LIVE filings remain unserved.
  - Start W3 or W4.
danger_areas:
  - "degraded_capacity is allowed solely because inherited LIVE debt remains; it is not a failed W2B proof."
  - "RECOVERY was empty, so its protected-service condition was not falsified; its exact 20-slot spill is the relevant receipt."
  - "The overall daily workflow can continue independently of the two required terminal-success jobs; do not interfere with unrelated work."

W2B is done and production-proven. W2 remains in progress until natural
scheduled work drains the remaining 337 LIVE filings and the canonical horizon
becomes current. No W2C, W3, or W4 work is authorized by this receipt.
