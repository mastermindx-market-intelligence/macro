schema_repair: >
  2026-09-01 shape-only repair by claude/executive-os-dr-a0-audit (Fable COO): this record
  shipped without state_before/changed/unverified, with ended_because 'active_dependencies'
  (not in the schema enum), and with bare-string verified[] items, which made
  `scripts/agentos.py validate` exit 1 for the whole store and red the self-mod-fence CI
  step on every records-touching PR. Content and meaning are Sol's and unchanged;
  'active_dependencies' is rendered as 'blocked' (the checkpoint ends waiting on #312's
  PR-bound test and Sentinel #255), verified[] claims are re-anchored to the readback
  receipts this record already cites, and the added fields are the repairer's reading of
  the record's own body, marked as such. Precedent: FF+FIF records repair, Sol PASS on
  macro #6676 (2026-08-30).
state_before: >
  (Added in the 2026-09-01 schema repair, from this record's own body.) Autonomy program
  mid-flight before this checkpoint: W3A build PR #250 closed unmerged on the Draft->Ready
  connector defect with #312 as the sole live release carrier awaiting its PR-bound test;
  Sentinel #255 STARTED_STICKY with exact effect reconciled; #265 held on #255; CF2-H0
  child terminal effect-none on the noninteractive admin-surface blocker; ACK1 plan-only.

mission: >
  Complete the Chairman-authorized Autonomy program without duplicate control planes or replacement
  writers. Remove Slack archaeology, Grok dependency, manual tab waking, watcher repair and Chairman
  account selection; prove exact target consumption, lawful placement, mechanical return, one current
  Sol target, Control Room visibility and a measured zero-touch production fleet.

      No post-ruling write occurred. Dirty paths are exactly the two authorized release allowlists;
      path-ten remains 24 and 24->25 is unapplied. Exact original Sentinel alone may preserve all
      local bytes, join current protected source after a clean ten-path census, apply only 24->25,
      prove the full atomic-retry matrix, expected-head push the same branch, obtain independent
      review/test/CodeQL and return RESULT / HOLD-FOR-SOL.

      Native Draft->Ready failed before effect on the known Repository.fullDatabaseId connector
      response defect. Canonical readback proved #250 unchanged, draft, unmerged and at the exact
      current branch/head. #250 was then closed unmerged; no source retry, branch replacement,
      RuntimeBinding transfer, provider action or logical duplication occurred.

# Return point

This is an active execution checkpoint, not completion. Re-pin protected Mastermind and this exact
file before every modifying action. The immediate lawful action is #312 expected-head merge only after
its own test succeeds; then re-pin and commission ACK1 without duplicating the pending FORGE audit.
Preserve every sticky RuntimeBinding and ambiguous effect. Final acceptance remains a measured
zero-touch production interval, not source protection, CI, merge or QUEUED admission.
