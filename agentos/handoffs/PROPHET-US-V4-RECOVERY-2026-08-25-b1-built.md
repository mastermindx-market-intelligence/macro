session: claude/b1-candidate-episode-20260825
model: codex
ended_because: ci_handoff
mission: >
  Build the one canonical V4-B1 candidate-episode plane, wire exactly one natural
  nightly writer with explicit CI and dataset ownership, record its settled bindings,
  and stop at BUILT_PENDING_NATURAL_ACCEPTANCE without manufacturing production data
  or releasing D5 early.
state_before: >
  A1 was accepted and B1 was dependency-ready, but no durable per-security-epoch x
  structural-anchor candidate episode plane existed. TURN WATCH, candidate snapshots,
  Doors, Radar, identity, plans, rankings, Availability, and graders had separate
  canonical ownership. D5 remained blocked behind B1 and open PR #6275 carried only
  its frozen contract.
changed:
  - path: engine/us_candidate_episode.py
    what: >
      Adds the pure immutable event/replay contract, strict validation, deterministic
      episode/projection builders, and canonical HEAD-referenced reader.
  - path: engine/us_candidate_episode_intake.py
    what: >
      Normalizes exact Data OS identity plus TURN WATCH, candidate, Doors, and Radar
      observations without granting any source new authority.
  - path: engine/us_turn_watch.py and scripts/build_turn_watch.py
    what: >
      Emits the full uncapped private TURN WATCH sidecar from the existing engine-owned
      build while preserving the capped display artifact and existing CI owner.
  - path: scripts/reconcile_us_candidate_episodes.py
    what: >
      Adds the nightly-gated sole B1 writer: read-only report/replay modes, once-read
      source receipts, immutable complete generations, and one atomic HEAD publication.
  - path: .github/workflows/daily.yml, .github/ci/legacy-jobs.yml, and config/dag.yml
    what: >
      Places one hard-failing B1 natural writer after Door emission and before every
      forward grader/W3. The step retains failure visibility but is explicitly limited
      to schedule events, so daily workflow_dispatch skips B1. It stages only
      data/us_prophet_rank/episodes, declares the exact DAG order/--nightly arguments,
      and runs the four B1 suites in
      prophet-us-context-and-grades while TURN WATCH stays in its existing owner.
  - path: config/dataset_registry.yml
    what: >
      Registers six proposed B1 input/output contracts plus every upstream path B1 loads:
      two produced incumbent inputs (context-vector candidates and Door flags) and one
      PROPOSED/STAGED_NOT_ARMED Radar forward projection. Their incumbent owners remain
      explicit, B1 event identity is event_id/content_address, both event and suppression
      lineage list every intake, and only the generation selected by validated HEAD.json
      is canonical. The Radar projection cannot become PRODUCED until its owner freezes and
      validates an exact immutable-event relationship contract.

    what: >
      Pins event identity, PIT intake, atomic publication, natural-lane wiring,
      no-authority boundaries, uncapped sidecar production, and canonical read failures.
  - path: tests/test_dataos_registry.py and tests/test_prophet_off_engine_lane.py
    what: >
      Preserves the original ten registry contracts and four historical identity
      consumers as subsets so lawful registry expansion is not blocked; B1 exact IDs,
      fields, clocks, and new edges are independently asserted by its wiring suite.
      Expands the existing off-engine module/order/gate contract to include B1 and its
      exact DAG declaration rather than leaving live workflow drift.

      Records R1-R5 plus atomic HEAD publication, B1 owned paths, and the bounded
      BUILT_PENDING_NATURAL_ACCEPTANCE state while preserving D5 todo/blocking prose.

unresolved:
  - "B1 is BUILT_PENDING_NATURAL_ACCEPTANCE, not accepted, live, or production-proven."
  - "D5-EARNINGS remains blocked behind B1; PR #6275 remains contract-only and was not absorbed or edited here."
  - "B2, B3, B4, A2, A3, A4, and all other V4 waves remain separate and unchanged."
next_actions:
  - "Complete review, CI, and merge of the single B1 carrier."
  - "Wait for the first ordinary scheduled daily.yml descendant; do not manually dispatch, rerun, replay, or cancel it."
  - "Return the exact natural B1 evidence packet through a records-only acceptance PR, then reconcile and execute D5."
do_not_redo:
  - "Do not create a second candidate-episode ledger, projection plane, identity adapter, structural-anchor finder, or atomic publication pointer."
  - "Do not use ticker/date, Radar runtime episode_id, a reconstructed expert tuple, or recorded_at as semantic event identity."
  - "Do not let candidates, Doors, unanchored Radar, ranking, plans, Availability, or V3 open or govern B1 episodes."
  - "Do not treat an unreferenced generation as canonical or select the newest generation directory without validating HEAD.json."
  - "Do not author tracked production data in a sparse build tree or use a replay/rerun/manual dispatch as natural acceptance."
danger_areas:
  - "The single HEAD replacement is the visibility boundary; sequential target publication reintroduces split truth."
  - "epoch_0 is provisional. A real Stock Identity epoch appends IDENTITY_SUPERSEDED; it never edits or recycles the old episode."
  - "The input sidecar is full and private; site/turn_watch remains capped display evidence and is not the B1 anchor store."
  - "Registry paths beneath generations are resolved through HEAD.generation_id; orphan bytes are noncanonical even when internally valid."
  - "Radar forward lineage is declared but PROPOSED/STAGED_NOT_ARMED. mastermind.entry_event.v1 is source provenance, not the unversioned W5 projection schema; do not promote the row until the Radar owner freezes exact immutable event_id semantics."

# B1 built return — natural acceptance still owed

## Verdict

`BUILT_PENDING_NATURAL_ACCEPTANCE.`

The canonical implementation, natural lane, CI owner, dataset contracts, and durable
rulings exist on one carrier. That is build evidence only. It is not a claim that a
production generation exists, that the natural writer has run, or that D5 is released.

## Acceptance boundary

The accepting session must resolve the exact `HEAD.json`, validate the referenced
manifest and every generation member, bind source/projection hashes to the ordinary
scheduled descendant, and exercise the canonical reader read-only. A green fixture,
manual workflow dispatch, rerun, replay, report-mode receipt, or merge SHA alone cannot
substitute for those facts.
