mission: >
  Sol commission PROPHET-US-LIVE-FORCE-MAJEURE-2026-08-26: determine why US
  Prophet Live stopped updating, restore the lane, reconstruct every
  point-in-time-provable lost session, permanently eliminate the silent-freeze
  class, obtain real production proof, and update durable records.
state_before: >
  Commission scoped the outage to two sessions (2026-08-24/25) from an observed
  "last good ~Aug 21", cause unknown, timer suspected dead. No US Prophet-Live
  repair carrier existed. scripts/check_vps_live_health.py graded eight lanes but
  not US prophet_live; /api/status exposed six live artifacts but not
  prophet_live.json; the evaluator returned 0 on every publication failure.
changed:
  - path: scripts/prophet_live_evaluator.py
    what: >
      Publication is now a CONTRACT. publication_required()/no_publish_set()
      resolve an explicit mode (--dry-run, --no-require-publish,
      PROPHET_LIVE_REQUIRE_PUBLISH, PROPHET_LIVE_NO_PUBLISH kill switch) and
      default to fail-closed. Missing R2 client / failed live PUT / failed event
      spool with events / failed served write on a host that owns a live plane
      exit 3; unexpected exception exits 1 (was 0). Served-write obligation is a
      CAPABILITY test (parent dir exists), never host-name guessing, so runners
      are not failed for a directory they do not own. Partial effects are named,
      never blind-retried.
  - path: app/main.py
    what: >
      checks.prophet_live added to /api/status and ALWAYS emitted, including when
      the artifact is absent. Absolute clocks (pass_ts, quote_asof) with derived
      pass_age_min/quote_age_min; mtime demoted to served_age_min and never the
      truth signal; pack_ok compares pack_as_of to last_completed_session;
      aggregate counts only (public unauthenticated endpoint). expected_now comes
      from engine.prophet_live.live_states so no second holiday calendar exists.
  - path: scripts/check_vps_live_health.py
    what: >
      Dead-man grades the US lane during an expected session: absent /
      unparseable / stale pass_ts (>15m) / stale quote clock (>25m) / wrong pack
      basis / global darkness / missing producer. Deliberately NOT ABSENT-OK —
      a missing prophet_live key during the session is itself a failure. New
      _abs_age_min() refuses naive-local drift and unusable stamps.
  - path: tests/test_prophet_live_silent_freeze.py
    what: NEW 22-test hostile matrix; mutation-verified against pristine modules.
  - path: tests/test_prophet_live_vps_lane.py
    what: >
      Three contract tests re-pinned to the new exit codes (artifact invariants
      unchanged). Drive-by heal: the public-live inventory guard now compares
      Caddy against config/site_access.yml instead of a literal 4-file list that
      had gone stale and was red on main.
  - path: .github/ci/legacy-jobs.yml, .github/workflows/ci.yml
    what: suite wired into prophet-live P0 plus its retrigger paths (no dark tests).
  - path: research/PROPHET_US_LIVE_FORCE_MAJEURE_2026_08_26_EVIDENCE.md
    what: NEW Wave-A forensic freeze + Wave-C feasibility adjudication.

do_not_redo:
  - "Do NOT treat 'nightly Prophet is fresh' as evidence the live lane is fresh — they are separate planes and the nightly stayed healthy through all 27 days."
  - "Do NOT use event-spool absence as evidence no passes ran: zero spool objects exist alongside ~1,500 in-window passes."
  - "Do NOT reconstruct the 11 Class-D sessions (08-03/04/05/06/10/12/13/17/18/19/24). Their dark verdict was CORRECT for the pack they were handed; recovering them means minting a pack production never armed."
  - "SUPERSEDED 2026-08-26 — this entry was WRONG and is kept so the correction travels. Journal-derived rows ARE lawful: `entered` is bool(center_buyable), fixed per name-session and NOT price-derived, so production's own branch-exclusive kinds settle it (at_risk/at_risk_unconfirmed only inside `if on_board:`, crossing_unconfirmed only in the cross branch). 141 of 294 name-sessions determined, 0 contradictions; 153 remain null/unknown. `via` is genuinely unavailable and stays null."
  - "Do NOT rebuild this as a PIT replay. The events already exist in the producer's journal; replaying would require the vanished pack and would MINT a cohort. Recovery reconstructs nothing."
  - "Do NOT commit the expanded pending input (~10 MB). It is stage-and-absorb and regenerates byte-for-byte from the committed 197 KB journal + scripts/prophet_live_journal_recovery.py."
  - "Do NOT re-probe R2 for historical armed packs. Versioning is off and ListObjectVersions is unimplemented; the bytes do not exist."
  - "Do NOT re-litigate the ci-authority/codex/merge-queue-pilot red — it fails by design on every main-based PR."
danger_areas:
  - "live/prophet_live.json has exactly two lawful writers (evaluator + close-pass mirror CAS). Nothing in this wave adds a third; keep it that way."
  - "Manual workflow_dispatch of prophet-live.yml BYPASSES the VPS_LIVE_PRIMARY gate. Never dispatch it while the VPS timer can still publish — that is two writers on one object."
  - "Persistent=false on macro-live-prophet.timer is load-bearing and now test-pinned; a reboot must not replay stale live moments."
  - "D12 is BUILT_NOT_PROVEN on operation prophet-us-d12-pack-tip-hardening-20260827-sol-001: the US pack owner quarantines non-session, not-yet-completed, and malformed last bars before BOTH pack-tip selection and gate submission. Shared armed_pack/CN semantics are unchanged. Do not call this PROVEN_LIVE until the first natural post-merge US pack + evaluator/dead-man proof."
next_actions: >
  1) PRIMARY NEXT: after the D12 carrier merges and reaches the natural production
     pack path, hold the first US pack + live-evaluator proof. Require completed_through
     = the canonical last completed NYSE session; pack as_of must be a real completed
     session at or before that bound; any invalid_series_tip names must be explicit
     non-verdicts; the evaluator must consume the pack without global stale_pack
     darkness; and the external dead-man must report pack_ok=True. Do NOT manufacture a
     contaminated production store merely to force the negative case, and do NOT
     manually dispatch prophet-live.yml while the VPS timer is primary.
  2) INDEPENDENT OPERATOR AUDIT: attribute the 2026-08-26T07:43:28Z R2 credential
     seeding and record the carrier/operator provenance without rotating or rewriting
     working credentials merely to make the record tidy.
  3) HELD INVESTIGATION: classify the partial 2026-07-30 tail after 17:20:56Z. Its
     existence is not replay/backfill authority; any recovery requires the same
     point-in-time evidence law and explicit authority that governed the seven Class-R
     sessions.
unverified:
  - "The 15m pass_ts / 25m quote thresholds held green across a live session but have not been observed against an early-close or DST-boundary session."
  - "The historical D12 contamination SOURCE remains unreproduced/unattributed: the 2026-08-26 pack was clean. The repair itself is discriminator-proven against Saturday, future-session, and NaT hostile inputs; no contaminated production store was manufactured for proof."
  - "153 of 294 recovered name-sessions carry entered=null. They only ever emitted forming/confirming_into_close, which occur on BOTH state-machine branches. Any analysis splitting crosses from board rows must treat that null bucket as unknown, not as cross."
unresolved:
  - "Who seeded /etc/macro-live.env at 2026-08-26T07:43:28Z. It happened ~3 minutes before this session's first VPS connection, from this operator machine, with no PR or Agent OS record. Needs operator acknowledgement."
  - "D12 production acceptance: ownership and implementation are resolved on operation prophet-us-d12-pack-tip-hardening-20260827-sol-001, but capability state remains BUILT_NOT_PROVEN until the first natural post-merge pack/evaluator/dead-man proof described in next_actions."
  - "The 2026-07-30 tail after 17:20:56Z (~13:21-16:15 ET) is a partial lost session not classified R or D."

# US Prophet Live force-majeure — Wave A/B closeout

## The one sentence that matters

US Prophet Live published nothing for 27 days and ~18 NYSE sessions while the
timer fired every five minutes, the state machine computed correct verdicts, and
every health surface reported success — because the 2026-07-30 cutover made the
VPS the primary writer without seeding its R2 credentials, and nothing in the
estate graded this lane.

## Why the commissioned window was wrong

The commission scoped two sessions from an observed "last good ~Aug 21". The
served artifact's own clock says `2026-07-30T17:20:56Z`. The Aug-21 observation
was not the freeze onset — it is roughly when someone happened to look. Grading
an outage from the date a human noticed is exactly the failure
`WS:PROPHET-US-AVAILABILITY` exists to end.

## Session classification (binding for any backfill)

- **Class R — infrastructure loss, backfill lawful:** 2026-07-31, 08-07, 08-11,
  08-14, 08-20, 08-21, 08-25. Correct pack, correct tape, correct verdicts; only
  the PUT was impossible. 598 distinct `(date, ticker, kind)` keys.
- **Class D — correctly dark, backfill REFUSED:** 2026-08-03/04/05/06/10/12/13/
  17/18/19/24. The armed pack carried a same-day, weekend, or lagging `as_of`
  (924 `stale_pack` passes), so `dark` was the right answer for the pack handed
  to the evaluator. Reconstructing them means minting a pack production never
  armed — data manufacture, not infrastructure reconstruction, and outside
  `DEC:FORCE-MAJEURE-SESSIONS-ARE-BACKFILLED-BY-DEFAULT`.

## Backfill EXECUTED 2026-08-27T00:45Z (Chairman authority)

`data/prophet_live/forward.parquet` **now exists and did not before** — never
committed, no history, and its floor is `2026-07-30`, the day the lane broke. The
evidence base had been empty since inception. 598 rows across the 7 Class-R sessions
(90/15/162/143/71/31/86), PR #6484, squash `37014fcbddda`.

Executed as RECOVERY, not replay: every row was emitted by the production evaluator
at the time and read back verbatim from its journal. Nothing was reconstructed, so
the §24.2 no-surviving-pack blocker never applied. The **committed recovery corpus**
has 588 pass records — exactly 84 in each of the seven Class-R sessions, matching the
`:03/5` timer inside the sole 09:25–16:25 ET inclusive window — and 25,958 declared
events exactly equal 25,958 EVENT lines, with 0 mismatches/orphans. The earlier 672
pass count is not reproducible from the committed gzip and is superseded for source-
integrity claims. The 598 distinct ledger-key count still agreed independently via
journal census, recovery-tool distinct keys, and reconciler dedupe before absorption.

Class D's 11 sessions remain REFUSED and unchanged.

## PROVEN_LIVE as of 2026-08-26T15:23Z

Both carriers are merged, deployed and verified against real production during a
live NYSE session — not from CI:

- **#6464** `9eea7386c1f2` — silent-freeze elimination.
- **#6482** `e01895f5fcc4` — `meta.producer` stamp (see below).

§9 proof at the 13:28:05Z / 13:33:05Z natural passes: first publication since
2026-07-30, R2 object advancing, a served copy that had never existed (21,247 B),
zero `no R2 credentials` warnings, `pack_ok=True`, and events accruing again
(25 then 15). Mid-session re-check at 15:23:00Z: `status=live`,
`pass_age_min=2.5`, `quote_age_min=3.2`, `producer=scripts/prophet_live_evaluator.py`,
external dead-man `VPS live plane healthy`.

**The proof earned its keep.** #6464 shipped with every check green and a
mutation matrix that passed against pristine modules, and the first real session
still went red — `prophet_live: missing producer (unowned lane)` — because the
dead-man graded a field nothing wrote. A guard that cannot go green is worse than
no guard. #6482 repaired it. Nothing but a live session would have found it.

## What is proven now

PR #6464 + #6482 are **PROVEN_LIVE**, not merely built: they are merged, deployed,
and were exercised during the real 2026-08-26 NYSE session with advancing R2 + served
objects and the external dead-man demonstrated both red and green states. CI remains
supporting evidence, not the acceptance proof.

The force-majeure recovery ledger is now fully matured for its seven lawful Class-R
sessions: 598 rows, 0 duplicate keys, 598/598 next-close fills. The 11 Class-D sessions
remain refused by design. D12 itself remains visible but unrepaired and separately
owned from this closeout.

## Open operator acts

1. The four R2 keys appeared in `/etc/macro-live.env` at mtime
   `2026-08-26T07:43:28Z`, about three minutes before this session first
   connected to the host. This session did not perform that change and it has no
   carrier or record. It is currently the most load-bearing production change in
   the incident and needs acknowledgement.
2. D12 (pack `as_of` inherits the close-series tip) needs an owner. This wave
   makes it visible; it does not repair it.

## FINAL EVIDENCE MATURATION — 2026-08-27

The one remaining backfill closeout gate is closed. The existing reconciler matured all
86 Aug-25 rows against the 2026-08-26 close: 38 ticker/session pairs → 86 row updates,
598 rows remain, duplicate keys remain 0, `next_close_fill` is 598/598, and no
`FIRST_WINS` or `entered` value changed. Final ledger sha256:
`fb25fcc6b1935d9fdd5e7e2a6e8a5981411acda6825784afb241eceba968c5e0`.
Machine receipt: `data/pit_replay/prophet_live_recovery/_closeout_receipt.json`.

Do not reopen a replay/backfill wave from this incident. Remaining items are separate:
D12 ownership/repair, attribution of the 2026-08-26T07:43:28Z credential seeding, and
the unclassified partial 2026-07-30 tail. Class D stays refused. #6296 is unrelated
and remains HOLD-FOR-SOL.
