mission: >
  ADDENDUM W6-SOL-CORRECTION: fix only the Sol review blockers on the RP1
  ranker (unit-invariant submeasures, canonical priority_value, name-snapshot
  population, real-input receipt, C3 seam + pinned hashes) without starting
  W7/W9 and without examining outcome-conditioned results. Restore W5.1
  Agent OS after the #5834 squash clobber. Return a new head for Sol re-review.
  ADDENDUM W6: implement RP1 Research Priority and open one PR for Sol review.
  W5 original: Run the definitive Live Entry Radar W5 Panel-A/B confirmatory
  replays after #5780 fixed the empty §7 control arm, read the refusal census
  first, report recovered pool sizes and §7 reads, re-check M14/M3, and ship
  the artifacts.

state_before: >
  ADDENDUM W6: W5 done on main (#5825/#5827). W6 was todo. No open W6 collision
  (W8 #5737 only). PR-0 scoring doctrine and W4 live evaluator already merged.
  W5 original: PR #5780 (f8201036c139) was on main. No definitive
  w5_results_panel_*.json existed. The 2026-08-15 5-name smoke spent 81 looks
  with n_refusals=543 vs n_episodes=502 (void). Handoff
  agentos/handoffs/LIVE-ENTRY-RADAR-2026-08-15-w5-control-matching.md left the
  full-panel run as the next action. DSC:REFUSAL-BRANCH-HIDES-A-DEAD-LOOKUP.

  - "_attach_and_match still swallows Exception into control_match_unavailable. A new silent lookup bug would again look like data. Census-first remains the gate."
  - "A sparse worktree still truncates data/trial_ledger.jsonl on write. These runs used a FULL checkout."
  - "Sibling supervisors were restarting --panel A in a loop against the same cache; killing them was required so B could finish and so the manifest would stop growing."
  - "Do not git-add the 278MB per-row A census. Counts live in refusal_census_summary."

## Continuation

The §7 control arm now matches. Panel A: 0 `control_match_unavailable` / 7,546
episodes; FIT empty-cell share ~47%. Panel B: 0 `control_match_unavailable` /
212,593 episodes; TEST G0 empty-cell share 33.6%, C5 13.3%. Q1 is UNINFORMATIVE
on M14 (69.86% < 90%). Q5 is PASS_SHAPED (+13.4 session G0 lead vs incumbent).
Q2 TEST is ACCRUING. Receipt:
`research/live_entry_radar/W5_CONFIRMATORY_RESULTS_2026-08-17.md`.

## ADDENDUM W6 — Research Priority (not done)

RP1 is a deterministic equal-Borda attention ordinal on the live evaluator
projection seam. Policy `research/live_entry_radar/W6_RP1_POLICY.md`. Receipt
`research/live_entry_radar/W6_RP1_RECEIPT_2026-08-17.md`. Durable ledger
`research_priority` stays null. Prophet untouched. Sol reviews the PR against
the frozen outcome/authority firewall. After merge, commission the live
payload before marking W6 done. Do not start W7.

## ADDENDUM W6-SOL-CORRECTION — ranking-law blockers (not done)

#5834 squash-merged while Sol's review was BLOCKED. This follow-up keeps the
W6 architecture and firewalls and corrects only: (1) percentile each
submeasure before combining; (2) ordinal from canonical `priority_value`;
(3) unique-ticker snapshot population with projection onto every expert row;
(4) a genuine real-store `run_pass` receipt; (5) C3 live-seam + pinned spec
hashes; (6) restore W5.1 in `WS-LIVE-ENTRY-RADAR.md` without dropping W6
`in_progress`. Methodological only — no outcome-conditioned inspection.
Do not start W7 or W9. Sol re-reviews the new head.

## ADDENDUM W6-SOL-CORRECTION — bounded follow-up (ranking-law PASSES)

Sol re-review of #5845: core RP1 ranking-law correction PASSES. Do not
redesign the score. Bounded remaining work: (1) same-ticker whitelist
measures must agree or the ticker fails closed (`snapshot_conflict`);
(2) real-store receipt is real-substrate smoke / partial real-input proof,
not the non-empty developing-episode proof (deferred to post-merge RTH/VPS;
do not plant or cherry-pick); (3) W5.1 #5833 shipped serialization;
historical confirmatory dumps predate it; first real distributions arrive
on the next natural evaluation; do not rerun W5 merely to populate them.
W6 remains in_progress.
