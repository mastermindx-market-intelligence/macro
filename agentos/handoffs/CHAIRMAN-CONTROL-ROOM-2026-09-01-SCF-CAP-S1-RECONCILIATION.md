mission: >
  Recover the timed-out MCP Strategy from current canonical sources, identify its live successor,
  reconcile every active CAP-S1 receiver and carrier without creating another control plane,
  adversarially review the sole implementation head, contain a post-STOP duplicate-branch write,
  and leave one exact same-carrier continuation action.
state_before: >
  The August Personal-Pro MCP handoff was stale as a program map: its MAS-48 ingress lane remained
  blocked at C1, while the broader strategy had evolved into Sol Capability Fabric without an
  Agent OS checkpoint. CAP-S1 had two draft PRs (#349 and #350) claiming the same operation and
  editing the same two paths. The original control-room parent preserved Fable as receiver, but a
  later ChatGPT2 PRESTART_REBIND incorrectly claimed no Fable START. After #349 was closed and its
  duplicate child explicitly STOPPED, that child still merged protected master into the closed
  duplicate branch once, creating a fully known post-STOP source effect that required quarantine.

      a two-parent merge of 3c2fb79b and protected 335905ab. Relative to protected master, that
      branch is ahead by two, behind by zero and differs only in the two duplicate CAP-S1 files.

  - claim: >
      Current OpenAI platform permissions still make Personal Pro custom MCP read/fetch-only while

      Exact binary path/version/SHA and generated stable plus experimental schemas, followed by a
      real isolated protocol probe with no ambiguous provider effect.

    what_would_verify: >
      One non-replayed exact-head CAP-S1 canary receipt after all deterministic/fake-server gates,

      bounded outputs and cleanup proof.
unresolved:
  - >
    #350 is only a package-source foundation, not the complete CAP-S1 vertical; V4 registry,
    exactly-one comparator, protocol attestation, projection, structured adapter input,
    fake-server fidelity, canary runner, real provider proof and cleanup remain.
  - >
    Review 5085454178 has three blockers and two major findings that must be repaired before any
    real provider canary.
  - >
    Direct Fable receiver consumption is not observed. The continuation exists in the exact GitHub
    carrier and Slack thread, but no Fable post-review return has been read.
  - >
    CAP-PROMOTE1, checked-in default-policy V4, fleet routes, host receipts, deploy and production
    arming remain separate unauthorized work.
  - >
    MAS-48 C1 remains effect-unknown on its original runtime and cannot be retried or folded into
    SCF as a shortcut.
next_actions:
  - >
    Same Fable receiver re-pins protected Mastermind/Skillpack, reruns the full open-PR
    path/semantic-owner/no-edit census, writes RED tests for review 5085454178, repairs the same two
    #350 paths and pushes one expected continuation head without importing #349 automatically.
  - >
    Sol confirms the quarantined duplicate branch remains exactly 04f5c5ce0d1ec68e9943db008bcd575051ea6a02,
    then fresh-reads the new #350 head/base/files, current protected master, collisions, focused and
    hosted CI and returns PASS or another bounded REQUEST_CHANGES on that exact head.
  - >
    On deterministic review clearance, Fable continues phases 4-15 on #350 through opt-in V4,
    exactly-one observed identity, exact-binary protocol/path attestation, attempt-local Skill
    projection, synthetic journey, exactly one real read-only Codex canary, cleanup and independent
    adversarial review.
  - >
    Only after the complete exact-head vertical is proven and reviewed may Sol consider source-only
    Ready/expected-head merge. CAP-PROMOTE1 remains a later separately admitted operation.
do_not_redo:
  - >
    Do not reopen #349, push further CAP-S1 work to its branch, delete/reset/revert/force-update its
    quarantined 04f5c5ce head, or automatically cherry-pick/copy its bytes into #350.
  - >
    Do not create another CAP-S1 receiver, operation, branch or PR. The Fable binding and #350
    carrier remain sticky until canonically reconciled.
  - >
    Do not accept a post-STOP current-base merge or a modification-safe declaration as authority;
    known unauthorized source effects are preserved and quarantined, not promoted.
  - >
    Do not equate CI success, merged source, Slack delivery, a provider thread or QUEUED admission
    with production proof or final acceptance.
  - >
    Do not start the real provider canary before deterministic, fake-server, mutation, cleanup and
    exact-binary attestation gates pass. Never blind-retry an uncertain provider/process effect.
  - >
    Do not migrate the checked-in default policy to V4, edit routes/host/deploy, arm production,
    widen provider-neutral wire or absorb Business/Browser/PPF/HF1 into CAP-S1.
  - >
    Do not use Agent OS as dispatch, liveness, permission or merge authority; this handoff is
    organizational memory only.
danger_areas:
  - >
    GitHub account/author strings are not receiver identity. Use canonical START chronology,
    operation key, branch/carrier and exact effect receipts.
  - >
    A closed PR snapshot and its live source branch can diverge after closure. Inspect both before
    claiming a duplicate writer is frozen.
  - >
    The verifier's complete-tree claim is security-significant: ignoring empty directories,
    unbounded traversal or blocking special-file races can turn a green suite into a false source
    attestation receipt.
  - >
    Package source/content/closure/grant/generation identities are distinct. A receipt that omits or
    trusts one layer can falsely bind a provider observation to the wrong immutable generation.
  - >
    Protected Mastermind moves frequently. Every new source write/review must pin one exact
    protected SHA and repeat collision/current-base composition checks.
  - >
    The provider canary is effectful even though read-only. Any unknown thread/process/model effect
    freezes the operation; it is not permission for fallback or replay.

# MCP Strategy continuation — SCF CAP-S1 carrier reconciliation

## Capability delta

Before this checkpoint, the timed-out MCP Strategy could be misread as either the old MAS-48
Personal-Pro ingress sequence or a fresh generic MCP build. CAP-S1 also had two implementation
writers with conflicting receiver claims, and the duplicate writer continued once after STOP.

After this checkpoint, current canonical truth is explicit:

- Sol Capability Fabric is the broader strategy successor.
- MAS-48 remains a separate blocked Personal-Pro ingress lane.
- Fable is the sticky CAP-S1 receiver.
- Mastermind #350 is the sole implementation carrier.
- Mastermind #349 remains closed unmerged at its PR snapshot head.
- The duplicate branch is quarantined at known post-STOP head `04f5c5ce...`.
- #350 head `2a64da0e...` is green in hosted CI but formally `REQUEST_CHANGES`.
- No Skill, provider route, host, deploy or production capability has been accepted.

## Final capability state

`CAP-S1 = PARTIAL / BUILT_NOT_PROVEN / PRODUCTION_INERT / DEFAULT_POLICY_V3`.

The current canonical code can parse and inspect part of an immutable package-source contract, but
its verification receipt is not safe enough to feed the frozen source-to-provider identity chain.
No opt-in V4 registry consumer, exact observed Skill comparator, exact-binary protocol attestation,
attempt-local projection, real four-Skill Codex journey or production arming is accepted.

## Exact review blockers

Review `Mastermind#350 / 5085454178` is binding on head
`2a64da0e8287da68a4cce064d4f3cc5b6a3a8bec`:

1. Canonical identifier, SHA-256 and 40-hex validators use anchored regular expressions with
   `.match()`, permitting a terminal line feed under Python `$` semantics.
2. The two source censuses compare only regular files. Undeclared empty directories are invisible,
   and empty-directory forests can exhaust recursion/file descriptors outside the file-count bound.
3. `verify_capability_package_source()` can bless a publicly constructed generation carrying fake
   source/generation digests; its return omits those exact identities.
4. A regular path swapped to a FIFO after census may block before `fstat()` refusal.
5. Repository identity and package-relative path inputs need closed finite grammar before use as
   registry/archive selectors.

## Duplicate-branch disposition

The canonical Chairman START on Mastermind #325 comment `5503766100` preceded ChatGPT2's attempted
PRESTART_REBIND. Receiver binding was already sticky. #349 was closed unmerged and the duplicate
child received STOP, but it later created merge commit `04f5c5ce...` on its branch. That known effect
joined protected `335905ab...` without changing the two-file duplicate delta and without touching
protected master or #350. It is preserved at its current head for forensics and forbidden from any
further write, replay, reset, revert, deletion, reopen or transfer.

The canonical worker dialogue remains nonterminal only for Fable on #350:
`REQUEST_CHANGES / CONTINUE`. Direct Fable consumption remains unverified.

## Highest-authority continuation sources

1. Protected Mastermind `master` and same-SHA `docs/sol_skills/INDEX.md`.
2. Protected SCF convergence index and its package-identity, complete-vertical and protocol
   amendments.
3. Mastermind #325 comment `5503701467` plus Chairman START `5503766100`.
4. Mastermind #350 and exact-head review `5085454178`.
5. Mastermind #349 comments `5504133745` and `5504291642`, plus duplicate branch
   `04f5c5ce0d1ec68e9943db008bcd575051ea6a02`.
6. Slack `C0BRDFZPLHK / 1788318417.573859`, including reconciliation
   `1788321558.055889`, review return `1788321954.959699`, invalid post-STOP continuation
   `1788322178.423109` and terminal tombstone `1788322569.695619`.
7. This Agent OS handoff for cross-session organizational recovery only.

The exact next action is the first `next_actions` item in this record. Nothing in this handoff
admits execution, transfers the receiver, authorizes a provider effect or grants merge/production
authority.
