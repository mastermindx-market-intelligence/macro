mission: >
  Make stale semantic evidence reach the existing ProofFreshness
  reconciliation/reproof path before its historical classifications receive a
  current merge or blocking verdict, without modifying PR #6391 or creating a
  second dispatcher, label, proof store, or refresh ledger.
state_before: >
  Pickup 221f72b413ed8250548f6393ecb665ea894ee293 classified semantic
  evidence inside sweep_pull and returned its blocked disposition before the
  later freshness.stale_for/reprove block. PR #6391 exposed the defect with
  unchanged subject 0f929e4e, historical tested base f2de463c, inherited_base=1,
  unknown=1, and unknown outcome not_run_prior_failure after current main had
  healed the inherited Price-of-Duration defect.

unresolved:
  - >
    Current main inherited eight AgentOS schema errors from the D6-B0 Sol

    local AgentOS validation therefore cannot become globally green without an
    unlawful second repair.
  - >
    The checked-in hosted canary is intentionally read-only and contractually
    forbidden from executing merge_on_green.py; workflow_dispatch sweeps the
    whole armed backlog. The bounded live proof therefore uses the expressly
    permitted disposable draft fixture plus the existing direct sweep_pull seam
    and a write firewall, never main().

    draft HOLD-FOR-SOL PR, and run the write-fenced live single-candidate proof
    from that exact commit.
  - >

    controller head; keep native auto-merge null and do not add merge-on-green.
  - >
    Return the held controller PR and the inherited AgentOS baseline receipt to
    Sol. Do not operate #6391 until Sol accepts and lands this controller wave.
do_not_redo:
  - >
    Do not map unknown, inherited_base, or any semantic classification to
    freshness. A current unknown or regression is final and blocking; a stale
    green is just as non-authoritative as a stale red.
  - >
    Do not add a force-proof label, second workflow dispatcher, retry ledger,
    proof database, or alternate update-branch seam. Existing ProofFreshness,
    reprove(), refresh lease, and live authorization are the one control plane.
  - >
    Do not broaden actual semantic-v1 behavior to pre-epoch legacy_absent
    evidence, and do not let preloaded historical evidence override a pending
    physical proof generation.
  - >
    Do not modify, refresh, relabel, close/reopen, rebase, merge, or use PR #6391
    as a canary. Do not touch FF production or dispatch recovery.
danger_areas:
  - >
    Moving semantic classification ahead of freshness restores the production
    dead end; moving freshness ahead of artifact-mode/binding discovery widens
    legacy or malformed evidence; moving either ahead of pending physical
    anchors can dispatch duplicate generations.
  - >
    A stale receipt has zero current authority, not positive authority. The only
    lawful response is the existing reconciled head becoming unproven and earning
    a new independently bound proof; reproof itself never authorizes a merge.
  - >
    The real canary must call sweep_pull for one exact draft fixture. Calling
    merge-on-green main() would enumerate and potentially mutate unrelated armed
    PRs, and is forbidden for this proof.

## Current boundary

The implementation is locally built and independently reviewed, but the wave is
not accepted or merge-authorized. PR #6391 remains a separate unchanged
production witness. The disposable canary is evidence infrastructure only and
must never land.

## Same-carrier recovery — 2026-09-05 (Claude8 Opus, operation ci-prooffreshness-order-recovery-20260829-sol-001)

The original session above ended pre-CI. Sol re-placed the SAME operation on the
SAME PR #6426 and SAME branch; the preserved head
`9b47c60d9fc5ca8f0e1b5fe9a5d0693fb141eb6e` was never rebased, reset, forced or
replaced.

**Current-base integration.** `origin/main` was merged into the branch with
`--no-ff` (merge commit 0ebb026948ff414499052bba7f1ba6be1e324abf, parents 9b47c60d9fc5 and
aabae60174ab). Both histories are preserved. The single conflict was
`agentos/workstreams/WS-CI-MERGE-CONTROL-PLANE.md`, where main and this branch
each appended to `discoveries:`; resolved as a union with no entry dropped and
no unrelated main byte altered. The candidate's delta against current main is
exactly the seven authorized paths.

**Supersession re-checked, not assumed.** Macro main moved four times during
this session (443fe9a6 → a1b3d9ea → 88af13cf → aabae601). At each re-pin the
newest commit touching `scripts/merge_on_green.py` was still
`8a1b938890614408d7cf3da654d998fc5fe9808a` (2026-08-21), so the temporal-authority
defect was never functionally superseded.

**Bounded repair added** (`PROOF_SURFACE_UNAVAILABLE`, see the DEC amendment and
the DSC's second failure mode): `pull_files()` now classifies HOW the inventory
was observed rather than collapsing five conditions into one `None`. Only a
positively observed transport failure defers with zero non-GET effects;
truncated/broad and complete-unclassified inventories keep their prior
conservative reproof, and an inventory not read through `pull_files` this sweep
also stays on the conservative path.

**Proof.**
- RED→GREEN (new repair): 9 focused tests failed on the merge parent, pass after.
- RED→GREEN (ordering): disabling ONLY the `proof_freshness_disposition()` call
  ahead of semantic classification fails 5 tests, including
  `test_stale_6391_semantic_receipt_reproves_before_unknown_can_block`; restoring
  returns 417 passed. The discriminator is real in both directions.
- Owning suites green: merge_on_green, merge_on_green_semantic, ci_authority,
  ci_semantic_proof, ci_canary_tools, ci_canary_workflows, ship_loop_guard,
  ship_loop_hold_wrapper, ship_loop_semantic — **1018 passed, 0 failed**.
- `python3 scripts/agentos.py validate` — 0 errors.

**do_not_redo**
- Do not treat an unreadable changed-file inventory as staleness. A failed read
  may not author a write; that is the whole point of this repair.
- Do not relax the truncated/broad or complete-unclassified branches — both are
  observed ANSWERS and were passing before this change. They are the control.
- Do not add a retry loop, negative cache, dispatcher or proof store.
  `ProofFreshness` is per-sweep; the next ordinary sweep re-observes.
- Do not emit response bodies or headers in diagnostics. A body is
  attacker-influenced and can echo a token.
- Do not mutate PR #6391 (merged, immutable) or merge #6423 (DO-NOT-MERGE fixture).

**danger_areas**
- `pull_files()` has five callers. Three fail closed on `None`
  (`_touches_semantic_authority` → True, live-inherited-red → None,
  `semantic_main_circuit_decision` → no bypass). Verify any new caller does too:
  transport exceptions now return `None` instead of propagating.
- `note_merged_commit` CORRECTED after adversarial review (see below). It had
  recorded an unreadable footprint as an EMPTY, non-truncated file list; because
  the squash is inserted at the FRONT of the main timeline, that told every later
  candidate in the same sweep the commit changed NOTHING, and a sibling whose
  tested surface overlapped it could merge with no re-proof. It now records
  `truncated=True` when the inventory was not COMPLETE, reusing the window loop's
  existing conservative-reproof law. Any future caller must pass
  `inventory_complete` honestly.

### Adversarial review outcome (2026-09-05)

An independent opus reviewer attacked the exact head and returned one MAJOR
finding that was verified and fixed rather than argued down.

**Finding.** The commit's claim that "its other four callers keep their
fail-closed reading" was FALSE for one of them.
`scripts/merge_on_green.py` post-merge bookkeeping fed `pull_files()`'s answer
straight into `note_merged_commit`, which stored `(list(files or []), False)` —
so `None` became "touched nothing, not truncated", and `files_of` then served
that seeded value instead of performing the real `/commits/{sha}` GET. Scope was
correctly characterised by the reviewer: HTTP/non-list/malformed/truncated
already returned `None` there (PRE-EXISTING hole), while this repair added one
NEW subcase — a transport exception, which previously propagated and aborted the
sweep (fail-closed). Trigger: PR A merges, the `/pulls/A/files` GET then fails at
the bookkeeping call, and sibling PR B merges in the same sweep against a main
commit it was never re-proven against.

**Fix.** `note_merged_commit(..., inventory_complete=False)` records the squash as
TRUNCATED, which the window loop already treats as "cannot be shown to be outside
the surface". Guarded by
`test_a_squash_with_an_unseen_footprint_is_recorded_truncated_not_empty`,
`test_a_sibling_cannot_merge_against_a_squash_this_sweep_could_not_see`, and a
control that the ordinary complete path is unchanged. Both guards were confirmed
RED against the pre-fix bookkeeping line and GREEN after.

**Also from the review, accepted and acted on.** The existing
`test_a_surface_that_cannot_be_determined_is_re_proven` case named "a footprint
that cannot be read" seeds `_pr_files` directly WITHOUT a class, a state
production can no longer produce; its docstring's "every way of not knowing
re-proves" was no longer true. Renamed to name what it actually guards — the
conservative DEFAULT for an unclassified inventory — with the narrowing recorded
in the docstring.

**Known and deliberately NOT changed** (named so a later session does not read
silence as absence):
- `except RateLimited: raise` inside `pull_files` is currently unreachable, since
  `_request` returns `(status, payload)` for every `HTTPError` and never raises
  `RateLimited`. A real 429 takes the `status >= 400` branch and is classified
  UNAVAILABLE, which is the correct outcome. The guard is retained as defensive
  depth, but it is NOT exercised at this seam and no claim should say it is.
- `_semantic_pull_paths` is a SECOND independent `/pulls/{n}/files` reader that
  still returns a bare `None` on `status >= 400`. It feeds
  `_touches_semantic_authority`, which returns True on None, so it is fail-closed
  and safe; the divergence is a consistency debt, not a hole, and unifying the two
  readers is outside this commission's ceiling.
- The generic `except Exception as exc` in `proof_freshness_disposition`
  interpolates `{exc}` into its reason. This repair removes the PR-files transport
  path from reaching it, and the canary test proves that path is clean, but other
  exception sources still flow through that older interpolation.

### Second review pass — the TRUE post-merge invariant (2026-09-05)

A narrow independent pass confirmed the `note_merged_commit` fix clean on all
four load-bearing counts: every `files_of()` consumer (there are exactly three —
`proof_bound_sha`, `_newer_tip_is_only_skip_ci`, and the `stale_for` window loop)
treats `truncated=True` conservatively; a seeded truncated value cannot be
demoted, because the `_truncated_pipeline_paths` flip is reachable only past a
cache MISS while a seed returns from the cache branch above it; and an ordinary
readable merge still records `truncated=False`, so nothing over-blocks.

**It also refuted the rationale this session first wrote down, and the correction
matters more than the fix.** The claim "if `pull_files` raises, nothing is seeded
and a later `files_of` performs the real GET" is FALSE. `note_merged_commit` is
the ONLY writer that inserts the squash into `self.commits`, and every consumer
iterates `self.commits`. If it is never invoked the squash is **absent from the
timeline**, not truncated within it — so nothing ever calls `files_of` on that
sha and there is no later GET to be conservative.

**The real invariant, which a future session must preserve:** post-merge
bookkeeping must either be exception-proof, or the sweep must STOP. Today safety
rests on two lines that are easy to edit apart without noticing:
`pull_files` converts every non-`RateLimited` failure into `None`, and a
`RateLimited` escaping `sweep_pull` hits `break` rather than `continue`, ending
the sweep.

**Latent, currently unreachable, do not "fix" casually:** if a future edit lets
another exception type out of `pull_files`, or demotes that `break` to
`continue`, the sweep continues with the accepted squash missing from
`freshness.commits` entirely. That is STRICTLY WORSE than the empty-list defect
this session repaired, because an absent commit is invisible to all three
consumers rather than merely conservative in them. No code was added for it here:
it is not reachable today, and defensive code around that call risks swallowing
the `RateLimited` propagation the sweep depends on. It is recorded so the
invariant is preserved deliberately rather than by luck.
