session: sol/market-os-a1a-acceptance-20260823
model: sol
ended_because: complete
mission: >
  Adversarially review the complete authenticated A1A production matrix against the
  frozen Market OS acceptance law, reconcile stale same-owner records, issue the
  explicit Sol acceptance ruling if warranted, and leave the exact continuation state
  recoverable without this chat.
state_before: >
  A1A engineering and repairs were merged/deployed and the complete authenticated
  production matrix had passed, but WS:MARKET-OS correctly remained in_progress until
  Sol made the explicit acceptance ruling. PR #6125 had merged after this carrier's
  original base and preserved the earlier BUILT_NOT_PROVEN reconciliation state before
  the later production evidence.
  Separately, RCTX-1 had been commissioned and delivered to Fable through Slack but had
  no ACK, branch, or implementation PR; it was disjoint from A1A.
changed:
  - path: "agentos/decisions/DEC-MARKET-OS-A1A-ACCEPTED-IN-PRODUCTION.md"
    what: >
      Records Sol's explicit A1A PASS ruling, exact acceptance basis, supersession of
      #6125's pre-proof gate state and account-transition clause for A1A completion,
      explicit Scene-9 non-blocking scope, limits of the ruling, and the A1B
      continuation gate.
  - path: "agentos/decisions/DEC-MARKET-OS-A1A-MERGED-PRODUCTION-ACCEPTANCE-REQUIRED.md"
    what: >
      Adds the reciprocal superseded_by link and preserves the record as historical
      evidence while making clear that Scene 9 is not hidden A1A debt.
  - path: "agentos/workstreams/WS-MARKET-OS.md"
    what: >
      Marks A1A done, makes A1B the primary next Market OS wave subject to a fresh
      commission/collision census, preserves the narrow timestamp restoration law, and
      keeps all later waves gated and separate.

    result: >
      PASS — later specific authorities prohibited destructive sign-out/sign-in Scene 9
      while retaining auth-generation protections and commissioning the remaining
      authenticated matrix; Sol accepted that matrix, so the older account-transition
      clause is superseded for A1A completion rather than retained as hidden debt.

      PASS — only server-generated created_at and updated_at are excluded from
      restoration equality; row identity, owner, semantic fields, multiplicity,
      Watchlists, Macro-Terminal agreement, and ordered row IDs remain exact.

    result: >
      PASS — current WS says the sole remaining A1A gate is Sol acceptance; #6125
      merged as ed66b11297bb and is preserved as the older pre-proof reconciliation.

    result: >
      PASS — RCTX-1 is an explicitly disjoint parallel subwave; Slack state is
      DELIVERY_ONLY with no ACK and no implementation branch/PR at review time. It is
      neither A1A evidence nor an A1A predecessor.

      Immediately before A1B modification, refresh Macro main, protected Terminal

      owner contracts; then issue one bounded commission if clean.
  - claim: "RCTX-1 has been picked up by Fable"
    what_would_verify: >
      Explicit operator/runtime ACK or a canonical RCTX implementation branch/PR tied
      to the merged #6300 packet. Slack delivery alone is insufficient.
unresolved:
  - "A1B is authorized to be commissioned next but is not built, started, or accepted by this closeout."
  - "RCTX-1 remains DELIVERED only until real pickup evidence appears; do not fail it over to another builder merely because Slack has no reply."
  - "The Portfolio still has no authenticated offline write outbox; A1A acceptance does not change that boundary."
danger_areas:
  - >
    Do not interpret A1A acceptance as permission to reuse the existing Watchlist/ENTERED
    paste path for Portfolio import; A1B must write only canonical portfolio_positions
    under a separately proven stable-identity, atomic/idempotent contract.
  - >
    Do not broaden the semantic-v2 restoration exception beyond server-generated
    created_at and updated_at; owner, ids, semantic fields, multiplicity, Watchlists,
    product agreement, and ordered row IDs remain exact.
  - >
    Do not interpret Slack delivery of RCTX-1 as ACK or runtime claim, and do not fail
    it over to another operator merely because no reply exists yet.
  - >
    A1B dispatch still requires a fresh live worktree/runtime collision census. The
    committed Active Build Map is advisory and can be stale, and Terminal PR #429 is an
    active collision risk if PortfolioView/quote-demand paths are touched.
next_actions:
  - >
    PRIMARY: perform a fresh A1B collision/owner census against current Macro and
    protected Terminal, then commission exactly one Portfolio Fast Start Import vertical
    if clean. Preserve canonical portfolio_positions identity/authority, atomic and
    idempotent persistence, lost-response safety, and Macro-Terminal conformance. Do not
    absorb A2-A6.
  - >
    PARALLEL: leave RCTX-1 bound to its existing #6300/Fable delivery. Reconcile when an
    ACK, branch, PR, or explicit return appears; do not create a duplicate carrier or
    auto-failover.
do_not_redo:
  - "Do not repeat the final authenticated A1A production matrix absent contradictory production evidence or an explicit new Sol recommission."
  - "Do not treat merged #6125's pre-proof BUILT_NOT_PROVEN state as the current gate; preserve it as historical reconciliation evidence."
  - "Do not reopen Scene 9 as hidden A1A debt; any future identity-transition production test requires separate authority."
  - "Do not broaden the semantic-v2 restoration exception beyond created_at and updated_at."
  - "Do not let Watchlist membership, temporary baskets, local fallback, mixed weighting completion, or fabricated clusters re-enter canonical Portfolio population/risk semantics."
  - "Do not call A1B started or built because A1A is accepted."
  - "Do not treat RCTX Slack delivery as ACK/execution."

# A1A Sol Acceptance Closeout

## Verdict

**PASS — A1A is accepted in production and may be marked done.**

The proof is not inferred from merge state or CI. It comes from the real authenticated production matrix on the canonical Portfolio path, including the exact negative states that originally made A1A necessary.

## Capability delta

Before: an authenticated user could not rely on the Portfolio surface to remain canonical across empty, partial, mixed-sizing, and cloud-failure states without risk of Watchlist/local/fallback contamination.

After: the production Portfolio authority seam has been demonstrated to preserve canonical population, explicit assumptions/abstention, authenticated degraded/unknown failure semantics, Watchlist separation, private-data boundaries, and Macro-Terminal agreement across the frozen acceptance matrix.

## What remains false

A1B Fast Start Import is not implemented. No later Market OS intelligence, Security State, What Changed, Portfolio intelligence, alerting, or forecast wave becomes complete by this ruling. RCTX-1 also remains a separate unacknowledged implementation commission.

## Exact return point

Recover current truth in this order: `DEC:MARKET-OS-A1A-ACCEPTED-IN-PRODUCTION` -> `WS:MARKET-OS` -> final authenticated matrix -> architecture freeze. The next primary modifying action is a fresh, bounded A1B commission only after current collision checks.
