  Fable COO takeover of the K3E Expectation Market Dynamics program (Chairman
  commission 2026-08-25): re-pin authority, run a fresh collision and source-law
  census, record the owed EVAL-0 activation receipt, and refresh the stale K3E
  capability ledger — records only, before the natural T2 proof window opens.
state_before: >
  All four K3E foundation waves were merged 2026-08-23 (K3E-0 freeze PR #6329
  merge 2a90b59423b5; SRC-A1 implementation PR #6342 merge dc51502ba1b0; VEND-0
  PR #6339 merge f53f8e77b360, conclusion SAMPLE_REQUIRED/PROBE_FURTHER; EVAL-0
  PR #6341 merge 8185690d04dd, registration K3E-EVAL-0-V1). A genuine natural T1
  was produced by daily.yml scheduled run 32790724676 and published in engine
  commit be061c6d49e9 (2026-08-25T05:42:31Z) creating
  data/revisions/expectation_observations.parquet and expectation_attempts.parquet.
  No natural T2 existed, so SRC-A1 remained BUILT_NOT_PROVEN. The frozen EVAL-0
  registration requires an activation receipt (activation_receipt_required: true)
  binding accepted commit, digest, merge timestamp, and resolved NYSE session —
  no such receipt existed anywhere on origin/main. CURRENT_CAPABILITY_LEDGER.md
  was pinned 2026-08-23 and predated every one of those merges.
changed:
  - path: "research/alpha_intelligence/expectation_market_dynamics/eval0_activation_receipt.v1.json"
    what: "New records-only activation receipt for K3E-EVAL-0-V1: binds accepted merge commit 8185690d04dd96f871fa4858c6352ff2a95880eb, canonical digest 986ec117e8517b77e8dece565fd9d9dc169e758beb9d1619acc443e061ef87fd (recomputed, byte-identical since merge), mergedAt 2026-08-23T16:08:05Z, and resolved first eligible NYSE session 2026-08-24; explicitly marked retroactively created 2026-08-25 with the honest note that no prospective activity predates it. Changes no evaluation law."
  - path: "research/alpha_intelligence/expectation_market_dynamics/CURRENT_CAPABILITY_LEDGER.md"
    what: "Refreshed from the stale 2026-08-23 revision to current truth: all four foundation merges, natural T1 receipts, SRC-A1 BUILT_NOT_PROVEN with open T2 proof law, EVAL-0 activation receipt, 2026-08-25 collision census, gated downstream sequence, and the exact next action."

    result: "agentos: 709 records (49 workstreams, 225 decisions, 178 discoveries, 257 handoffs) — 0 error(s), 33 inherited warning(s)"
unverified:
  - claim: "C1 parquet contents match the prior observer report (~11,200 prospective observations, 200 attempt receipts, typed missingness, distinct clocks, one honest partial)."
    what_would_verify: "Reading the parquet bodies from commit be061c6d49e9; deliberately deferred to the C2 audit, which must read both collections' bodies anyway."
  - claim: "The next natural daily.yml run will execute the engine job and produce a C2-bearing commit."
    what_would_verify: "The scheduled run itself (~2026-08-25T22:30-23:30Z start, engine commit ~2026-08-26T05:30-06:00Z). If the run does not execute the engine, that is not C2; the honest incomplete state persists."
  - claim: "No remote branch beyond the 60 newest touches the K3E path surfaces (6,268 remote branches exist; the exhaustive scan exceeded the shell timeout)."
    what_would_verify: "A full for-each-ref path-diff sweep run offline, or simply the absence of any surprise PR against these paths at the next census."
unresolved:
  - "SRC-A1 is BUILT_NOT_PROVEN until a natural second scheduled collection C2 (called T2 in the takeover commission; C-numbering avoids collision with the registration's T1-T8 target IDs) passes the proof law in handoffs/SRC_A1.md and the ten mutation gates in DATA_CLOCK_RIGHTS_MATRIX.md for a comparable same-security/same-metric/same-horizon slice."
  - "Sibling worktree alpha-k3e-evidence-vector-855c3a (branch claude/alpha-k3e-opportunity-evidence-vector) sits at main tip with no commits/PR — the canonical K3-E Opportunity Evidence Vector lane, distinct from this program per the K3E-0 naming law. Path-disjoint today; re-census before EXP-1."
next_actions:
  - "Observe (never dispatch) the next natural daily.yml run; on a C2-bearing engine commit, run the SRC-A1P audit: later scheduled collection gets its own session/attempt lineage even when values are unchanged; unchanged values fabricate no revisions; changed payloads append/supersede with lineage; prior as-known observations remain recoverable; partial/failure/null cannot overwrite good state; fiscal rollover is not a revision; clocks stay distinct; no current snapshot backfills an earlier cutoff; publication went through the real scheduler path."
  - "On PASS: flip SRC-A1 to PROVEN_LIVE in the ledger, write the Agent OS closeout with immutable run/job/artifact/commit receipts, and update the WS record at that wave boundary."
  - "Then a fresh collision census, then EXP-1 (deterministic expectation read-model with a real consumer) as its own bounded PR. MKT-1/CPL-1/PHASE-1 stay strictly sequenced behind it."
do_not_redo:
  - "VEND-0 public vendor research is complete (PR #6339): conclusion SAMPLE_REQUIRED/PROBE_FURTHER. No vendor contact, trial, terms acceptance, purchase, or confidential sample ingestion without separate current Chairman authorization."
  - "EVAL-0 law is frozen and immutable (K3E-EVAL-0-V1, digest 986ec117…ef87fd). Never rewrite or 'improve' the preregistration after later evidence; amendments require the registration's own new-version/new-forward-boundary law."
  - "K3E-0 architecture, DEC-K3E-EXPECTATION-MARKET-DYNAMICS-FREEZE, and DEC-SRC-A1-PROSPECTIVE-EXPECTATION-SOURCE-CONTRACT are settled; do not re-adjudicate ownership, storage, or clock semantics."
  - "Do not manually rerun/recreate/cancel the engine workflow to manufacture C2 — natural runs only."
danger_areas:
  - "K2-B (merged via PR #6370 on 2026-08-24T17:53:03Z) owns contracts/institutional_intelligence/**, lib/institutional_intelligence.py, and its tests on main — same parent workstream, never touch from K3E lanes."
  - "Canonical K3-E (Opportunity Evidence Vector) is NOT this program despite the similar name; consuming its contracts later is lawful, absorbing or renaming it is not."
  - "MAS-118/MAS-119 are separate owner programs; K3E progress never 'completes' them."
  - "The two SRC-A1 parquet artifacts live under data/, which sparse worktrees omit — never git add -A an unexpected data/ diff; read historical bodies via git show from the producing commits."
  - "No fair-value, rank, gate, size, trade, Prophet, lifecycle, or publication authority anywhere in this program; UNESTIMABLE/UNAVAILABLE/STALE/LOW_COVERAGE/RIGHTS_BLOCKED remain valid outcomes."

Fable COO takeover records wave. Authority chain at takeover: protected Sol
Skillpack pin 51f9942733b86e550bb9169d2a43462bd28e774f (equal to protected
master head at load time; INDEX and skills loaded from that exact SHA), K3E
freeze DEC, SRC-A1 source-contract DEC, masterplan, DATA_CLOCK_RIGHTS_MATRIX,
EVALUATION_PREREG + eval0_preregistration.v1.json, BUILD_SEQUENCE, and the
2026-08-25 GitHub/Agent OS census recorded in CURRENT_CAPABILITY_LEDGER.md.
This wave is records-only: no runtime, collector, evaluation, vendor, or
product mutation. The program continues under Fable ownership through the
natural T2 proof and the gated EXP-1 → MKT-1 → CPL-1 → PHASE-1 sequence,
returning to Sol/Chairman only on the frozen escalation conditions.
