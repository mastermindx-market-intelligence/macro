model: fable
ended_because: complete
mission: >
  LEDGER-ERA owed-session production settlement (four frozen legs per CEO Sol's
  2026-08-20 directive), then — on a clean receipt — open and land the
  SHADOW-CONTRACT wave (zero-authority rank/discovery challenger substrate,
  packet §9) without a further permission cycle.
state_before: >
  LEDGER-ERA merged 273883182d9b but unsettled (workflow-green is not
  settlement). Shadow substrate did not exist; packet §9 + two DEC precedents
  (paired-row conditions, own-column-family) governed its design.
changed:
  - path: agentos/workstreams/WS-PROPHET-HK-CA-REVAMP.md
    what: >
      ledger-era -> done with the full population-reconciled settlement
      receipt (every denominator difference accounted: 436 = 400 legacy + 36
      current; 36 = 18 filled-unmatured + 18 not-yet-fill-eligible); sentinel
      persistence follow-up diarized for ≈2026-08-26; shadow-contract ->
      in_progress with the frozen-contract state.
  - path: research/PROPHET_SHADOW_CONTRACT_V1.md
    what: >
      NEW — frozen storage+isolation contract for the HK/CA challenger
      substrate. Frozen only AFTER an Opus adversarial pre-implementation
      review FAILED the draft (5 merge-blocking: HK isolation-by-ordering was
      factually false; K1 vacuous at the CA call site; lane-gated no-op kills;
      unbounded schema-union in a public repo; incumbent_rank re-derivation).
      K-suite K1-K14 + positive-control / non-vacuity / static-fence standing
      clauses. Post-review clarifications block records n1/n2/n4 + the M4
      Lane-B key widening (security_ref_raw joined the key).
  - path: engine/board_shadow.py
    what: >
      NEW — market-parameterized {HK,CA} shadow writer: Lane A rank pairs +
      Lane B discovery stores under data/prophet_shadow/, schema allowlists +
      outcome/authority denylist that OUTRANKS the allowlist at the write
      seam, lane gates mirroring board_ledger (fail-closed), normalizer bound
      to board_ledger._definition_or_none by object identity, incumbent_rank
      read back from the board parquet (never re-derived), prospectivity
      triple-refusal (asof / wall-clock settle / behind-the-head),
      first_seen_at true-min carry, identity canonical_ref + raw-ref
      collision counting, deep-copy at entry, empty challenger registry with
      registry_state log lines, fail-soft into builds.
  - path: scripts/build_canada.py
    what: one fail-soft write_shadow call after the board-ledger block (downstream of the artifact write).
  - path: scripts/build_hk_library.py
    what: >
      one fail-soft write_shadow call BELOW the hk_standouts.json write —
      deliberately NOT at the append_board site, which sits ~189 lines
      upstream of publication with the published list objects mutable in
      scope (review finding F1).
  - path: tests/test_board_shadow.py
    what: >
      NEW — 40 tests: K1-K14 kills with positive-control arms (forcing
      off-lane collapses 19/36 of the original suite — controls are real),
      non-vacuity asserts, cross-store validator, repo-wide K6 static reader
      fence with per-file pinned token-form allowlist, write-surface fence
      (all writes confined to data/prophet_shadow/).
  - path: .github/ci/legacy-jobs.yml
    what: >
      new merge-gated `board-shadow-substrate` job (gate: code); PLUS
      engine/board_shadow.py added to unrun-picks-boards' curated
      scope-exclusive paths (the #6093-class closure red the post-build
      review caught live).
  - path: agentos/decisions/DEC-PROPHET-HKCA-SHADOW-IS-A-SEPARATELY-KEYED-LANE.md
    what: NEW — design decision record (sidecar stores vs paired row), with the compensating cross-store invariant.

    the compensating controls. A full-checkout integration test remains an
    option before any challenger PROMOTION wave.

do_not_redo:
  - All LEDGER-ERA and CA-TRUTH do_not_redo entries (PROPHET-HK-CA-REVAMP-2026-08-20.md) remain binding.
  - Do not re-run the K1-K14 executed-mutation suite — executed and recorded on heads dca6e874/a755263c (round-2 review + commissioning session).
  - Do not move the HK write_shadow call back beside append_board (F1 — upstream of publication is a contract breach even if bytes match).
  - Do not "fix" canada_standouts.json to carry board_track — the artifact has NEVER carried it (single-write-site ordering, CA-TRUTH design); the scorecard's consumers are the rendered page + ca_track_ledger.json.
  - Do not narrow _LANE_B_KEY back to (session_date, security_ref, challenger_definition) — keep-first then destroys collision rows (M4).
danger_areas:
  - >
    The K6 fence's per-file token-form allowlist must be tended: a NEW
    legitimate use of the literal prophet_shadow anywhere outside
    engine/board_shadow.py requires an explicit reviewed allowlist entry, and
    bare occurrence COUNTS were proven maskable (net-zero swap) — never
    regress to counts.
  - >
    The denylist-outranks-allowlist property lives in _apply_write_seam's
    effective-schema filter; a refactor that reindexes against the raw schema
    re-opens the reviewed-one-line hole (FAMILY_REGISTRY minting size_/gate_
    columns that are denylisted yet written).
  - >
    Registry is EMPTY at merge by design; registry_state log lines are the
    only liveness signal until a challenger registers. Wire the stores into
    surface-freshness vocabulary in the wave that registers the first
    challenger — not before.

# Session narrative (cold-stranger summary)

Settlement strictly before construction: the LEDGER-ERA receipt was proven on
production bytes across both canonical lanes, with the run-color trap named
(the real CA bake concluded 'cancelled' from one late unrelated job while every
settlement job succeeded; the DST-twin run concluded 'success' building
nothing). One locus correction: the receipt spec expected board_track inside
canada_standouts.json, but the artifact has never carried it in any era — the
in-memory attach happens after the single write site; substance was verified
against the production parquet instead, and the correction is recorded so the
wrong expectation dies here.

The shadow substrate then ran the full loop twice over: contract drafted →
Opus review FAILED it (the draft's central isolation argument was factually
wrong for HK) → contract rebuilt and frozen → Sonnet build → Opus post-build
review MERGE-BLOCKED it (a live CI closure red plus five kills that did not
kill) → fixes → every previously-escaping mutation re-executed to a FAIL. The
wave's lesson, twice paid: a kill is only as real as the mutation someone
actually ran.

## Addendum 2026-08-22 — post-merge Sol correction: market-scoped registration

Sol's post-merge review falsified the merged substrate's registration seam:
CHALLENGER_REGISTRY was keyed by challenger_definition ALONE and write_shadow
iterated every registration regardless of market, so the first real registrant
would have executed and written in BOTH the HK and CA lanes. Zero production
registrants existed, so the unscoped API owed no compatibility.

Repair (same three files: engine/board_shadow.py, tests/test_board_shadow.py,
research/PROPHET_SHADOW_CONTRACT_V1.md): registry re-keyed
(market, challenger_definition); register_challenger(market, definition, ...)
fail-loud on unknown market; _registrations_for(market) is the sole scoping
seam (returns (definition, spec) pairs so K19's mutation is observable rather
than surfacing as a safe KeyError); four POST-GATE registry_state values
(no_challenger_registered / no_challenger_for_market / wrote_n_rows n=n /
error, each with a registry_state= log token) behind unchanged pre-gates plus
a new reentrant_refused refusal; per-registration failure isolation
(challenger_failed definition=d, siblings still run, written counts stay
truthful); malformed registry keys skipped-not-fatal; overwrite warns;
market-scoped write-surface fence. Kills K15-K20 plus reentrancy /
malformed-key / overwrite / cross-market-collision tests — 52 total — with
TWO executed mutation arms (market-blind seam flips exactly the six new kills;
error-state collapse now fails K20). The Opus adversarial round MERGE-BLOCKED
the first repair build with findings D1-D10 (K20's error rung was asserted by
literal injection; the contract's absolute "structurally incapable" claim was
falsified by a reentrant-challenger reproduction; the m2 write fence was
market-blind); all ten were repaired and re-killed before ship.

Contract truth: §4's isolation claim is now TRUST-BOUNDED — the substrate
never mis-lanes a registration, reentrant calls are refused fail-soft, and a
registered challenger is trusted reviewed in-repo code, not hostile input the
registry defends against.

do_not_redo additions:
- Do not re-run the D1/D4 executed mutation arms — recorded in this addendum's
  PR; the in-suite K19 arm remains the standing automated kill.
- Do not "simplify" _registrations_for to return bare definition names — the
  pair return is load-bearing for K19's observability (recorded deviation).
- Do not treat a wrote_n_rows pass containing challenger_failed warnings as an
  error state — that is the D7 semantics, frozen in contract §4.
