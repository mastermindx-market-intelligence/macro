mission: >
  Record, for a cold successor in either Claude account, the Chairman's
  2026-09-05 PDT override placing two co-equal Claude "Meta-CEO" seats
  (Meta-CEO A = Claude8 Code session 5b29ad85-0490-42c8-b5e4-1e32b1922014;
  Meta-CEO B = Claude3, already hosting F08/F13) directly under Chairman
  Chris in command of the Market Ontology program, relieving the ChatGPT CEO
  ("Sol") and the Grok Secretary transport of authority over this program;
  the lane split between the two halves; the coordination protocol on
  macro#6819; and the exact state of the program's PR/ledger/cross-repo
  backlog at the moment of the override, so work can start without a further
  Sol/Chairman round-trip. This handoff is durable state for
  DEC:CHAIRMAN-OVERRIDE-CLAUDE-META-CEO-REGIME-2026-09-06, not a substitute
  for reading that DEC.
state_before: >
  Prior to this override the program's governing baseline was
  agentos/handoffs/MARKET-ONTOLOGY-F00-META-CEO-CONTINUITY-PRODUCT-RESET-2026-09-05.md
  (F00 principal = this same Code session 5b29ad85, bound after quarantined
  1727abca), additively updated by
  agentos/handoffs/MARKET-ONTOLOGY-F00-CONTINUITY-PRINCIPAL-RECONCILIATION-2026-09-05.md,
  under the layered Chairman -> Main Meta-CEO Sol -> Codex Work Program CEO
  -> Project CEO/Integrator/Auditor Sols -> COO/workers hierarchy recorded in
  agentos/handoffs/MARKET-ONTOLOGY-META-CEO-PROGRAM-CEO-HIERARCHY-AMENDMENT-2026-08-29.md.
  Under that hierarchy, 11 of the 13 tight-regex-matched open Market Ontology
  PRs in the macro repo carried an explicit HOLD-FOR-SOL (or HOLD-FOR-F13)
  body, unreleasable by any Meta-CEO/COO session, and F01-F13 lane sessions
  were individually bound (see do_not_redo below) but largely at
  census/spec-frozen readiness, not shipped-and-live. Chairman Chris then
  wrote, verbatim, in the Claude8 Code session chat: "I have overridden the
  ChatGPT CEO and placed you as Claude Meta-CEO for this project... First i
  want you to create a counterpart who can be responsible for half of the
  project tasks... Then i want you both to immediately intiiate fan out of
  building the complete build out of MarketOntology autonomously end to end
  without requiring ChatGPT orchestration or oversight..." (full quote in
  DEC:CHAIRMAN-OVERRIDE-CLAUDE-META-CEO-REGIME-2026-09-06). This handoff
  records the regime that quote establishes.

## Body

This handoff is the durable record backing
`DEC:CHAIRMAN-OVERRIDE-CLAUDE-META-CEO-REGIME-2026-09-06`. Read that DEC
first for the question/answer/rationale/verbatim-quote/alternatives; this
file exists so a cold successor in either Claude account (or a nightly
regenerator, or a nightly reader of `docs/AGENT_OS_STATE.md`) can find the
lane split, the coordination protocol, and the concrete backlog state
without re-deriving them from Slack or from this session's chat transcript,
which is not a durable citation surface.

### Lane split (§3 of the frozen decisions seed)

Meta-CEO A (Claude8, this session) owns F00 shared shell/nav/contract
freeze + integration, F01 (12 ledger rows), F02 (10), F03 (16), F04 (9),
F05 (4), F10 (5), plus the cross-cutting F01F13 Market Orientation project
(`DEC-MARKET-ONTOLOGY-MARKET-ORIENTATION-PROJECTION-2026-08-30`, currently
unplaced) — 56 ledger rows plus the shell. Meta-CEO B (Claude3) owns F06
(3), F07 (5), F08 (7, already resident), F09 (29), F11 (6), F12 (18), F13
(6, already resident), plus the Supabase migration-namespace settlement and
the Terminal identity/tenant contract freeze F11/F12 depend on — 74 ledger
rows plus the platform. Shared surfaces (Macro shell vs Terminal shell) are
each owned by the half whose repo they live in; a cross-half touch is
labelled `meta-ceo-shared` and reviewed at the owning half's next wave
boundary, not blocked on it.

### Coordination protocol (§4)

Running log = comments on macro#6819, one per wave boundary per Meta-CEO
(wave id, packets shipped with merge sha + live URL, packets failed, ledger
rows closed, next wave). Durable state = this handoff for half A and a
parallel `MARKET-ONTOLOGY-META-CEO-B-<date>.md` for half B, each written
only by its own owner. No new stores. A held-PR takeover requires a fresh
read of the PR, a wait of one wave if another live session commented within
2h, an Opus `reviewer` pass against fresh `origin/main`, then the normal
merge-on-green chain. No waiting protocols remain for this program: no
HOLD-FOR-SOL, no READ_ONLY_ARCHAEOLOGY as a lane state, no
DECISION_REQUEST-to-Sol, no exact-root Slack re-read before every act — a
fresh GitHub-state read before every push/merge is still required by
standing fleet law, independent of Sol.

### What DONE means for this program (§2)

Every one of the 130 ledger rows is terminal with proof: NEW_BOUNDED_BUILD /
UPGRADE_EXISTING_OWNER / PROJECTION_ONLY rows merged AND live-verified
(live URL + readback/screenshot in the PR body), ledger status updated in
the same or next PR; BLOCKED_RIGHTS rows carry a recorded Chairman/
commercial rejection, not a build; CONTEXT_ONLY / EXACT_EQUIVALENT rows
carry a pointer to the existing owner. "Done" for any single packet remains
merged + live-verified per standing fleet law — never "PR open."
