mission: >
  Wave C2 of operation marketontology-coverage-semantic-closure-fable-principal-20260902-sol-001:
  granular F00C closure over the exact 130-row ADMITTED_NOW denominator — every row
  adjudicated with granular disposition, confirmed owner, real producer, real consumer,
  missing contract/proof, correction/supersession behavior, next bounded child, and
  acceptance test; five REJECTED_BY_DESIGN/authority dockets prepared for explicit Sol
  ruling; zero capability promotion.
state_before: >
  Wave C0 (denominators/rights/collision ledgers) merged as a2bf2112a04e (#6746). The
  ADMITTED_NOW denominator existed only at the coarse F00B tier
  (COARSE_CROSSWALK_COMPLETE): 130 rows with owner/state/disposition but no granular
  producer/consumer/contract/correction/child/acceptance fields — UNASSESSED 130/130 at
  the granular tier. F00B carried 27 UNVERIFIED flags and 5 pending Sol candidates, and
  several sibling carriers had merged after its census (states potentially stale).

      New 130-row granular-closure OVERLAY (the F00B crosswalk is not rewritten):

      PROJECTION_ONLY 20 / BLOCKED_RIGHTS 7 / CONTEXT_ONLY 7 / PENDING_SOL_RULING 5 /
      EXACT_EQUIVALENT 5), refreshed capability state (exactly 2 evidence-backed
      corrections vs F00B), real producer/consumer paths, missing contract/proof,
      verified correction behavior, next bounded child, acceptance test, inherited
      owner/rights/ceiling columns.

verified:
  - claim: "The F00C ledger covers exactly the ADMITTED_NOW id set with zero duplicates and zero empty required cells."

  - claim: "Exactly two capability-state changes exist vs F00B, both evidence-backed: MO-PAID-060 and MO-DELTA-019 NOT_BUILT->PARTIAL (engine/ipo_radar.py window_context() at L79 over collectors/ipo_calendar.py falsifies F00B's 'grep clean')."
    command: "programmatic state diff F00B.capability_state vs F00C.capability_state_c2 over all 130 ids"

unresolved:
  - "RESOLVED IN THE C2R AMENDMENT — the five dockets were RULED by Sol (macro#6748 comment 5504596085 / CEO carrier 1788325004.496539) and the rulings are folded into the ledger rows: 048 + 050 REJECTED_BY_DESIGN/RIGHTS_GATED_UNLICENSED; MO-DELTA-040 REJECTED_BY_DESIGN_CURRENT_PRODUCT_SHAPE/DEFERRED_POST_TENANCY; MO-PAID-024 AUTHORITY_REFUSAL + BLOCKED_DEPENDENCY; MO-DELTA-006 SPLIT_LAWFUL_NOW_VS_CALIBRATED_HELD."
  - "MO-PAID-020 — RULED: owner is WS:MARKET-OS/F06; Stock Identity/Data OS are owner dependencies, not child write authority; a single bounded renderer/CIK repair is admissible only after fresh collision census and stays CAPACITY_SELECTABLE / WAITING_CAPACITY (not this operation's to self-assign); owner-path mutation returns OWNER_BOUNDARY_REQUIRED."
  - "D2C receiver-candidacy was DECLINE-HELD by the Program CEO (1788321571.229299) — zero D2C effects; never re-raised from this session; MO-DELTA-004's exposure-mapping consumer stays sequenced behind a future lawful placement edge. The same ruling records D2C→D2E→W3B→W3C as NOT executed."
  - "K2-C: #6711 is CLOSED/UNMERGED/SUPERSEDED (main already carries the Autonomy repair) and #6710 was CEO-rejoined to current main @f1ee0592 — still DRAFT/HOLD, WAITING_CAPACITY, receiver NONE; Wave C3 stays gated on lawful placement + proof, not on this session. K3-D (#6514 runtime-binding) unchanged; Wave C4 remains reconciliation support only."
  - "BLOCKED_RETAINED_P1 external delivery gate open (C1 runbook merged in a2bf2112a04e)."
next_actions:
  - "DONE: the consolidated Program CEO carrier packet was posted (1788324992.505239) and Sol's five docket rulings were folded into the ledger by the C2R amendment (this head) — PENDING_SOL_RULING is 0."
  - "Wave C5/C6 sequencing after the D2C binding decision: flagship candidates are the F11 Thesis-object vertical (046->047->053, reusing the verified correction contracts) and the buildable-now F09 slices (maturity-wall, covenant-text, premium-math, coverage matrix) — each as a row-bound child with a real consumer."
  - "Waves C3 (K2-C) and C4 (K3-D) activate only when their upstream carriers clear, through the existing carriers."
  - "On P1 originals arriving: F00A-lawful admission, then Wave C7 expands closure to the 1,556+460 denominator at the same zero-loss standard."
do_not_redo:
  - "Do not re-run the seven-lane row archaeology from scratch — refresh only rows whose sibling carriers move next (the ledger's state_delta column records what was already refreshed and why)."
  - "Do not treat MO-PAID-060/MO-DELTA-019's PARTIAL as a promotion precedent — it is an evidence correction (code exists), not proof of product capability; promotion still requires production receipts."
  - "Do not schedule MO-PAID-038 as a build child — it is a deliberate HOLD (DEC:MARKET-INTEL-PRODUCTIZATION-NO-NEW-WORKSTREAM); its next step is a release adjudication."
  - "Do not mint second correction mechanisms where the verified substrates govern (macro_thesis, falsifier_tripwires, capital-structure chains, credit forward log, theme_graph store, K1 contracts)."
  - "All C0 and F00B do_not_redo entries remain binding (no #6725 revival, no D2C/K2-C/K3-D self-claim, no denominator collapsing, no Desk-corpus substitution, no census re-runs, no second analysis-lifecycle/RMS engine, no competitor authority inheritance)."
danger_areas:
  - "The five PENDING_SOL_RULING rows must not be built, absorbed, or quietly closed while their dockets are open — the disposition is the ruling's to set."
  - "BLOCKED_RIGHTS rows (7) and the rights-adjacent F09 source questions must never be commissioned as builds before their explicit Chairman/commercial gates — recording the gate is the ceiling of lawful progress."
  - "F03's absorption into #6604 depends on #6604 remaining the commissioning owner — if that carrier closes or is superseded, 14 rows' next_bounded_child pointers need re-adjudication, not silent execution."
  - "Merged records/freeze commits (#6522, #6543, #6529, #6596) read as capability progress to careless queries — the ledger's sibling notes explicitly mark them records-only; keep that distinction alive in any downstream consumption."
prs:
  - "Wave C0: #6746 (merged a2bf2112a04e). Wave C2: the records-only PR carrying this handoff + the two F00C artifacts."

# Market Ontology F00C granular closure — Wave C2 (2026-09-02)

Cold-stranger summary: the ADMITTED_NOW denominator (130 rows) is now granularly closed —
every row carries disposition, owner, producer, consumer, missing contract/proof,
verified correction behavior, a bounded next child, and an acceptance test, with exactly
two evidence-backed state corrections vs F00B and zero capability promotions. The
closure claim is scoped to ADMITTED_NOW alone; the retained P1 corpus (1,556 + 460)
stays a separate externally-gated denominator. Five dockets go to Sol; the
child-convergence ledger in the companion summary maps every row onto an existing
carrier or a named bounded child. Read the summary MD first; the CSV is the row truth.
