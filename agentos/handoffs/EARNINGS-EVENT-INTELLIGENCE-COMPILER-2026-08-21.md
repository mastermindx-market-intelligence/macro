  E3-0 FINAL AMENDMENT PASS on PR #6161 only. Execute Sol review 4998678880.
  Do not redesign the accepted compiler. Keep DRAFT + hold + do-not-merge.
  Do not begin E3-A.
state_before: >
  PR #6161 HEAD c5d1f6a616f3 held the original freeze with decided_by
  coo-fable, transcript source_available_at including conference time,
  post-hoc E3-A thresholds, singular respondent, identity_not_in_source,
  candidate_id provenance, and vacuous E3-B/C/P completion. Sol review
  4998678880 accepted the thesis and requested those seven closures.
changed:
  - path: research/earnings_intelligence/e3/E3_EVENT_INTELLIGENCE_COMPILER_FREEZE_2026-08-20.md
    what: Sol-4998678880 closures — clocks, leakage-free E3-A, qa_exchange.v1, candidate-store law, non-vacuous B/C/P, current FIF pin.
  - path: research/earnings_intelligence/e3/E3A_AAPL_SHADOW_EXTRACTION_HANDOFF_2026-08-20.md
    what: Leakage-free gold-then-inference sequence; no auto-unlock of E3-B.
  - path: research/earnings_intelligence/e3/E3B_AAPL_LIVE_QA_HANDOFF_2026-08-20.md
    what: Non-empty AAPL Q&A required for completion; respondents[]; no candidate_id.
  - path: research/earnings_intelligence/e3/E3C_SECOND_EVENT_GENERALIZATION_HANDOFF_2026-08-20.md

  - path: research/earnings_intelligence/e3/E3P_NATURAL_CYCLE_COMMISSIONING_HANDOFF_2026-08-20.md
    what: Natural eligible print must mint ≥1 accepted exchange; resilience receipts are not done.

    what: Amended next_action, stop conditions, needs_ceo ratification question.
  - path: agentos/decisions/DEC-E3-EVENT-INTELLIGENCE-COMPILER-NOT-SCORER.md

unverified:
  - claim: Sol ratifies this amended freeze.
    what_would_verify: Sol review comment closing 4998678880 plus hold labels cleared by Sol
unresolved:
  - Nested event_source_clock.v1 is specified, not implemented.
  - qa_exchange.v1 item validator is specified, not implemented.
  - E3-C issuer is a procedure, not a name; GOOGL package is not currently held.
  - Numeric Q&A usefulness threshold is deliberately unset at N=7 until E3-A gold or a Sol grant.
  - Local Qwen ai_costs gap is named for E3-A to close; not closed here.
  - Freeze ratification of #6161 is still HOLD-FOR-SOL.
next_actions:
  - Sol reviews the amended DRAFT HOLD PR #6161. On ratify, a new session starts E3-A from E3A_AAPL_SHADOW_EXTRACTION_HANDOFF_2026-08-20.md.
  - Do not begin E3-A, model calls, gold files, R2, Terminal, or FIF from this session.
do_not_redo:
  - Do not reopen E2-T1 or E2-D product.
  - Do not treat earnings_qual scores as event_workspace truth.
  - Do not dump clocks onto sources[] without the nested schema key.
  - Do not bump parent schema to event_workspace.v2 for this.
  - Do not freeze GOOGL without a held completeness receipt.
  - Do not mint deflection/evasiveness labels.
  - Do not create a durable candidate store in E3-A or E3-B.
  - Do not stamp conference time as transcript source_available_at.
  - Do not auto-unlock E3-B without a pre-frozen or Sol-granted usefulness gate.
danger_areas:
  - Open nested dicts look additive and are not (Terminal strip + public glance pair).
  - Flagship constants in event_workspace.py must not become the Q&A extraction path.
  - A v2 404 without code=event_workspace_not_covered is deploy failure, not coverage miss.
  - N=7 invites a post-hoc usefulness story; the freeze forbids it.
  - Vacuous empty-Q&A completion would launder infrastructure survival as capability.

Amendment pass complete as architecture. Runtime starts only after Sol freeze ratification.
