   cycle_data.js — Cycle Intelligence Dashboard · curated dataset
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the hero overlay, the scorecard sparklines and the
   (future) per-asset deep pages. Every number here is research-grounded and
   web-verified to mid-2026 (see research/CYCLE_INTELLIGENCE.md for sources).

   The oscillator is normalised "cycle position" on a 0–100 axis where, for EVERY
   cycle, 100 = euphoric cyclical high (price top / tightest credit spreads /
   deepest market calm) and 0 = capitulation low (crash / spread blow-out / vol
   spike). Credit and volatility are therefore stored in *risk-on* semantics:
   a "peak" = complacency/tights/calm, a "trough" = the stress event. That single
   convention makes the overlay legible — every line HIGH = late/expensive/
   euphoric, every line LOW = washed-out/stressed/cheap.

   turns[].t  : "YYYY-MM" (parsed to a decimal year by cycle_app.js)
   turns[].k  : "peak" (oscillator 100) | "trough" (oscillator 0)
   turns[].v  : raw level for the tooltip (price / index / bps), or null
   turns[].e  : the coincident event (one phrase)
   now        : the June-2026 read (phase, position, last turns, prose, confidence)
   proj       : the regime-conditioned forward path (next turn, central + range,
                drivers, falsifier, tilt) — all tweakable / Opus-updatable.
