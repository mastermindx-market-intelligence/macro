The US alone is ~75% of world market cap and trades near 25x forward earnings, an extreme that makes global breadth deceptively narrow under the cap-weighted surface. The backdrop turned less friendly: under new Chair Warsh the Fed held at 3.50-3.75% for a fourth meeting but flipped its dot plot toward a hike, with the 10Y near 4.4-4.5% and DXY at a one-year high around 101.6.",

It lacks the megacap tech that powered the US, so it underperformed badly in the 2010s growth regime but shines when energy, financials and value lead. Bull cycles ride commodity super-cycles and re-rating of cheap UK assets; bears come from oil/metal busts, global credit crises and sterling/rate shocks.",

The index ended 2025 at 9,931.38 (+21.5% on the year), so the 2026 year-to-date gain is a more modest ~6%. Despite record nominal highs, valuation is undemanding — trailing P/E ~14.9 and CAPE ~20 — so the move reflects an overdue re-rating of cheap UK value/cyclicals plus heavy buybacks rather than froth. It is therefore late-expansion but not euphoric; the soft patch since February ties to Middle East energy volatility and a still-subdued UK economy."

The melt-up is powered by Japan's 10.5 trillion yen 'physical AI' investment plan, a yen pinned near 160/USD that flatters exporters, and chip names (Advantest, Screen, Taiyo Yuden) leading daily. Valuations are full and have stretched with the run-up: the only published Nikkei-225-specific multiples are stale (Siblis Jan-2026: trailing P/E ~17.9, CAPE ~29.4), and after a ~25% further price move the current trailing P/E is in the low-20s (broad TSE Prime P/E was ~25 in June 2026) with CAPE near the mid-30s. So the risk is less a 1989-bubble valuation air-pocket than a sharp yen reversal or AI-sentiment crack of the kind that produced the Aug-2024 carry-unwind crash (indeed the Nikkei dropped ~4% intraday on 2026-06-26 on tech selling, SoftBank -10.8%)."

In a year when Japan and Taiwan melted up and Korea crashed, Australia went sideways. The February record — an unusually strong earnings season, a ~38% twelve-month resources run on China-stimulus hopes, and the tail of the FY25 bank re-rate that made CBA the ASX's largest stock — gave way to a 9.1% slide to 8,366 by March 23 after the RBA delivered the first of three surprise 2026 rate hikes (3.60% to 4.35% by May, the highest cash rate since 2011). Since then the index has oscillated in a roughly 8,600-9,000 band and sits ~0.5% above its 200-day average: war-driven oil above US$110 keeps trimmed-mean inflation re-accelerating (3.6% in May, RBA sees a 3.9% peak), banks flipped from FY25's best sector (+24.3%) to negative in FY26 (CBA -11%, still ~26x trailing versus its 16.9x decade median), iron ore faded from ~US$111 to ~US$100 on China's property slump, and the gold miners — the year's standouts as bullion peaked at US$5,417/oz in January — have cooled with gold back near US$4,072. Breadth is thin: at the February record only ~12.5% of constituents were within 10% of their own highs. This page prices Australia through the US-dollar EWA cycle, so the engine reads phase = Downturn with the position oscillator near 80 and a cautious, high-risk-bounce stance: the USD ETF marked its peak in April 2026 — two months after the local-currency record — and momentum has rolled over since. The −4% is a plateau in A$ terms that, seen through the currency, is an early rollover for a dollar holder — stretched but not washed out."

This extreme semiconductor and export-cycle beta makes the index among the highest-beta proxies globally to the memory-chip pricing cycle, global trade volumes, and USD/KRW direction. Historically burdened by the 'Korea discount' — low ROE (~7% decade average), opaque chaebol structures, and low dividends compressing valuation multiples to roughly 1× book — the 2024-2026 Corporate Value-Up Program and Commercial Act fiduciary reform under President Lee Jae-myung structurally raised shareholder returns and began compressing that discount. Foreign investors (~35–40% of market cap) are acutely sensitive to USD/KRW: a weak won triggers outflows that further weaken the won, creating a self-reinforcing loop amplified by North Korea tail risk on geopolitical flare-ups.",

The 2025–2026 melt-up was the most compressed secular re-rate in the index's 46-year history: from the April 2025 tariff-crash trough of 2,294, the KOSPI surged +297% as Samsung and SK Hynix rode the AI/HBM memory supercycle to roughly 60% combined index weight by June 2026. RSI-14 climaxed at 83.9 on May 11 while the index traded 67% above its 200-day moving average — exhaust signals verified on-tape. The ATH was marked by divergence: RSI of only 66.6 at the June 22 peak versus 83.9 at the May climax, a 17-point lower RSI on a +16.5% higher price. The crash since has been acute: KOSPI fell 8.95% on July 13 alone, triggering a 20-minute circuit breaker, as SK Hynix dropped 15.4% on an HBM4 ramp-shortfall note. The engine confirms phase = Downturn, oscillator pos_v2 ≈ 97 (historically elevated), and AVOID stance. The provisional trough was 6,807 on July 13; the bounce to 6,848 on July 16 is tentative.

The latest leg lower is driven by a hawkish Fed pivot under new chair Kevin Warsh (held at 3.50-3.75% on June 17, dot plot tilting toward a possible hike) plus a global tech rout and a sharp Chinese-tech selloff — Alibaba slumped to a 16-month low after Anthropic accused it of illicitly extracting capabilities from its Claude model — with Middle East tension adding to risk-off. Valuations remain among the cheapest of any major market (trailing PE ~12.9, CAPE ~14.7, ~3% yield), so this reads as a cyclical correction within a still-incomplete recovery rather than a fresh capitulation."

Busts follow tightening, deleveraging campaigns, regulatory crackdowns, or external shocks (2008 GFC, 2018 trade war, the 2021-24 property/tech unwind).
